{"id": "\n  Acting Attorney General tied to fraud scheme under FBI investigation", "paragraph": "Watch VideosThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting a criminal investigation of a Florida company accused of scamming millions from customers during the period that Matthew Whitaker, the acting U.S. attorney general, served as a paid advisory-board member, according to an alleged victim who was contacted by the FBI and other people familiar with the matter.The investigation is being handled by the Miami office of the FBI and by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, according to an email sent to the alleged victim last year by an FBI victim specialist. A recording on a phone line set up by the Justice Department to help victims said Friday the case remains active.Mr. Whitaker, appointed Wednesday by President Trump to replace Jeff Sessions as head of the Justice Department, oversees the FBI in his new job.Let\u2019s back up for a minute, because the details are almost hard to believe.Whitaker joined the company\u2019s advisory board after having served as a U.S. Attorney in the Bush/Cheney administration \u2013 a fact World Patent Marketing exploited to lure potential clients.Four years ago, the company issued a press release that quoted Matt Whitaker as saying, \u201cAs a former U.S. attorney, I would only align myself with a first-class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business ethically and translates them into action.\u201dThose comments started to look pretty bad after the Federal Trade Commission filed a civil suit against this World Patent Marketing, describing it as \u201can invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars.\u201d Among its alleged victims are many disabled American veterans.Now, the company is facing possible criminal scrutiny from the FBI, all while one of the company\u2019s top officials is running the Justice Department.It\u2019s a dynamic that sounds like fanciful fiction: the president unilaterally empowered Matt Whitaker to serve as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official, while a company Whitaker helped lead is at the center of a multi-million-dollar fraud scheme being investigated by the FBI.And before you think his work on World Patent Marketing\u2019s advisory board meant his connection to the company was unimportant, note that according to Federal Trade Commission, Whitaker wrote threatening emails to the company\u2019s customers, pressing them not to complain about having been defrauded by the firm.Among those subpoenaed as part of the FTC\u2019s case against World Patent Marketing was none other than Matt Whitaker, your new acting attorney general.If you\u2019re wondering why a president would elevate such a person to an immensely powerful post, it\u2019s important to note that the White House apparently had no idea about Whitaker\u2019s connection to the company \u2013 because he wasn\u2019t vetted.If there\u2019s a defense for such a move, I can\u2019t think of it."}
