{"id": "\n  This Week in God, 10.20.18", "paragraph": "Watch VideosFirst up from the God Machine this week is a look at a striking evangelical perspective on the suspected murder of Jamal Khashoggi from one of the nation\u2019s most infamous religious right leaders.On Monday morning, TV preacher Pat Robertson told his \u201c700 Club\u201d audience that Khashoggi\u2019s apparent slaying is less significant than an arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia. As the estimable Kyle Mantyla reported at Right Wing Watch reported, Robertson returned to the subject a day later.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to cool the rhetoric,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cCalls for sanctions and calls for punitive actions against the Saudis is ill-advised\u2026. You\u2019ve got a hundred billion dollars\u2019 worth of arms sales \u2013 which is, you know, that\u2019s one of those things \u2013 but more than that, we\u2019ve got to have some Arab allies. We have to have it! We cannot alienate a biggest player in the Middle East who is a bulwark against Iran.\u201dWhen Robertson\u2019s co-host Wendy Griffith argued that we cannot have governments killing critical journalists with impunity, Robertson dismissed those concerns.\u201cWe\u2019ve had so many people killed,\u201d he responded. \u201cWe\u2019ve had CIA people killed in Lebanon. People have been taken hostage over the years. I know it\u2019s bad, but we\u2019ve had all kinds of stuff, but you don\u2019t blow up an international alliance over one person. I mean, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dA few things. First, there is no $100 billion arms deal. Second, Robertson was perfectly willing to jeopardize an international alliance over one person when the person was a Christian evangelist in Turkey. Third, drawing a moral parallel between the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2013 as if the two countries have comparable records on human rights \u2013 is quite a departure from the right\u2019s usual approach to patriotism.But even putting these relevant details aside, the televangelist\u2019s on-air comments were emblematic of just how far some evangelical Christians are prepared to go to defend Donald Trump\u2019s position. Christian principles about the value of human life are nice, but a multi-billion-dollar arms deal that doesn\u2019t really exist is, evidently, quite a bit nicer.Stephen Colbert, dressed in a robe and a fake beard, did a great bit on his show this week, pointing to the Ten Commandments\u2019 prohibition on killing, and joking about its apparent asterisk: \u201cThou shalt not kill \u2013 unless there\u2019s a lot of coinage on the table\u2026. If that be the case, then the big guy upstairs is more than willing to look the other way.\u201dIt\u2019s worse, of course, given the fact that there isn\u2019t even a lot of coinage on the table.Also from the God Machine this week:* Federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania: \u201cThe Department of Justice issued subpoenas to Catholic leadership in Pennsylvania on Thursday in following a grand jury report this summer that alleged hundreds of priests in the state molested young children for years. The dioceses of Allentown, Harrisburg, Erie, Greensburg, Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have received subpoenas and intend to cooperate with federal investigators.\u201d* Litigation worth watching: \u201cTwo conservative Christian groups in Texas believe that businesses and employers have the legal right to discriminate against LGBTQ workers on religious grounds, and they\u2019re trying to get the courts to back them up. The US Pastors Council and Texas Values, two nonprofit evangelical groups, filed multiple lawsuits in state and federal court this week, claiming that Christian businesses and churches have a constitutional right to fire \u2013 or not hire \u2013 LGBTQ workers.\u201d* And Politico recently reported that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is often accused of advancing a foreign policy that routinely seems to put the interests of one faith tradition over every other: \u201cEven some supporters of the administration concede that its actions have created the impression that the Trump government favors Christians over other faiths, a perception fueled by the powerful influence Christian evangelicals wield in Trump\u2019s electoral base.\u201d"}
