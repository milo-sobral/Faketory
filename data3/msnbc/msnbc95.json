{"id": "\n  Trump raises eyebrows with treatment of black women journalists", "paragraph": "Watch VideosAt a White House press conference last week, PBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor reminded Donald Trump that he\u2019s described himself as a \u201cnationalist,\u201d which she suggested may have emboldened white nationalists. Before she could continue, the president interrupted to accuse her of asking \u201ca racist question.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a racist question, though it was the start of an unfortunate series of comments Trump directed at black women journalists.Two days later, in response to a question about CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, the president decided to go after April Ryan. \u201cI mean, you talk about somebody that\u2019s a loser, she doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe gets publicity, and then she gets a pay raise or she gets a contract with, I think, CNN. But she\u2019s very nasty, and she shouldn\u2019t be. She shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dA few minutes later, CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip had this exchange with the president about his acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker.Q: Do you expect Matt Whitaker to be involved in the Russia probe? Do you want him to \u2014TRUMP: It\u2019s up to him.Q: Do you want him to rein in Robert Mueller?TRUMP: What a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.Yamiche Alcindor, April Ryan, and Abby Phillip have a few things in common: they\u2019re all women journalists; they\u2019re all African American; and they were all on the receiving end of presidential indignation last week.I imagine the White House and its allies believe Trump shows contempt for anyone who gets in his way, and these reporters\u2019 race was irrelevant to the president. Perhaps.But there\u2019s also a pattern of recent behavior to consider. A few months ago, for example, Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cLeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201dAround the same time, Trump delivered a series of speeches in which he attacked Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) as a \u201clow I.Q. person.\u201dMore recently, the president blasted Florida\u2019s Andrew Gillum as a \u201cthief\u201d and Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams as \u201cunqualified.\u201dIt matters, of course, that Trump\u2019s admonishments about each of these men and women have been factually wrong, but it also matters that the president seems to express a special indignation toward certain groups of people.It\u2019s not subtle."}
