{"id": "\n  Reality discredits fraud allegations from Trump, Florida\u2019s Scott", "paragraph": "Watch VideosDonald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve peddled election-related conspiracy theories \u2013 Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Marco Rubio (R) have, alas, dipped their toes in the same misguided waters \u2013 but the president and the governor have been more aggressive than most and have done the most damage to their credibility.Let\u2019s start with Scott, who has a dwindling lead against Sen. Bill Nelson (D), and who dispatched Florida law enforcement officials to find evidence to back up his ideas. That didn\u2019t turn out well.State election monitors in Broward County told The Miami Herald on Saturday that they\u2019ve seen no evidence of voter fraud. And Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, a Democrat, said he has seen no evidence of voter fraud in the county. In addition, the state agency tasked with overseeing elections said it is not investigating any claims of voter fraud.It\u2019s almost as if the governor publicly raised the prospect of \u201crampant fraud\u201d as part of a panic-induced public-relations scheme, rather than based on meaningful proof of wrongdoing.After Florida law enforcement told the public that there\u2019s no evidence of fraud, Scott went to Fox News to once again raise the prospect of fraud.All of which looked pretty bad for the governor \u2013 though the president\u2019s take may have been slightly worse.Trump started tweeting about Florida\u2019s election results on Thursday, pointing to \u201cfraud\u201d that did not, and does not, exist. A day later, he lied about the discovery of \u201cmiraculous\u201d votes, and vowed to dispatch lawyers to \u201cexpose the fraud\u201d that doesn\u2019t exist.On Saturday, while in France to recognize the 100th anniversary of World War I, Trump kept up the offensive, publishing a tweet accusing Democrats of \u201ctrying to STEAL two big elections.\u201dThis morning, the Republican president called for Florida to stop counting votes, raised the prospect of \u201cforged\u201d ballots, and condemned the uncounted ballots as \u201cinfected.\u201d Trump added, \u201cMust go with Election Night!\u201dIn other words, since his preferred candidate is currently ahead, Trump wants officials to stop counting votes, including those cast by military servicemen and women serving overseas. In the process, the president took steps to undermine confidence in the integrity of the elections system, as if counting provisional and vote-by-mail ballots is inherently suspicious.This question from Brendan Nyhan rings true for a reason: \u201cThe president is making baseless accusations of fraud and calling for the vote count to be stopped while his political allies are ahead. What would you say if you saw it in another country?\u201d"}
