{"id": "Cleveland Orchestra fires concertmaster, top musician after sex harassment investigation", "paragraph": "The Cleveland Orchestra fired William Preucil, its concertmaster of 23 years, and Massimo La Rosa, its principal trombonist, after a three-month investigation concluded that both men engaged in sexual misconduct.The investigation, conducted by the New York law firm Debevoise and Plimpton, was launched in August in the wake of a Washington Post article that reported allegations about Preucil and two other classical musicians. Preucil had been suspended from the orchestra since the article appeared; La Rosa was suspended in September. Investigators spoke to more than 70 people, including current and former orchestra members, leadership and staff, and musicians outside the orchestra.[Classical music is rife with harassment, say dozens of artists]The investigators\u2019 report, released Wednesday, stated that 11 women had told credible stories of sexual misconduct by Preucil, 60, that took place between 1996 and 2007. The youngest woman was 17 at the time of the alleged abuse. Preucil\u2019s behavior included requesting sexual favors as payment for lessons, exposing himself, and in one case \u201cengaging in sexual activity with a junior female colleague who was too afraid to stop the encounter due to Preucil\u2019s forcible conduct and position of authority,\u201d according to the report.[Read the full 12-page report]Seven women described sexual misconduct by La Rosa, 43, between 2010 and 2012, including inappropriate touching over and under their clothes, and partially removing students\u2019 clothing, or his own, during lessons.\u201cThe investigators found that Mr. Preucil and Mr. La Rosa engaged in sexual misconduct and sexually harassing behavior with multiple female students and colleagues over a period of years while employed by the Orchestra,\u201d the orchestra said in a statement. \u201cMoreover, the abusive conduct by both performers was made possible by their positions of power within the Orchestra and in the broader world of classical music. According to the investigation, women who were victims were intimidated by Mr. Preucil and Mr. La Rosa, and were afraid to take action after they were subjected to the unwelcome behavior.\u201dPreucil admitted to investigators he had had sexual contact with three students, and said that his behavior was wrong. He also admitted to telling a sexually explicit story to a female violinist. But he denied other misconduct.\u201cBased on the number of detailed and consistent reports that Debevoise received .\u2009.\u2009. many of which were corroborated by witnesses,\u201d the report continued, \u201cPreucil\u2019s denial that he engaged in additional misconduct is not credible.\u201dLa Rosa admitted to attempting to kiss a student during a lesson and also admitted that he sometimes touched students, though he said he did so purely for pedagogical purposes. \u201cLa Rosa did not engage in the same behaviors with male students,\u201d said the report.Neither Preucil nor La Rosa responded to requests for comment.\u201cThe numbers are shocking, and it made me sick to my stomach to read the report,\u201d said Andre Gremillet, the orchestra\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201dGremillet apologized for \u201cthe reprehensible behavior of two members\u201d of the orchestra. \u201cI think we have done the right thing by publishing the entire report,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important for us for people to understand how thorough this process has been.\u201dIn The Post\u2019s initial article, which appeared in July, violinist Zeneba Bowers said Preucil assaulted her in his Miami hotel room after a lesson when she was a fellow at the New World Symphony, the country\u2019s leading training orchestra for young professionals, in 1998. Other musicians confirmed Preucil\u2019s reputation for inappropriate advances. Earlier this month, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported two women made additional allegations against Preucil, including another former fellow of the New World Symphony who said he assaulted her in a Miami hotel room in 2005.\u201cI would like to thank the other women who came forward, whose courage and fortitude has truly impressed me,\u201d Bowers told The Post on Wednesday. \u201cI thank the Cleveland Orchestra for conducting a thorough investigation. I hope that this will help begin to change this aspect of the working environment in the music business and in our society at large.\u201dThe concertmaster is generally considered the leader of the musicians of the orchestra, second to the conductor, and tends to be the highest paid. Preucil was widely held to be one of the best concertmasters in the country.Two other high-profile musicians accused of harassment in The Post\u2019s article had already lost their positions. In August, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam cut ties with its chief conductor, Daneile Gatti, whom two women in The Post\u2019s article accused of misconduct. Also in August, Bernard Uzan, the stage director and artists\u2019 manager, resigned as co-director of the young-artist program at the Florida Grand Opera; turned over control of his agency to his daughter, Vanessa; and announced he was leaving the opera field. Four women in The Post article accused Uzan of sexually harassing behavior, including inappropriate language, propositions and groping.[Leading orchestra dismisses conductor Gatti after harassment allegations]Cleveland Orchestra officials said they were not aware of the allegations against Preucil that The Post reported. \u201cDebevoise found no evidence that anyone in Orchestra management knew about specific instances of Preucil\u2019s sexual misconduct other than the allegation that was publicized in 2007 by the Cleveland Scene,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever,\u201d it continued, \u201c former Orchestra leadership should have done more to investigate the reports about Preucil\u2019s behavior.\u201dAs for La Rosa, the report stated that the orchestra was approached about his behavior on at least three occasions, twice by universities. In one case, the orchestra was unable to investigate because the student did not make a formal complaint. La Rosa was issued a warning.Gremillet said the orchestra will improve its whistleblower policy and create an anonymous hotline that will provide a better process for future complaints. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear message that none of this will be tolerated,\u201d he said.But he declined to discuss the report\u2019s conclusion that the orchestra could have done more in the past. \u201cThe report speaks for itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re releasing it.\u201d"}
