{"id": "Halloween slasher icon Michael Myers sat down for an interview with EW. It did not go well...", "paragraph": "Do you know who is a genuinely nice person? Jamie Lee Curtis. The star of the just-released horror sequel Halloween arrived an hour-and-a-half early for her recent EW cover shoot \u2014 which, in famous-person-terms, is the equivalent of getting somewhere before you\u2019re born \u2014 and proceeded to charm all and sundry as the day progressed.But, hey, do you know who isn\u2019t so nice? Michael freakin\u2019 Myers. The masked killer proved a far less winning presence on the shoot and was downright taciturn in the course of my interview with Haddonfield\u2019s most famous agent of death.You can see exactly what I\u2019m talking about \u2014 and what Myers isn\u2019t talking about \u2014 in the video above.Related content:"}
