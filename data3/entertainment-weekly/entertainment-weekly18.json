In Judy Greer\u2018s bedroom in the film, there\u2019s a hat on the wall which was in Laurie\u2019s bedroom in the film, and a few of the props from Jamie\u2019s original bedroom are in there. Just deep cuts!\u201dThe new movie also contains a glimpse of the Halloween masks featured in 1982\u2019s Halloween III: Season of the Witch.\u201cThat was Christoper Nelson, our makeup and effects artist,\u201d says Green. \u201cHe had the idea of just a fun nod to Season of the Witch, which is a frequently dismissed film in the franchise, but we have a certain affection for it.\u201dThe Easter egg about which Green sounds most jazzed is a new version of an ad-libbed song which appeared in Carpenter\u2019s original slasher classic.\u201cThe other really subtle one that I\u2019m really excited about is when the boy and his father are driving, the song on the radio is the song that Jamie sang in the original,\u201d says the director. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t afford the rights to a song for the movie, so John and Jamie freestyled a song: \u2018I wish I had you all alone. Just the two of us.\u2019 And then we had a band write a song as if it was recorded in 1978, kind of a country song, that\u2019s playing in the car. John was just laughing out loud [when he heard it]. He was like, \u2018Wait, that\u2019s familiar. Oh wait, I wrote that song!'\u201dRelated content:"}
