{"id": "The Simpsons: A somewhat complete history of 'Homer\u00b3' from 'Treehouse of Horror VI'", "paragraph": "Every year, come the tricked-out, treat-packed time of Halloween, The Simpsons lets its shriek flag fly with \u201cTreehouse of Horror.\u201d These typically terrific terror trilogies allow the animated family comedy to unshackle from canonical chains and go full-gore with its parodies and parables (R.I.P., every Simpson family member, many times). But on Oct. 29, 1995, following the \u201cAttack of the Fifty Foot Eyesores\u201d and \u201cNightmare on Evergreen Terrace\u201d segments from \u201cTreehouse of Horror VI,\u201d things went from ghastly and harrowing to\u2026 well, extremely trippy and unsettling.The formidable undertaking titled \u201cHomer\u00b3\u201d (referred to as \u201cHomer Cubed\u201d or \u201cHomer 3-D\u201d or \u201c3-D Homer\u201d) sent the Simpson patriarch into new dimensions via CGI magic, which may look amusingly outmoded now but was rather stunning and visually innovative at the time. In this parody of The Twilight Zone episode \u201cLittle Girl Lost\u201d that also riffed on the burgeoning state of computer animation, Homer discovers a \u201cmystery wall\u201d behind the bookcase and passes through the portal to enter a freaky new dimension that looks like what would happen if\u00a0Tron and Battlezone had sex on Good Will Hunting\u2019s chalkboard. Discombobulated yet intrigued by these environs \u2014 as well as his more fully formed body \u2014 Homer\u2019s mouth leaks a beautiful drop of drool as he marvels at fish in a pool (\u201cMmmm, unprocessed fish sticks\u201d). His new-world trance is broken when a cone (Shapes! They are the future!) pokes him in the derriere, prompting him to angrily fling it away, but the cone punctures the gridded ground, creating a black hole. When Bart tries to rescue him from this math-y techscape, Homer falls into the black hole \u2014 and into our real-world realm \u2014 bringing us the first live-action Simpsons moment: CG Homer pulls himself out of the trash and walks down an L.A. street in fear and disorientation. Suddenly, though, an erotic cake store captures his interest, and he wanders in as the credits roll, thus concluding an utterly bizarro adventure into the outer limits of 1995 technology. (And one whose triumph of tech was somewhat trumped a month later with Pixar\u2019s release of the first CGI feature-length movie,\u00a0Toy Story.)\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rank this as the funniest thing that I\u2019ve written, because that wasn\u2019t entirely the goal,\u201d says David X. Cohen, a former Simpsons producer who penned the segment. \u201cIt was the most ambitious episode I\u2019ve worked on, requiring the most people to suffer the most to get it on the air\u2026. I believe at the time that we ourselves were so dazzled by the graphics that we just wanted to linger on them with a little bit of suspenseful music and just kind of show off. We slowed down a little bit just to say, \u2018Hey, world, we\u2019re doing this thing that no one else can do right now!\u2019\u201dOffers David Mirkin, longtime\u00a0Simpsons\u00a0producer who directed the live-action portion of Homer\u00b3:\u00a0\u201cPeople loved it back then because it was having fun with technology at the moment, and now it looks like a piece of history, of being amazed at technology that\u2019s no longer amazing. So, it works funny in both ways.\u201d\u00a0 Adds Simpsons director and producer David Silverman: \u201cIt hadn\u2019t really been done \u2014 certainly not for TV. It\u2019s very hard to explain it to people. It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you know, my friend, you kinda had to be there\u2026\u2019\u201dOn the eve of \u201cTreehouse of Horror XXIX\u201d (Sunday, 8 p.m., Fox), let\u2019s take you back there as best we can, given that we don\u2019t have the time-machine toaster from \u201cTreehouse of Horror V\u201d. Here, several key players in the creation of \u201cHomer\u00b3\u201d rifle through their dumpster of notes and unearth a few ideas that never made it to the screen \u2014 and share assorted tales with EW about the segment that stands as one of the most outlandish and colorful moments in the show\u2019s 30-season run.The genesis of the idea traces back to Bill Oakley, who was serving as co-showrunner of The Simpsons\u00a0with Josh Weinstein at the time. He remembers a lightbulb illuminating over his head while leafing through a Twilight Zone companion book that was lying around the office. \u201cI found \u2018Little Girl Lost,\u2019 and\u00a0I somehow made the connection: \u2018Hey, what if we pretended that the Simpsons were in the second dimension and they went into the third dimension?\u2019\u201d he recalls. Initially, Oakley and his fellow writers were planning to have the characters embark on a journey through all sorts of animation formats, but that notion didn\u2019t last long. \u201cWe were like, \u2018What \u2028can we really do besides paper cutouts?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2028 could do claymation, but that was third dimension [too]. Also, it dilutes the conceptual purity of going from second \u2028to third dimension. In The Twilight Zone, a little girl goes into the fourth dimension. So we said, \u2018Let\u2019s dispose of all that other crud.\u2019\u201dOakley tapped Cohen (who would go on to co-develop Futurama\u00a0with Simpsons creator Matt Groening) to write this segment based on his impressive academic pedigree. (Cohen boasts a physics degree from Harvard and a computer science degree from UC Berkeley.)\u00a0\u201cBecause they were setting it in 3-D, Bill thought it might be cool to put some mathematical jokes in the background,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I came in. Of the many nerds on the Simpsons staff, I was the one with the particular math and science bent to of my nerdiness. So it was up to me to write it.\u201d (More on that nerdiness in a bit.)Pacific Data Images, a computer animation production company that had worked a bit on Batman Forever and Terminator 2 \u2014 and did the digital rendering of the Pillsbury Doughboy in commercials \u2014 was looking to extend its reach into Hollywood at the time. So when the Simpsons producers contacted the company about producing the segment, there was elation\u2026 followed by hesitation. \u201cThe opportunity to work with arguably one of the greatest television series of all time \u2014 one of the best-written, with the most characters \u2014 was what you were dreaming to do in those primitive days of computer animation,\u201d recalls Tim Johnson, the head of PDI\u2019s character animation group who directed and oversaw all the cutting-edge CG imagery in that segment. \u201cWe turned to [PDI founder] Carl Rosendahl and we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the good news: The Simpsons has this amazing script, and we can participate.\u2019 Carl just got up out of his chair and paced the room \u2014 he was so excited. I said, \u2018Well, here\u2019s the bad news: They don\u2019t have any money to pay for it.\u2019 So Carl sat back down and ran the numbers. [The Simpsons] wrote us a check for something embarrassing \u2014 like $6,000 \u2014 and we got to work on it.\u201dLongtime Simpsons director Bob Anderson, who helmed the segment and created the concept art as well as the storyboards while working at Film Roman (the Simpsons\u2018 production company at the time), recalls bringing a small poster card to an early meeting with PDI (as seen below). \u201cOn this small piece of illustration board, I adhered a sheet of black construction paper,\u201d he says. \u201cI ruled some perspective lines for a grid with a Wite-Out pen, which I later shaded with a green highlighter. After masking that off, a toothbrush and a little more Wite-Out helped to create a splattering of stars for the dark, black sky. Two color-penciled, textured shapes set up the neighborhood for the smallest of details \u2014 a tiny representation of Homer trapped in his 3-D environment.\u201d The grid was even more detailed than can be seen in the photo here. \u201cWithin each square of the grid is another smaller grid. Within each square of that smaller grid would be another tiny grid, and so on,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cEveryone seemed to like that, so that\u2019s the direction it took.\u201dPDI was supplied with two layouts: one that indicated what each background shot should look like, and another that illustrated Homer\u2019s acting. \u201cI remember thinking I would break all the barriers that pretty much confined us to our traditional animation, being that we could rotate the camera around Homer as he\u2019s walking because he\u2019d be in 3-D,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was an initial shot where we actually pull out away from him and spin all the way around him and see his entire environment\u2026. Everything was pretty well figured out, and they rendered everything pretty much exactly as I had hoped it would come out.\u201dCohen recalls that, given the project\u2019s ambition and tight deadlines, \u201cThere was a discussion of, \u2018Can we use any pre-existing 3-D models that the company already had to save time and money?\u2019\u201d Indeed, Johnson took advantage of the models and simulations that PDI had been creating over the years.\u00a0\u201cI came at it with the improv comedian\u2019s mantra of, \u2018Yes,\u00a0and,\u2019\u201d he sums up. \u201cThey would have these funny ideas, and I would say, \u2018Yes, and\u2026 did you realize that a teapot \u2014 which is really easy to make, and we already have \u2014 is an icon of computer animation? Maybe we could steer away from that crazy, impossible thing, and also have our cake and eat it too, by being a little truer to that kind of in-joke and mocking the state of computer animation.\u2019\u201dTake, for example, Homer\u2019s \u201cMmmm, unprocessed fish sticks\u201d line. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Well, we know water\u2019s expensive,\u2019 but somebody on our team had just done a really interesting water simulation,\u201d continues Johnson. \u201cAnd I believe we were able to offer the shot of Homer\u2019s glistening drool falling in the water, creating gorgeous sine-wave ripples. That was our big production-value-add to their fish sticks joke.\u201d (Speaking of that water scene, \u201cI got some good notes from Brad Bird [who] at the time was our storyboard consultant,\u201d says Anderson of the future director of The Incredibles. \u201cLooking up from inside the little pond with the goldfish and seeing Homer through the water \u2014 that was one of Brad\u2019s shots.\u201d)Like Anderson, Johnson recalls pouring long hours into the segment. \u201cI was still animating a Pillsbury Doughboy commercial, and we were doing that in the day, but listen, there\u2019s not a single bad memory involved with that,\u201d he says. \u201cThose nights and weekends spent on the show were done with absolute glee.\u201d (The nearly gratis work \u2014 a value that Johnson conservatively estimates at many hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 proved to be a smart investment, as the segment served as a calling card for the company. Shortly thereafter, Dreamworks bought a significant share of PDI, and Johnson would proceed to co-direct Antz;\u00a0PDI co-produced Antz as well as Shrek. )As mentioned, Cohen was asked by Oakley to geek out by slipping all sorts of numbers and formulas in the techno-scape, which also included a Myst temple reference. (You may have noticed that the number 734 spells out PDI on a phone keypad, while a different set of numbers and letters above Homer translate in ASCII code to \u201cFrink rules,\u201d a reference to Professor Frink.) Cohen\u2019s original notes for the segment included this line:\u00a0\u201cIn the background, several equations are floating around that will shock and amuse the scientific community.\u201d To achieve that purpose, Cohen says he planted a physics equation which indicates that \u201cthe universe is\u00a0going to one day collapse in on itself, and that was to represent the fact that the 3-D world collapses in on itself at the end.\u201d (This question remained open to physicists at the time, although \u201castronomers now believe that our universe will not collapse back in on itself,\u201d Cohen helpfully points out.) Another equation, P = NP, which centers on the most famous unsolved problem in computer science, was \u201ca brazen statement in computer science that says, \u2018Yes, these difficult problems actually have an easy solution \u2014 we just haven\u2019t found it yet.\u2019 That was supposed to represent the idea that we can do these fancy 3-D computer graphics that no one else could on TV at that time.\u201dHis pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, involved\u00a0Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. (Around the time that the episode was being written, Princeton mathematician Andrew Wilde claimed to have a proof, which turned out\u00a0 to be flawed, but he ultimately corrected it just before the episode aired, thus ending a dilemma that had been confounding academics since the 17th century.) \u201cWhat I set to do in the background was to disprove it, contradicting the centuries of work leading up to this monumental math proof equation,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWhereas he was saying there were no numbers that make that equation true, I decided to write a program that would look for numbers that made the equation almost true, and were correct to [enough] decimal places that people who checked on an ordinary hand calculator would find that it seemed to be true. My goal was to outsmart people who had an eight-digit calculator, which was the standard at that time.\u2026 This was in the early years of the internet, so I was able to lurk afterward and see people posting, \u2018What the hell is going on here? This thing seems to disprove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem!\u2019 And that was really one of those career highlights where I was like, \u2018Yes! I screwed with three nerds\u2019 heads!\u2019\u201d (He\u2019d screw with a few more when he reworked his disproof of the theorem in season 10\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\u201d so it could fool the then-standard 10-digit calculators.)By the way, here\u2019s how Johnson recalls that prank of the highest academic order: \u201cDavid Cohen and one of our programmers got to laughing so hard that everybody began to back out of the room, because nobody understood the joke.\u201dNEXT PAGE: Find out how the scene with Homer in the real world was pulled off\u00a0\n\n"}
