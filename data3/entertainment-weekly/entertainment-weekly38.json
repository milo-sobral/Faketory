The first kid sums it up pretty accurately, taking one look at Myers and proclaiming, \u201cthis is spooky.\u201d\u00a0 The next child dropped an expletive before backing up repeating the word \u201cno\u201d over and over. Then, an unafraid girl went in for the hug, before the last young lady took one look at Myers said \u201cNope\u201d and walked right back out again. Can\u2019t say we blame her.Watch the video above and check out Halloween in movie theaters now."}
