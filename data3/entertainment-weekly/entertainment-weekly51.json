{"id": "Why Julia Roberts won't ever join niece Emma on American Horror Story", "paragraph": "Julia Roberts has strong ties to FX\u2019s American Horror Story: her niece Emma Roberts is one of the stars and good friend Ryan Murphy, who directed Julia in Eat Pray Love and The Normal Heart, is one of the co-creators.But the Oscar-winner says it\u2019s not in the cards for her. Explains Roberts, \u201cYou know everybody divides the world into two groups?\u00a0My two groups are people that like to be scared and people who don\u2019t like to be scared.\u00a0The first season of American Horror Story came out and the way that I took my kids to school then, there was a traffic light that I always hit red and there was a poster for American Horror Story right at that traffic light.\u00a0I called Ryan and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to tell you right now \u2014 I don\u2019t think I can watch your show. I can\u2019t support you. I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u2019 He goes, \u2018Lady, you won\u2019t get through the commercial.\u2019 Okay, that\u2019s a good friend. Someone who really knows me and so of course I would never watch that.\u201d\u201cAnd then Emma\u2019s on it and I say, \u2018Emma, sweetheart, I don\u2019t think I can watch this show that you\u2019re in.\u2019 And she goes, \u2018Auntie, I was in this toy box at the end of this bed and they pulled my arm off.\u2019 I go, \u2018Okay. You just have to stop talking. I can\u2019t handle it.\u2019 So that is off the table for me. I don\u2019t watch things like that.\u201dFor more on Julia Roberts, pick up the new issue of\u00a0Entertainment Weekly, or buy your choice of two\u00a0covers\u00a0online:\u00a0Julia in blue\u00a0or\u00a0Julia in black and white.
