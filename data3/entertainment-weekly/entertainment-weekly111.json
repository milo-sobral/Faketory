{"id": "William Goldman, beloved screenwriter of The Princess Bride and All the President's Men, dies at 87", "paragraph": "William Goldman, the Oscar-winning screenwriter behind such classic films as All the President\u2019s Men and The Princess Bride, died at his Manhattan home on Friday, his daughter Jenny Goldman confirmed to the Washington Post. He was 87.Born in Chicago, Ill., in 1931, Goldman started out his writing career as a novelist, writing books like Temple of Gold and Boys and Girls Together in the \u201950s and early \u201960s. But like another iconic writer who died this week, Stan Lee, Goldman\u2019s writing skills eventually found their best outlet in a slightly different format. In his case, it was film.One of his early novels, 1964\u2019s No Way to Treat a Lady, caught the attention of actor Cliff Robertson, who mistook it for a film treatment and asked Goldman to adapt the sci-fi story \u201cFlowers for Algernon\u201d for the screen. That didn\u2019t work out, but through Robertson Goldman did get his first screenwriting credit on the 1965 spy spoof Masquerade, credited alongside Michael Relph. Goldman followed that up with 1966\u2019s Harper, which starred Paul Newman as a down-on-his-luck private investigator; the opening scene finds the detective waking up hungover in his office drinking day-old coffee, famously establishing his character without any dialogue. The film was a hit and established Goldman as a screenwriting talent at a time when the profession didn\u2019t get much respect. That led right into his next Newman collaboration, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which sent up the seriousness of Westerns, popularized the buddy movie genre, and earned Goldman a then-unheard-of $400,000 commission.On top of the payday, Butch Cassidy earned Goldman his first Oscar, and also launched the superstar career of Robert Redford, who had been cast as Newman\u2019s sardonic sidekick. Years later, after the Watergate scandal had unfolded, Redford purchased the film rights to the Woodward and Bernstein story, and asked Goldman to adapt it. All the President\u2019s Men won Goldman another Oscar, but disagreements about how to tackle the story (Redford saw the Watergate break-in as a serious subversion of democracy, while Goldman wanted to highlight the bumbling nature of the burglars, as well as Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s own missteps) made for an unhappy production.Even as he became a famous and celebrated screenwriter, Goldman didn\u2019t stop writing books. In the early \u201970s, he asked his young daughters what his next story should be about. As he later recounted to EW, \u201cOne of them said \u2018a princess\u2019 and the other one said \u2018a bride.'\u201d He simply combined the two into The Princess Bride, and later wrote the screenplay for Rob Reiner\u2019s 1987 film adaptation. Like Butch Cassidy and Goldman\u2019s other films, The Princess Bride contained many amazing lines that would later entrench themselves in the pop culture lexicon, from \u201cnever turn your back on a Sicilian when DEATH is on the line\u201d to \u201cmy name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\u201dOn top of his novels and screenplays, which also included an adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s novel The Stepford Wives and the 1990 Stephen King adaptation Misery starring Kathy Bates, Goldman also wrote reported books about sports (Wait Till Next Year) and theater (The Season: A Candid\u00a0Look at Broadway). He even became a bit of a playwright himself when he adapted his own Misery screenplay into a 2015 Broadway production of the story about a novelist held hostage by a psychotic fan, starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf on the stage. Goldman also put his screenwriting expertise to use helping others over the years, working as an uncredited script doctor on films like Good Will Hunting.Of all his often-quoted lines and writings, though, no Goldman line may be more quoted in Hollywood than a truism included in his 1983 memoir,\u00a0Adventures in the Screen Trade: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dRelated content:"}
