{"id": "Halloween director David Gordon Green names his all-time favorite horror movie", "paragraph": "On Friday, we revealed that the favorite horror movies of director John Carpenter, the man who brought us 1978\u2019s slasher classic Halloween, are 1951\u2019s The Thing from Another World and 1958\u2019s The Fly. But what does David Gordon Green, who directed the just-released sequel Halloween, regard as the best-ever creep-out? The answer is Charles Laughton\u2019s 1955 film The Night of the Hunter, in which the great Robert Mitchum plays a preacher-cum-serial killer named Reverend Harry Powell.\u201cNight of the Hunter is the film from my youth that really opened the door,\u201d says Green. \u201cThat was a stepping stone into the more gratuitous genre horror. I guess you\u2019d probably call it more of a thriller, but that was a movie that really affected me in terms of everything from the music and songs Robert Mitchum\u2019s character would sing, and Charles Laughton\u2019s amazing camerawork. It got under my skin, it really disturbed me as a kid, and then I used that as a stepping stone into more obvious genre work. I mean, Halloween was shortly thereafter. The Shining was shortly thereafter. These are the films that I really discovered in the mid-\u201980s when I was probably a little too young to be processing it, and then a little too excited about the disturbing images that were making their way into my subconscious.\u201dWatch the trailer for The Night of the Hunter, above.Related content:"}
