{"id": "Outlander: What to expect from season 4", "paragraph": "After three seasons, a hit show like Outlander is bound to unleash a prima donna. But of all the big personalities on the Starz drama, nobody expected it to be him.While shooting the first episode of the new season, Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser) is doing multiple takes where he sings a Gaelic dirge in a dark and sweltering pub.\u00a0But it\u2019s not the star\u2019s more-than-adequate crooning that is prompting the starts and stops. It\u2019s the presence of a Northern Inuit puppy that plays Rollo, a half-wolf companion of Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell) that\u2019s supposed to play a big role in the coming season (premiering Nov. 4 at 8 p.m.). Just when Heughan strikes a perfect tone with his lament, the dog ambles off camera.\u201cHe was a bit of a diva,\u201d admits Bell after shooting the scene last October. \u201cHe ended up getting cut out of a lot of scenes. The bloopers are quite funny. It\u2019s me constantly going, \u2018Rollo, Rollo,\u2019 and he\u2019s just completely walking in the wrong direction.\u201dWell, they are supposed to be in the land of the free, right? After a storm swept their ship from the Caribbean coast to a Georgia beach in the season 3 finale, Scottish Highlander Jamie and his time-traveling surgeon wife, Claire (Caitriona Balfe), shake off their sandy clothes and, along with Ian and their brood, make their way to Wilmington, N.C. Say goodbye to the kilts and castles, lassies. They\u2019re in America now! \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for a new beginning, a fresh start,\u201d explains Balfe, 39. \u201cOf course there are trials and tribulations. But overall I would say it\u2019s much more hopeful this season.\u201dLast winter, an amusing behind-the-scenes photo of Heughan on location in Scotland went viral because the photogenic star was bundled up in a heavy coat with his face barely visible. For someone who\u2019s appearing in an adaptation of Drums of Autumn\u2014the fourth book in Diana Gabaldon\u2019s best-selling series on which the upcoming season is based\u2014nothing about the picture screams scarecrows and pumpkin spice. It was a fair jeelit ootside, Sassenachs! (That\u2019s hometown yammer for cold as hell.) But at least the snow provided \u201cgood texture,\u201d reasons Heughan, since the woodland glens of Scotland needed to double for the equally wintry Blue Ridge Mountains this season. \u201cIt was all about establishing ourselves in this untouched wilderness,\u201d adds the actor. \u201cIt was kind of fun to be a part of that and to see their settlement slowly grow from being the clearing in the forest to having an actual building.\u201d \u00a0He\u2019s talking about Fraser\u2019s Ridge, the couple\u2019s rustic homestead that sets the stage for the rest of the series. And yes, the studio that helps produce the series for Starz has every intention of adapting Gabaldon\u2019s entire series of Outlander books for the premium-cable outlet. Though the drama has been renewed only\u00a0through season 6\u2014a feat in itself because networks typically like to order shows on a year-by-year basis\u2014Sony, at least, has no expiration date for Claire and Jamie. \u201cEvery discussion I have with Starz is about completion of this book series,\u201d says Chris Parnell, co-president of Sony Pictures Television Studios.First things first: letting the Frasers experience the American dream. The couple\u2014together with their adopted son, Fergus (C\u00e9sar Domboy), and his new wife, Marsali (the delightful Lauren Lyle)\u2014have barely arrived in Wilmington when they encounter their first obstacle, an acquaintance who ends up assaulting Jamie while robbing Claire of a cherished memento. If you liked how the producers used a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall\u201d to dramatize the Jamie/Willie plotline last season, you\u2019ll love how executive producers Matthew B. Roberts and Toni Graphia score the attack at the end of the premiere. \u201cThe title of the episode is \u2018America the Beautiful,\u2019\u2009\u201d hints Roberts. \u201cYou can only imagine seeing this new world, then what happens to them once they get here. It\u2019s actually horrific.\u201dNow penniless, Jamie, Claire, and Ian travel by raft to the home of Aunt Jocasta Cameron (Maria Doyle Kennedy), a wealthy Southern widow with a butler named Ulysses (Colin McFarlane) and a plantation full of slaves to farm her crops. \u201cClaire\u2019s wary of her,\u201d explains Balfe. \u201cThey never really get to get past that rift because of the slaves.\u201d That drives the couple and Ian out into the wilderness, where they encounter a ghost, a racist German, and a very peculiar bear. There\u2019s also a population of Mohawks and Cherokee\u2014a significant subplot in Drums of Autumn that certainly ratchet up the action this season (along with the overall budget). Their costumes alone were a huge challenge for designer Terry Dresbach, who\u2019s just as recognizable to fans as Heughan and Balfe themselves. (She\u2019s also married to executive producer Ronald D. Moore, who helped launch the series on Starz.) \u201cIt was like dressing the Scottish Highlanders,\u201d recalls Dresbach, who loves to engage fans on Twitter about the history of her costumes. (She also has a lively personal account that likes to riff on Donald Trump, but we digress.) \u201cYou\u2019re talking about two groups of people whose culture was wiped out. At a certain point, you have to take all the research that\u2019s available to you and jump.\u201d\u00a0To depict the Native Americans whom Claire, Jamie, and Ian encounter and ultimately befriend, production cast, flew in,\u00a0 and housed roughly 200 indigenous extras from Canada to portray the inhabitants of a Mohawk village, which was constructed in a public park in Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d recalls Roberts. \u201cScotland has a right to roam, so we couldn\u2019t actually close the park. You can only ask people to wait while we film. It\u2019s an authentic Mohawk village that\u2019s populated with people in costume. I remember a few dog walkers coming around the bend on a trail. They looked around like, \u2018Wait a minute, what just happened?\u2019 It\u2019s almost like they touched the stones and went through time.\u201dThat is the point of Outlander, after all. One of the biggest questions in the coming season is whether the Boston-based Brianna Randall (Sophie Skelton)\u2014the headstrong daughter of Jamie and Claire who was raised in the 20th century by her mom and her mom\u2019s first husband, Frank\u2014will travel back in time to meet the dad she never knew. A season 4 trailer seems to suggest the inevitable; there\u2019s a quick flash of Brianna at the Craigh na Dun stones wearing period clothes and a determined expression. But the writers don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise for their growing number of non-book-reading viewers, assuming she even makes the trip anyway. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s just looking at the stones,\u201d teases Richard Rankin, who plays Roger Wakefield, a Scottish historian who falls hard for Brianna. \u201cShe might just be hanging out!\u201d \u00a0Or maybe she\u2019s paying close attention to the research Roger did on her parents\u2019 whereabouts. His digging made it possible for Claire to return to Jamie last season, but it also has an adverse effect on Roger\u2019s budding romance with Brianna. It certainly does nothing for their sex life. \u201cAs much as it\u2019s pulled them together, it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s pushed them apart,\u201d explains Skelton. \u201cBrianna just needs to separate herself and stand on her own two feet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to beef up.\u201d That\u2019s Heughan speaking recently about his already rigorous workout regimen from the South Africa set of Bloodshot, his latest movie, in which he stars opposite Vin Diesel. (When asked if he could take the Fast & Furious actor, Heughan quips, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d) So much has happened to the Outlander family this year that has nothing to do with the actual plot: Heughan became an action star by appearing in The Spy Who Dumped Me; Balfe booked a big role in Ford v. Ferrari with Christian Bale and got engaged; Moore launched the sci-fi anthology Philip K. Dick\u2019s Electric Dreams on Amazon; and Dresbach announced she was leaving the series. But the fans never stop talking about their favorite show (which typically airs only 13 weeks a year), posting memes year-round on social media and tagging the cast, who are intensely aware of their audience\u2019s undying devotion.\u201cThere\u2019s no escaping Outlander, as hard as you might try,\u201d marvels Rankin, who went off to appear on the British series Midsomer Murders after he wrapped the Starz show. \u201cI\u2019m going to feel like this has taken over my life, but it kind of already happened.\u201d Adds Heughan: \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy to think that we\u2019ve been doing this for so long now. When you get the opportunities to go do other stuff, it\u2019s nice. But it also makes you realize what you have and how lucky you are. We were overjoyed they gave us two more seasons, and it feels like there\u2019s a new life this season. It\u2019s going to be refreshing and good for us all.\u201d\u00a0Welcome to the New World.The season 4 premiere of Outlander airs at 9 p.m. ET Sunday, Nov. 4, on Starz. And we\u2019ve only just begun to focus on the Frasers! Join us for another season of Outlander Live! on EW Radio, Sirius XM 105, this Monday at 1 p.m. ET.Related:\u00a0"}
