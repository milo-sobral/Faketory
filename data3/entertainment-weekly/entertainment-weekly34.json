Well, I was wrong and I am sorry.\u00a0One of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view. Sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learnt.\u00a0I learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume, Halloween or otherwise.\u201d\"I want to begin with two words, I'm sorry..The country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense. I believe this is a time for more understanding, more love, more sensitivity and honor..Thank you for listening and for helping me listen too.\" Megyn Kelly pic.twitter.com/6hHrvZLNvK\u2014 Megyn Kelly TODAY (@MegynTODAY) October 24, 2018The segment in question saw Kelly defending Real Housewives of New York star Luann de Lessep\u2019s Diana Ross Halloween costume, saying, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Diana Ross? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day, and I don\u2019t know how that got racist on Halloween.\u201dKelly also stated, \u201cWhat is racist?\u00a0Because truly you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface at Halloween or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween. Back when I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character.\u201dThese statements earned the ire of many on social media, including Top Chef\u2018s Padma Lakshmi, The Daily Show\u2018s Roy Wood Jr., Patton Oswalt, and Kelly\u2019s NBC colleague Seth Meyers.During a segment, Meyers brought out his\u00a0Late Night\u00a0correspondent Amber Ruffin to address the situation.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not racist on Halloween. It\u2019s racist every day,\u201d Ruffin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magical day where you can wear blackface with no repercussions \u2014 unless all of your friends are white, and I\u2019m guessing all of Megyn Kelly\u2019s friends are white.\u201d\u201cI have never been a PC kind of person, but I do understand the value of being sensitive to our history, particularly on race and ethnicity,\u201d Kelly concluded on air Wednesday. \u201cThis past year as been so painful for many people of color. The country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense. I believe this is a time for more understanding, more love, more sensitivity, and honor. And I want to be part of that. Thank you for listening and for helping me listen too.\u201dKelly\u2019s words echoed her previous apology that was sent to coworkers in\u00a0an internal email memo. She wrote, in part, \u201cToday is one of those days where listening carefully to other points of view, including from friends and colleagues, is leading me to rethink my own views.\u201dRelated content:"}
