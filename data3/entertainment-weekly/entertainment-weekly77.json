{"id": "Doom Patrol: Everything we know about DC Universe's next live-action series", "paragraph": "The fourth episode of Titans, the first original series from new streaming platform DC Universe, is titled \u201cDoom Patrol,\u201d and introduces viewers to the superhero team of that name. Doom Patrol will, in fact, be the second live-action series from DC Universe, set to begin sometime next year.Doing Titans first makes a lot of sense, since there have already been two different Teen Titans cartoons for successive generations of superhero fans to grow up with. The Doom Patrol, though, is a little more obscure; they aren\u2019t called the \u201cWorld\u2019s Strangest Heroes\u201d for nothing, after all. So in case you\u2019re unfamiliar, we at EW have put together a guide to this particular superhero team ahead of their TV spotlight next year. This is everything we know about Doom Patrol.While Titans is stacked with young, mostly unknown actors, Doom Patrol casting news has been populated with several big names. Timothy Dalton, for one, is playing team leader Niles Caulder, a.k.a. the Chief. Like Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men, the Chief uses a wheelchair but more than makes up for his physical deficiencies with a wealth of knowledge and a willingness to innovate. Caulder is a leading doctor in medical science and has used his skills to save every other member of the Doom Patrol from certain death at the hands of freak accidents. This casting is actually a big change from the latest Titans episode, where the role was played by Bruno Bichir. Dalton will take over for the proper Doom Patrol series.While Dalton\u2019s Caulder is the leader, Brendan Fraser is playing the team\u2019s most iconic hero: Robotman, a.k.a. Cliff Steele (well, Riley Shanahan physically portrays him inside the robot suit, but Fraser provides the character\u2019s voice and will also play Cliff\u2019s human self in flashbacks). Cliff is a former race-car driver; after he was badly hurt in a crash, Caulder helped transfer his consciousness into a robot body. This is a mixed blessing for Cliff, who often mourns the loss of human faculties like taste and smell in his new form.Matt Bomer is Larry Trainor, a.k.a. Negative Man. A former ace pilot, Larry eventually ran into a force of \u201cnegative energy\u201d and now wraps himself in bandages from head to toe (in a similar situation as Robotman, Matthew Zuk is doing the physical performance under the bandages, while Bomer provides the voice and Larry\u2019s human body in flashbacks). Though we haven\u2019t seen him in action on screen yet, Larry\u2019s powers usually include being able to project a \u201cnegative spirit\u201d out of his body that can fly and perform feats beyond the reach of normal humans. Rounding up the team\u2019s classic lineup is April Bowlby as Rita Farr, a.k.a. Elasti-Woman, a former actress who was opposed to toxic gas, giving her the ability to change her size (the character was actually called Elasti-Girl when she was first created, but obviously The Incredibles owns that name now).Those are the characters who appeared in the \u201cDoom Patrol\u201d episode of Titans (plus Ryan Potter as Gar Logan, a.k.a. Beast Boy, who has now left them for another team). When the actual Doom Patrol series gets going, viewers will be introduced to several other characters as well. Joivan Wade will play Victor Stone, a.k.a. Cyborg, taking over the role from Ray Fisher who played him in the big-screen Justice League. In this show, Cyborg is the one who gives the Doom Patrol an important mission. Diane Guerrero will play Crazy Jane, a woman with 64 distinct personalities \u2014 each of whom has a different superpower! On the villainous side, Alan Tudyk will play Mr. Nobody, a living shadow who can drain the sanity of others.The Doom Patrol characters were co-created by Arnold Drake, Bob Haney, and Bruno Premiani. They first appeared in the comic My Greatest Adventure #80, which came out in June 1963 \u2014 just a few months before Marvel published the first issue of X-Men. That close timing, and the many similarities between concepts \u2014 misfit superheroes led by brilliant thinkers in wheelchairs, facing off against similarly-named supervillains (the Brotherhood of Evil vs. the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) \u2014 led Drake to accuse Stan Lee of ripping off their ideas, though he softened his position a bit before his death in 2007.The Doom Patrol were weird from the get-go, but it took until the \u201980s for them to reach their full potential as the World\u2019s Strangest Heroes. That\u2019s when writer Grant Morrison took over. Morrison\u2019s seminal run on Doom Patrol helped make his name as one of the most innovative and eclectic creators in superhero comics. He shook up the team, introducing new characters like Crazy Jane and taking the whole idea of superheroes in an extremely surrealist direction. In fact, when Mr. Nobody first appeared he was leading a group called the Brotherhood of Dada, and their master plan involved imprisoning the city of Paris inside of a painting.As Morrison himself described the run in his 2011 memoir Supergods, \u201cThe Doom Patrol had always been misunderstood outsiders, so I gave them a new purpose as the only superheroes disturbed enough to deal with the kind of menaces to sanity and reality that not even Superman could hope to confront\u2026Carefully composed pastiches of Thomas De Quincey, Sylvia Plath, Italo Calvino, and F.T. Marinetti jostled for attention alongside fight scenes, wild action, and quotes from avant-garde art or the wilder frontiers of philosophy and the occult.\u201dMorrison\u2019s run is definitely an influence on the Doom Patrol show. At New York Comic Con this year, Fraser previewed the show to the audience of DC\u2019s Titans premiere by reading aloud from Morrison\u2019s introduction to the first collected edition of his run on the comic. Titans executive producer Geoff Johns (who wrote the \u201cDoom Patrol\u201d episode) also told EW that Doom Patrol would be tapping into Morrison\u2019s run to give it a weirder vibe than Titans: \u201cWhen we have more space to do the actual Doom Patrol show, it taps into the even weirder and more bizarre Grant Morrison run. Tonally, it\u2019s different. But even that episode of Titans is a little bit different from the other ones. With Doom Patrol, we\u2019re really tapping into the fun and strange and bizarre of who those characters have always been from the inception. From what Arnold Drake did, to Grant Morrison\u2019s redefining and amazing run, that\u2019s really what that\u2019s tapping into.\u201dNot all of Morrison\u2019s innovations stuck, but his Doom Patrol had a wide influence on superhero stories across the following decades. My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way, for instance, claimed Morrison\u2019s Doom Patrol as a huge influence on his own surreal superhero series\u00a0The Umbrella Academy (soon to be its own live-action series, on Netflix). Eventually, Way closed the circle by writing Doom Patrol himself, starting in 2016. Along with artist Nick Derington, Way even brought back one of Morrison\u2019s wilder characters (a living, moving city block called Danny the Street) and transformed him into Danny the Ambulance. As of now, the comic version of the team consists of The Chief, Robotman, Negative Man, Crazy Jane, Flex Mentallo, and Casey Brinke (herself a manifestation of Danny the Ambulance), though things like membership rosters never stay the same for long when it comes to the Doom Patrol\u2026Doom Patrol is set to hit the DC Universe platform in 2019. As with Titans, Doom Patrol is expected to be released one episode at a time over a matter of weeks. Stay tuned for updates as more information becomes available.Related content:\u00a0"}
