Norman Reedus, who has been battling zombies alongside Lincoln for nine seasons \u2014\u00a0while also engaging in an epic prank war for almost as long \u2014\u00a0has some incredible memories from that final day of filming.From tickling Lincoln\u2019s feet during his final scene to taking in an emotional goodbye speech, Reedus says it was a day to remember, and now the actor brings us up to speed on what actually went down. He also talks about adjusting to LAA (Life After Andy) and the bloody and bizarre souvenir he kept in his trailer to remind him of his missing partner in both crime and grime.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So I was lucky enough to be there for Andrew Lincoln\u2019s last day. Tell me what that was like for you.\nNORMAN REEDUS: In true Andrew Lincoln form, he was spectacular. The very last scene that we shot, he\u2019s supposed to smile. He was supposed to smile, and it was a close-up. So I kept sneaking in and tickling his feet and making him smile on this one line. And I thought it was funny. And he liked it. He kept asking me to keep doing it. So the last scene that he shot on this show, I\u2019m below camera tickling his feet.And then he had some words for the cast and crew, didn\u2019t he?\nYeah, he got up and he gave a little speech to the crew, and asked us to keep the fight going. And this show\u2019s not over. To honor Andy, we still fight the good fight on this show, and try to tell the best stories we can, and give it 1,000 percent in his honor, as well as all the other people that have been on the show. But he asked us to do that. And he believes in us, and he believes in the show, and he believes in the stories. And he was like, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare f\u2014ing slow down one second.\u201dHe got up, and before the speech a lot of people pulled out their cell phones and wanted to record it. And he held up a hand and he said, \u201cEveryone, please put your phones away.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cJust, can you put them down?\u201d He goes, \u201cThis is for us. This is our time. This is our moment here. This isn\u2019t a social media moment, this is for us. This is what we fight for every day, and this is our family.\u201d And I thought that was such a cool thing to do.Everybody understood it, and everybody got it, and it felt so right. And that\u2019s the kinda guy that guy is. He\u2019s not in it for the likes, and he\u2019s not in it for the followers, and he\u2019s not in it for the look-at-me-whatever-I\u2019m-doing. He\u2019s in it for the real stuff, which is why he says he needs to quit the show and be with his kids, \u2019cause he\u2019s been away for almost a decade, you gotta let him do it. That\u2019s real life stuff. And that\u2019s the kinda guy he is. And honestly, I\u2019ll have that guy\u2019s back forever.Was it weird at first after he left and you guys kept rolling? And has it been weird with him not being there?\nDude, it\u2019s been weird as f\u2014, I won\u2019t lie. I still send him scripts. When no one\u2019s looking, I email him scripts, and he gives me notes still to this day. It was weird, I have to tell you.The weirdest part for me was the day after he was gone, and I came to set to work, and it was kind of a quiet day on set. Not because everybody was in mourning, it was just because I wasn\u2019t really working with many people. There wasn\u2019t really many people there. And then we worked in the morning, and it\u2019s all hard work, and then we go out to lunch. And I always take my lunch back to the trailer because it\u2019s so hot outside that I have to have air conditioning or I\u2019m gonna pass out. So I take my lunch back to the trailer, and I\u2019m just kinda sitting there quietly for a good 45 minutes. \u2019Cause I\u2019ve never not had lunch in my trailer with him in nine years. We always get my lunch and go back to my trailer, the two of us. So I just kinda sat there quietly, like, where the f\u2014 is Andy right now?That was the hardest part for me. It\u2019s all healed itself, but I have to say eating lunch by myself in my trailer was really, really weird. It made me really depressed. In my trailer right now, one of the chairs in there is covered in blood and it\u2019s from Andy Lincoln\u2019s last day. He had somebody\u2019s blood all over him, and he left my chair covered in blood. And I still won\u2019t let the cleaning guys clean off that chair, because that bloody chair reminds me of Andy every day. The whole trailer\u2019s really clean except for one chair that\u2019s covered in blood.Make sure to read our account of Lincoln\u2019s last day as well as written tributes from cast-members past and present.
