{"id": "Stephen Colbert knows why Trump shouldn't embrace the word 'nationalist'", "paragraph": "President Donald Trump might claim that he doesn\u2019t know the connotations of embracing the word \u201cnationalist.\u201d Stephen Colbert does.The Late Show host, as well as Seth Meyers on Late Night, tore into Trump for embracing that term during a Texas rally in support of Senator Ted Cruz. \u201cThey have a word. It sort of became old fashioned,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s called a nationalist, and I say, really, we\u2019re not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist\u2026 Use that word.\u201d\u201cYou know why you\u2019re not supposed to use that word? Because it\u2019s the second half of \u2018white nationalists,'\u201d Colbert retorted. \u201cChopping off the first word doesn\u2019t change what it means in our minds. \u2018Oh look, look, I\u2019m a Klux Klan. I have no idea which one. Don\u2019t judge me.\u201dTypically, government officials stick with the word \u201cpatriot\u201d for the reason Colbert laid out, in addition to using \u201cnationalist\u201d to sometimes describe potential foreign threats.\u201cI never heard that theory about being a nationalist,\u201d Trump said in defense of his adoption of the term, according to The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them all. But I\u2019m somebody who loves our country.\u201d He then added, \u201cI am a nationalist. It\u2019s a word that hasn\u2019t been used too much. Some people use it, but I\u2019m very proud. I think it should be brought back.\u201d\u201cWow, so he\u2019s just opening using the word nationalist,\u201d Meyers said on Late Night. Using a Wheel of Fortune graphic with a four-letter word that begins with N, he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that Donald Trump is a Nazi, but I will say, Pat, I\u2019m ready to solve that puzzle.\u201dRelated content:"}
