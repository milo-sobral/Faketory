{"id": "Kerry Washington on her intense, timely new Broadway role", "paragraph": "After finishing her incredible run as Olivia Pope, Kerry Washington was looking to take a break. But then American Son\u00a0\u2014 the breathtaking Broadway drama in which she now stars as a distressed mother \u2014 changed those plans.\u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking to do theater,\u201d she told EW recently. \u201cI did a play on Broadway about nine years ago and one of our producers, Jeffrey Richards, he and I had remained friends through the years and when it was announced that it was going to be Scandal\u2019s final season, he immediately called me and said, \u2018I have three plays I\u2019m gonna send you.\u2019 At that point I had sold Little Fires Everywhere with Reese [Witherspoon] so I knew what I was going to be doing in the spring, and I thought, well maybe I\u2019ll just take seven or eight months off and just relax and recoup from seven seasons of Scandal.\u00a0And then I read American Son, and I was like, nope!\u201d she adds with a laugh. \u201cThere will be no down time. I am going to do this amazing play because I\u2019ve never read anything like it.\u201dWashington, 41, plays Kendra, a psychology professor searching for answers about her missing teenage son. She\u2019s joined by Steven Pasquale (Junk) as Kendra\u2019s estranged husband, and Jeremy Jordan (Newsies, TV\u2019s Supergirl) and Eugene Lee (Gem of the Ocean) as police officers whom the couple implore for information about 18-year-old Jamal. \u201cI felt like I knew these characters, but I\u2019d never seen them, particularly Kendra, before,\u201d says Washington, who made her Broadway debut in 2009 in David Mamet\u2019s memorable fiery drama Race. \u201cI wanted to help bring her to life because I loved the idea of her being a part of our theatrical canon. I wanted her story to be told.\u201d\u201cBefore Scandal,\u201d she added, \u201cI thought of myself and operated in the world as a character actor. I\u2019ve always been drawn to very different kinds of characters. And that\u2019s what my career was before Scandal \u2014 most people didn\u2019t connect that the girl from Save the Last Dance was the same girl from Ray, was the same girl from Last King of Scotland. \u2026 And then Scandal obviously was a different kind of cultural moment and it\u2019s been an honor to play that character for seven seasons, but I really love being able to also play a very different woman in a very different set of circumstances.\u201dWritten by Christopher Demos-Brown and directed by Tony winner Kenny Leon (A Raisin in the Sun), American Son takes place entirely inside a Miami police station in the early hours of the morning and delves into issues like race, identity, class, and police violence. \u201c[The story] is timely, but also I think it\u2019s been part of the historic DNA of what it is to be an African-American mother, just to worry for the safety of your child,\u201d the actress explains. \u201cPart of all mothering is the lack of control over this other human being who, once they\u2019re outside your body, makes their own decisions and has their own dangers. But there\u2019s the added layer of powerlessness as a black mother because of the institutionalized racism and the cultural practices that endanger black children.\u201dAs rehearsals began, Washington \u2014 who is also a producer on Son\u00a0\u2014 says the cast was \u201cpulling our own truths to the table to share with each other, our own beliefs.\u201d (Other notable producers on the play include Washington\u2019s\u00a0Scandal\u00a0creator Shonda Rhimes, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Gabrielle Union-Wade.) Audiences, she hopes, will be inspired to have conversations of their own, which is why the production has partnered with the Opportunity Agenda to create a discussion guide for theatergoers to use after the show. \u201cThe play forces you on an empathetic journey because you\u2019re constantly shifting perspectives, rooting for different characters\u2019 points of view at different times,\u201d Washington says. \u201cI want that empathy to continue in the discourse after the play, but I wanted to give people tools to do that.\u201dAmerican Son opens\u00a0Sunday at New York\u2019s Booth Theater and runs through Jan. 27, 2019.
