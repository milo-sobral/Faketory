Read at your own risk!\u00a0Marvel\u2019s Daredevil\u00a0has outdone itself with its latest hallway fight scene\u2122.In \u201cBlindsided,\u201d season 3\u2019s fourth episode, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) visits a prison to meet with the Albanian gang because he wants to know why Wilson Fisk (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio) sold them out. Unfortunately, he ends up getting more than he bargained for because Fisk, who suspects he\u2019s Daredevil, becomes aware of his presence there and essentially turns the entire prison against Matt. Cue: An extended, 11-and-a-half-minute long fight sequence that was actually shot in one-take (there aren\u2019t any hidden cuts) and follows Cox\u2019s Matt \u2014 who\u2019s still recovering from, you know, having a building collapse on him \u2014 as he punches his way out of the prison, confirming Fisk\u2019s suspicions in the process. Basically, the impressive set pieces look at season 1\u2019s original hallway brawl, says \u201chold my purse,\u201d and proceeds to blow it out of the water, which was exactly the goal when it was pitched to\u00a0showrunner Erik Oleson (Arrow,\u00a0Man in the High Castle).\u201cThe director of the episode, Alex Garcia Lopez, the writer of the episode, Lewaa Nasserdeen, and the stunts team came to me with the crazy idea of doing it as a oner as an homage, and then one-upping of the hallway fight scene in season 1,\u201d Oleson tells EW.Turn around and walk the other way. pic.twitter.com/rdR8XFkGIj\u2014 Daredevil (@Daredevil) October 18, 2018Once Oleson signed off on it, he had the responsibility of then informing the studio that he was giving everyone a day to rehearse the entire sequence before shooting it the next day.\u201cThat was something no one had ever done before at Marvel. It was somewhat agita inducing, but when the crew finally pulled it off, it was something spectacular that injected adrenaline into the crew for the remainder of the season,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really was a team sport. There were dozens of stuntmen involved. There were places where the crew had to quickly hide around a corner while the camera was shooting in a certain direction. Any one person could have messed up this epic oner, so it required every single member of the crew to work in perfect sync. The fact that they pulled it off is just mind-blowing.\u201dThey included some points in the sequence where they could hide a cut if they really had to, but thankfully they didn\u2019t need to, and Oleson took steps to make that clear during the editing process. \u201cWhat I ended up doing in post-production is actually [increasing] the lighting in certain hallway shots so that the audience could see that we never cut the camera, we never actually cheated and did this as a series of cuts made to look like a oner. It is a true oner.\u201dFor Oleson, the amazing stunt is more than just a cool scene; it\u2019s actually an integral part of the story and emblematic of one of the rules he set for the show when he took over as\u00a0showrunner.\u201cWhat I wanted to do with season 3 of\u00a0Daredevil\u00a0is to make the action sequences matter in ways that reflected on characters, or had real stakes,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for the fun spectacle of action sequences, but in a lot of cases, it\u2019s the fun of watching great stunt-work. For me, the best writing is one where the action sequences are an inherent part of the story and you cannot predict that the action is going to turn out a certain way. When an audience knows going in that the hero is going to be\u00a0fine and they\u2019re just going to watch a cool action sequence like a musical number, to me, it\u2019s fun but it stops the story.\u201dIn his mind, the episode 4 scene achieves that goal of reflecting character. \u201cWe\u00a0saw Matt has to cast aside any hope of maintaining his secret identity. He didn\u2019t have the luxury pulling on a cowl. Instead, he had to fight his way out of the prison to survive and knowing the whole time that Wilson Fisk was watching and that he was confirming to Fisk that he and Daredevil were the same person. That scene to me has real stakes just beyond the fight,\u201d says Oleson, who also points to the newsroom brawl in episode 6 as another example of this goal because Matt actually loses. \u201cThere are real consequences to that action sequence. To me, those are the best kind of action sequences in movies and television.The complete third season of Marvel\u2019s Daredevil is available to stream on Netflix now.Related content:\u00a0"}
