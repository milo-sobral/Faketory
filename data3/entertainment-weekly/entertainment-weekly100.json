The voice cast is a who\u2019s who of current comedy greats, like John Mulaney, Maya Rudolph, Fred Armisen, Jordan Peele, Jason Mantzoukas, and Jenny Slate.Season 2 introduced Gina Rodriguez as Gina Alvarez (the first girl in school to grow breasts) and David Thewlis as the Shame Wizard (the Hormone Monster\u2019s mortal enemy).Netflix continues to keep its viewership numbers behind closed doors, but Big Mouth\u00a0maintained positive critical reviews\u00a0across its first two seasons. Season 2 premiered on October 5, so with a renewal coming just over a month later, enough people seem hooked on this no-shame approach to puberty humor.Spoiler warning for bingers, but with the Hormone Monstress now officially overseeing Nick\u2019s development, we can only imagine what shenanigans will ensue \u2014 bloodthirsty pubic hair notwithstanding.Related content:"}
