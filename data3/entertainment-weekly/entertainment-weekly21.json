{"id": "Why quirky aunts are the real winners of Halloween", "paragraph": "These days the Sanderson sisters get all the glory. They\u2019re bold, they\u2019re funny, they\u2019re innovative \u2014 a vacuum cleaner as a broom! \u2014 and their hair is a marvelous feat of engineering (especially for the 1600s, when the field of engineering was all but undeveloped).\u00a0Hocus Pocus is a fan favorite and, as such, so are Winifred, Mary, and Sarah. No one is trying to take that away from them, but it\u2019s high time for some, er, fresh blood to get all the glory.After all, sister witches are all well and good (evil), but our personal favorite Halloween entertainment comes with a slightly different phenomenon: Aunts. Witchy aunts, to be specific.These two (played by the inimitable Cloris Leachman) aren\u2019t just sisters, they\u2019re\u2026twins. The perfect embodiment of good and evil. If you couldn\u2019t tell from the names: Sofia is the good witch, clad in angelic white lace and a Victorian-era\u2026well, everything, and Agatha is the bad witch, decked out head-to-toe in fabric fit for a s\u00e9ance. Their long-standing sibling rivalry drove Agatha to conjure a truly wicked spell, banishing Sofia into the other side of a mirror for what could possibly be all eternity (no spoilers here!).The separation allowed each of them to really lean into the quirky aunt persona \u2014 Sofia because she was clearly bored to tears inside that mirror, and Agatha because, well, witch leaders are quirky! Who has time to stay on the right side of sanity when you\u2019ve got those gatherings to plan?The creators of\u00a0Double, Double Toil and Trouble\u00a0\u2014 which also stars real twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen \u2014 clearly wanted the audience to empathize with Sofia, captive prisoner that she is, but Agatha has some qualities worth chuckling over. Mainly, she\u2019s managed to use her magic powers to topple her own corner of the patriarchy.Practical Magic\u2018s pair of aunts\u00a0\u2014 played by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest \u2014 is quite literally living the dream. They\u2019re holed up in a beautiful historic home in the quaintest seaside town, they have two adorable nieces (Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman), and they eat chocolate cake for breakfast. What\u2019s eccentric about that, you ask?Well, there\u2019s the fact that they\u00a0do\u00a0happen to practice witchcraft and teach it \u2014 semi-subconsciously \u2014 to their young steeds. And then there\u2019s the slight issue of the family curse that kills any man who happens to fall in love with one of the Owens women. Frances and Jet have become a wee bit obsessed. It\u2019s understandable, seeing as the issue is pretty life-altering, but we fear it\u2019s started to take over. Luckily for all involved, their eccentricity\u00a0has contributed to a wicked taste in caftans.The show\u2019s namesake high-schooler is the technical star of the Spellman family, but her magic-making aunts\u00a0Hilda and Zelda (Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick) are the queen of\u00a0our hearts. They\u2019re hilarious, sage, wise, just a dash of evil, and all-around the best guardians a teen witch could ask for. Zelda and Hilda may be, arguably, the least quirky of all the pop culture witch aunts \u2014 they\u2019re actually pretty glamorous \u2014 but let\u2019s not ignore some of their best eccentricities.First, they\u2019re always brewing up potions and accidentally setting them astray. Magic hijinks! Second, they\u2019ve owned both a clock shop (the ultimate locale for the idiosyncratically inclined) and a coffee shop called Bean There, Done That. Zelda is a scientist and a college professor, which couldn\u2019t be a quirkier profession if she tried. Oh, and not to buy into the cat lady conspiracy (there is\u00a0nothing eccentric about a single woman owning a cat!), but Salem, the one that lives at Chez Spellman, talks. That\u2019s weird. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us, we\u2019re off to shop for a few floor-length duster sweaters and a feather boa."}
