Meanwhile, Barry and company faced a frightening new threat on\u00a0The Flash, and Jefferson Pierce paid\u00a0the price for his superheroism on\u00a0Black Lightning.\u00a0Here are the highlights:Supergirl has never been afraid to get political. In season 2, it explored the idea of aliens as minorities, and this season it\u2019s digging even more into that with a story about how anti-alien fear is rising in National City, which is an obvious allegory for our real-world immigration and racial issues. However, the heavy-handedness isn\u2019t a bad thing because the show, at least in its premiere, was pretty nuanced about it. Kara\u2019s optimism and initial unwillingness to believe anything was wrong felt very real and was reminiscent of how many people still think things aren\u2019t as bad in the real-world as they are, and I loved J\u2019onn calling her out for her understandable naivety because she has the benefit of being able to pass as human. \u00a0\u2014Chancellor AgardRelated:\u00a0Read our preview of the entire season with showrunners Jessica Queller and Robert Rovner here, see Elizabeth Tulloch\u2019s debut as Lois Lane in the crossover here, and learn more about Lex Luthor\u2019s introduction here.\u00a0Honestly, I can\u2019t believe it took seven seasons for\u00a0Arrow to give us a naked fight scene. Oliver\u2019s highly anticipated prison shower brawl was hands down the highlight of the twist-filled season 7 premiere. Unlike the show\u2019s usual fights, this one wasn\u2019t just cool; it was brutal, and James Bamford\u2019s direction made you feel every single hit. Plus, I loved how it was paired with Felicity\u2019s own death-match against Diaz. There was something very satisfying about watching Felicity whack the Dragon with a fire poker over and over.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014C.A.\u00a0Related:\u00a0Read our recap here, showrunner Beth Schwartz on the big flash-forward twist\u00a0here, and check out the poster for this year\u2019s crossover \u201cElseworlds\u201d here.In the lead-up to Tuesday\u2019s episode, the cast and producers kept describing season 5 baddie Cicada (Chris Klein) as scary, and it turns out they weren\u2019t lying. Team Flash\u2019s first round with the hooded villain was scary because of how unexpected it was and because they were truly powerless thanks to his mysterious nice. There was a genuine sense of danger here that was missing last season with the Thinker. Plus, the fight led to another interesting mystery: Why did Cicada stop himself from killing Barry when Nora called out? Was it just because he felt bad killing her father in front of her, or was there something else going on there?\u00a0 \u00a0\u2014C.A.Related:\u00a0Read our recap here, and Candice Patton on the importance of Iris as a reporter here.The reason Jefferson Pierce retired as Black Lightning for so many years was that he felt he was doing a better job of serving Freeland residents as principal of Garfield High. That obviously changed last season, when new dangers necessitated a return to costume. Tobias and Khalil\u2019s assault on Garfield High became one of the few times that Black Lightning was the person most fit to protect the school\u2019s students \u2014 and this week, his secret identity paid the price. Since it appears that Jefferson Pierce was absent from Garfield High in its moment of greatest need (even though he was just wearing a mask), the board demanded his resignation as principal. In this week\u2019s episode, he finally gave it. When Jefferson announced the news to students, they responded by reciting his own inspirational mantra back to them \u2014 proving that his teachings have had just as much of an effect on the community as his superhero exploits. Black Lightning focuses a lot on systemic oppression much like the kind experienced by minority communities in real life, which makes touching moments like this feel very powerful and earned.\u2014Christian Holub\u00a0\nRelated:\u00a0Read our recap here.Click below to listen to this week\u2019s\u00a0Superhero Insider, which airs every Friday at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on SiriusXM\u2019s Ch. 105, hosted by\u00a0Kyle Anderson,\u00a0Chancellor Agard, and\u00a0Shirley Li.Supergirl\u00a0airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET,\u00a0Arrow\u00a0airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET,\u00a0The Flash\u00a0airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET, followed by\u00a0Black Lightning\u00a0at 9 p.m. ET. and\u00a0on The CW.Related content:\u00a0"}
