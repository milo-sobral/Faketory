{"id": "Arrowverse stars reveal details about the Trinity-centric 'Elseworlds' crossover", "paragraph": "Yes, this year\u2019s Arrowverse crossover, \u201cElseworlds,\u201d will introduce Batwoman (played by Ruby Rose). Yes, it will also include other iconic DC Comics characters like Superman (Tyler Hoechlin) and Lois Lane (Elizabeth Tulloch), and John Wesley Shipp in a Flash costume. But at the end of the day, the crossover is primarily a topsy-turvy ode to the universe\u2019s main trio: Supergirl (Melissa Benoist), the Flash (Grant Gustin), and Green Arrow (Stephen Amell).And now we can finally reveal what the hell brings the Trinity together!The three-night event begins with Arkham Asylum doc John Deegan (Lost\u2019s Jeremy Davies) rewriting reality, which results in Oliver (Amell) and Barry (Gustin) swapping lives. In this new reality, Oliver Queen looks like Gustin and Barry Allen looks like Amell, and the two heroes are the only ones who know they\u2019re in the wrong lives and have each other\u2019s powers. This not only explains what\u2019s going on in the recent promos, but also why the actors have swapped costumes.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me playing Oliver Queen\u2019s mannerisms, or Stephen playing Barry\u2019s mannerisms. It\u2019s more being aware that for some reason we\u2019ve switched lives and destinies. It\u2019s more the fun of the situational comedy that we keep finding ourselves in, and less us having a complete role reversal,\u201d Gustin tells EW. \u201cWe get to see Stephen do some of the more goofy speed stuff I have to do on a regular basis, and I get some actual combat as Green Arrow. So, we just see different colors for each of us.\u201d\u201cHaving superpowers is crazy! Wearing the Flash suit is crazy!\u201d says Amell, who, like everyone else involved, sounds genuinely thrilled about the crossover\u2019s story. \u201cThe idea is that in order to be the best version of Barry Allen, which I have to be because we face a threat, there are elements of his personality I have to embrace, and there are elements of my personality that he has to embrace.\u201dThe swap is also one of the reasons reason \u201cElseworlds\u201d is funnier than previous crossovers.\u201cMy initial reaction in reading the scripts this year was that it would be a hoot to film. The comedy just lives in this. Even just seeing them in each other\u2019s suits is funny; they\u2019re literally putting themselves in each other\u2019s shoes!\u201d says Benoist, whose character, Kara/ Supergirl, gets pulled in because she\u2019s the only one who can see Barry and Oliver for who they really are (the perks of being from another Earth?). \u201cShe inevitably becomes kind of a middleman because ultimately there\u2019s conflict between the two and they start butting heads.\u201dAdds\u00a0Supergirl co-showrunner Robert Rovner, \u201cShe\u2019s trying to help them navigate what they\u2019re going through and support them and kind of battle their way back to being who they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d\u00a0That dynamic is on full display in a banter-filled scene EW observed in October, in which the three heroes find themselves locked up in Gotham City (as superheroes are wont to do), and it falls on Kara to referee an argument between the two men. Watching the three leads bounce of each other is a thrill, mostly because we rarely get low-stakes scenes like this that are just about Kara, Oliver, and Barry\u2019s dynamic. (We\u2019ve definitely gotten some Oliver-Barry moments like this.)\u201cThe most fun aspect about really focusing on the leads is we really had a chance to tell a story about the troika that we\u2019ve never really been able to do before,\u201d says Arrow\u00a0consulting producer Marc Guggenheim, who oversaw the crossover. \u201cWhen you have\u00a0Legends of Tomorrow part of it, and all of the other secondary and supporting characters, the amount of time we had Grant and Stephen and Melissa on screen together was actually pretty minimal in other crossovers compared to this year.\u201dThe Arrowverse bosses decided not to include\u00a0Legends of Tomorrow\u00a0in \u201cElseworlds\u201d because last year\u2019s Nazi-filled four-part extravaganza, \u201cCrisis on Earth-X,\u201d was ambitious but also extremely difficult, as they had to juggle, well, everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard on the crew, it\u2019s very hard on the cast, and we wanted this year to just be a little easier. That\u2019s why we focused on crossing over mainly the leads of the shows and not including a fourth hour,\u201d says Guggenheim. \u201cThe hard thing about crossing over with\u00a0Legends is, because that\u2019s an ensemble show, you\u2019re crossing over with the entire cast. That said, there is a\u00a0Legends cameo in hour 3.\u201dFurthermore, whereas \u201cCrisis\u201d felt like a four-hour movie, \u201cElseworlds\u201d returns to the episodic format of the earlier crossovers. \u201cI think this year, it feels a lot more like individual [episodes],\u201d says\u00a0The Flash showrunner Todd Helbing. \u201cFlash kind of feels like a Flash episode, Arrow feels like an Arrow episode, Supergirl feels like a Supergirl episode.\u201dAdds Rovner, \u201cIt\u2019s like a three chapters of one story, but they\u2019re all kind of unique to their own show.\u201dEven though it\u2019s relatively smaller, the writers and cast promise it\u2019ll be just as satisfying. Says Gustin, \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s going to be our strongest crossover, our funniest crossover. I don\u2019t know what fans are excited for, but I\u2019m excited just to see Superman, Flash, Supergirl, Green Arrow, and Batwoman all on screen togehter. It\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\u201cElseworlds\u201d begins Sunday, Dec. 9, with\u00a0The Flash\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET; continues Monday, Dec. 10, at 8 p.m. ET with\u00a0Arrow; and concludes the following night at 8 p.m. ET with\u00a0Supergirl.Related content:\u00a0"}
