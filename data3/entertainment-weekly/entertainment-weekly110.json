{"id": "Why Killing Eve star Jodie Comer deserves a Golden Globe (in 5 GIFs)", "paragraph": "It would not be hyperbole to say that Jodie Comer gave one of the most (if not the most) breathtaking performances on TV this year. As Killing Eve\u2018s villainous and wickedly funny assassin Villanelle, Comer created a sociopath who oscillated between absurdly charming and childishly peevish \u2014 but never ceased to be entertaining. Like American Horror Story\u2018s Cody Fern (subject of my previous Golden Globes column), Comer was a relative newcomer to American audiences \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing the Hollywood Foreign Press likes more than a rising star. And like The Americans\u2018 Keri Russell, who my colleague Darren Franich advocated for in his Golden Globes column, Comer was snubbed by the Emmys (though her costar Sandra Oh received a well-deserved nomination). Having already raved about Killing Eve and Comer in my initial review and tribute to the incredible finale, allow me to stop telling and simply show\u00a0the Golden Globes voters why Comer\u2019s performance was so worthy \u2014 via five key GIFs.1. A very sweet entrance (Episode 1, \u201cNice Face\u201d)When we first meet Villanelle, she\u2019s enjoying some dessert at an ice cream parlor. After giving a nearby little girl a kind smile, she exits the shop, and ruins that kid\u2019s day in the nastiest way possible.2. Killer moves (Episode 1, \u201cNice Face\u201d)Did any other actress this year scale a wall while wearing Daisy Dukes and a frilly blouse? I think not.3. The deadest of deadpans (Episode 3, \u201cDon\u2019t I Know You?\u201d)\u00a0One of the many thrilling things about Comer\u2019s performance is how brilliantly she titrated Villanelle\u2019s sarcasm, to the point that it was all but impossible to know whether the beautiful killer meant anything she said or was simply making fools of us all. Did Villanelle really think the Jewish Museum in Berlin was \u201cmassively poignant\u201d? Only she (and her breakfast burrito) know for sure.4. A truly scary work ethic (Episode 6, \u201cTake Me to the Hole!\u201d)She may be a remorseless murderer, but she\u2019s a remorseless murderer who simply loves her job \u2014 even when it means killing someone random simply so she can assassinate her real target.5. Buddy comedy (Episode 8, \u201cGod, I\u2019m Tired\u201d)Here\u2019s hoping that in season 2, Villanelle is forced to spend more time with Konstantin\u2019s daughter Irina (the delightful Yuli Lagodinski), whom she kidnapped in the season finale \u2014 only to discover that the little girl was a master at getting under her skin. Hell, I\u2019d watch a whole Midnight Run-style spinoff with these two. Make it happen, BBC America!The Golden Globes will air Sunday, Jan. 9, 2019, on NBC. Killing Eve is available to stream on BBC America on demand.Related content:"}
