{"id": "How to Get Away With Murder\u00a0finale recap: Why do you look like someone died?", "paragraph": "Here we go, it\u2019s time for the winter finale of How to Get Away with Murder in an episode that will see both the long-awaited Coliver wedding and a bloody, bruising conclusion. Season 5 has been the show\u2019s strongest season since its very first \u2014 a speeding train of revelations and an examination of the corrupt prison system all chugging towards tonight\u2019s explosive finale.We open back where we began with a figure bleeding in the snow. The dripping blood quickly shifts to Gabriel cutting himself while shaving \u2014 Laurel, Bonnie, and Frank look on from their surveillance camera. Laurel wants to tell Michaela the truth about him, but Bonnie says that could put everyone in danger. Frank needs to find out what Gabriel wants and everyone else needs to stay in the dark to keep them safe. Including the audience, apparently.Oliver and Connor are feeling the love the night before their wedding. Oliver\u2019s mom gives a heartfelt speech about how Oliver gives his whole heart to those he loves and how Connor does that in return. Connor\u2019s dad, who came through and paid for the wedding, is there too \u2013 but he can\u2019t make a speech without taking a dig at Connor\u2019s bruised face. A moment only made worse when Connor\u2019s mom pointedly pushes her ex-husband aside to say, \u201cHere\u2019s hoping you have a much happier marriage than we did.\u201d See what you have to look forward to still single children of divorced parents?Laurel returns late and gives Michaela crap for taking Gabriel as her plus-one. Meanwhile, we see the seeds of Asher\u2019s parking lot rendezvous with Connor\u2019s mom planted as he brings her champagne, and she bemoans the end of her hopes that Connor would retire with her to Boca. Oliver continues to avoid Connor\u2019s dad, and Jefferson wants them all to talk it out \u2014 but Connor insists his dad not make Oliver\u2019s special day all about him.Back at Annalise\u2019s new digs, she and Nate are digging through paperwork to take down the governor for Nate Senior\u2019s murder. Nate wants Bonnie to get the name of Miller\u2019s contact who ordered his dad\u2019s transfer. She wants him to ask himself, but he resigned from his job at the DA\u2019s office. Annalise wants them to keep fighting, but not before Bonnie lets it drop that the case and his father\u2019s death has driven Annalise to drink again.Michaela also won\u2019t let this case rest, interrupting Oliver and Connor\u2019s pre-wedding day bliss to make Oliver hack the warden\u2019s phone records. He obliges and she goes to Nate with them. The warden got a call from an unlisted number and then called his chief correctional officer. Nate is infuriated by her interference, but he takes the phone records to a private investigator in a parking garage and asks her to look into them.Annalise is refusing to come to the wedding, so Connor shows up on her doorstep to insist she attend. She complains she\u2019s no good at weddings, even her wedding to Sam was a rush job at the courthouse. She was the other woman and Sam had already had his white wedding. But Connor won\u2019t take no for an answer because if it weren\u2019t for Annalise insisting Connor seduce Oliver and get him to hack records for her, they never would\u2019ve met and fallen in love.Bonnie is getting dressed for the wedding and Frank is going to use the time to search Gabriel\u2019s apartment again. Miller arrives to leave with Bonnie, and she\u2019s surprised he didn\u2019t tell her Nate quit. The two get into an argument and Miller says he feels like he\u2019s in a love triangle with Annalise \u2014 nailed it, bro. He wants to marry Bonnie, but not if she always puts Annalise ahead of him. He insists Annalise takes advantage of her and her \u201cissues.\u201d Which was not, in any way, the right thing to say.Back at the church, Connor and Oliver are getting ready to walk down the aisle. Connor is sweating and freaking out but Michaela reassures him, telling him this marriage will make him a better person. Michaela and Asher share a moment when he fixes her zipper and calls her out on kissing Gabriel, saying he feels like he\u2019s never good enough.But there\u2019s no time to dig into that statement because the music is playing and everyone is walking down the aisle. We see the walk from Connor\u2019s point-of-view as ominous music plays. He is struggling as he takes in all the happy faces greeting him, including Annalise! He makes it to the altar and tells Oliver it\u2019s going to be fun. Bonnie runs in late without Miller and tells Annalise he got called into work.Connor and Oliver exchange vows. And they are perhaps the purest, most good-hearted, beautiful thing this show has ever done. Oliver waxes about his life-long dreams of a white wedding. \u201cMy dream wasn\u2019t the wedding or the tux or Brian Adams, my dream was you,\u201d he tells Connor. And in turn, Connor replies with a speech about Oliver making him want normalcy. \u201cI want to love you until the day I die,\u201d he pledges. Which, on this show, might not actually be all that long. Annalise can\u2019t take all the happiness and love and escapes to the bathroom to drink from a flask, while Connor and Oliver exchange rings.At the reception, Annalise is visibly drunk in her responses to Connor\u2019s parents (though Mr. Walsh totally deserves her attitude). Laurel wants Frank to take out Gabriel tonight so they can use the wedding as an alibi, which sends Bonnie spiraling. Annalise isn\u2019t doing so hot either, sitting alone in the church drinking. Gabriel walks in on her and won\u2019t let her pass. He calls her out on her drinking and makes her drop her purse, revealing her flask. He seems sincere when he tells her his mom waited too long to get help and he doesn\u2019t want Annalise to end up like her. But he\u2019s not being honest, right? At least not based on what Frank finds in his apartment \u2014 a wad of cash, a hidden key, and a case that the key belongs to which contains Gabriel\u2019s birth certificate.Annalise and Nate dance, which tips him off to her drinking. Can\u2019t a lady just have a good time at a wedding?! Michaela wants to know if he found out who called the warden, which comes as news to Bonnie. Nate tells them to keep their mouths shut while he takes a call from his PI who has tracked the unlisted call to the warden to a payphone. She\u2019s sent him an email with more information.Mr. Walsh interrupts Oliver\u2019s lovely dance with his mom to half-apologize, while also insisting he now has to protect Connor from his own worst instincts. And the prize for worst dad of the year goes to\u2026.Oliver ends up stepping out because his dad is video calling him. Meanwhile, Laurel leaves Christopher with Oliver\u2019s mom, and Bonnie continues to freak out.Finally, we have caught up to the real time of the flash-forwards we\u2019ve witnessed all season. Frank is there, showing Annalise the birth certificate and getting slapped. She storms out into the snow. We\u2019re back outside where Christopher is crying and Bonnie is suffocating the unknown victim \u2014 who turns out to be DA Miller, a.k.a. the love of Bonnie\u2019s life. OH. MY. GOD.We flashback to the rest of their conversation in her apartment. Miller continued to rail on Annalise, insisting she is not a good person. Bonnie can\u2019t help but replay conversations with Annalise where her mentor insisted Miller was playing Bonnie. He wants to protect her from Annalise, but Bonnie is putting pieces together remembering he had a friend at the governor\u2019s office. She says he attacked the one person who matters most to her (sigh, Bonnie, you maybe have to let Annalise go at some point) and she doesn\u2019t want him to go to the wedding with her.Back to the wedding, Miller disobeyed Bonnie\u2019s wishes and after looking longingly at an engagement ring in his car, he gets out to confront her. He pledges his love, but she turns on him, insisting he had Nate\u2019s dad killed \u2014 that\u2019s what all the pieces point to. He denies it, but she tells him to never touch her again. He returns to his car but decides to go after Bonnie again and that\u2019s his fatal error \u2014 because there in the parking lot is Nate with the evidence from the PI, a photograph showing that Miller is the one who made the payphone call to the warden that day.Nate and Miller argue, with Nate insisting the inquest was just to cover his tracks and Miller denying all of it. Incensed by his father\u2019s death, Nate flies off the handles and punches Miller in the face, going into an uncontrollable rage and a desire to make Miller feel the pain his father felt. It\u2019s a heart-rending moment, watching Nate unleash on Miller in the exact same fashion that earned his father the prison sentence at the heart of all of this. He beats Miller until he\u2019s a bloody, barely-conscious pulp, and Nate sobs as he realizes what he\u2019s done.Bonnie sees a trail of blood in the snow and just keeps whispering \u201cOh God, no\u201d over and over. She finds Miller\u2019s body and Nate calls out to her from the trees. He tells her Miller called the warden and shows her the photo. Nate is still hysterical, rambling about Miller murdering his dad. It\u2019s too much for Bonnie to bear, but she does what she feels she has to and smothers Miller to death.Everything else is a red herring. Christopher was in the snow because Bonnie got saddled with him when they played Mrs. Hampton\u2019s song; Oliver was missing because he was on the phone with his dad \u2014 though the search for him did lead to Connor discovering his mother in flagrante delicto with Asher. Oliver has been found, and Connor goes in to discover Oliver preparing to make a grand gesture, singing John Legend\u2019s \u201cAll of Me\u201d to Connor in place of a first dance.Conrad Ricamora is an exceedingly talented Broadway performer, and it\u2019s so fantastic to see the show give him this stand-out moment to sing. He has a stellar voice and lends the song a vulnerability and depth that makes the last moments of the finale utterly heartbreaking. Connor looks on, his eyes full of love for his husband, the wedding guests all oblivious to the horrors happening around them.The song and its message of undying love hauntingly plays over Bonnie sobbing through delivering her death blow to Miller. Nate then tries to cover the blood in the snow and stashes Miller\u2019s body in the trunk of his car \u2014 and discovers the engagement ring that was in Miller\u2019s pocket. Bonnie returns inside to find Asher starring wistfully at Michaela during the love song. Bonnie insists nothing is wrong. Laurel is concerned about Gabriel\u2019s whereabouts.Annalise has left the wedding early, having to use a hide-a-key to get into her apartment because she can\u2019t find her own. She\u2019s on the floor of her apartment, crying and drunk, when she hears the floor creak. She couldn\u2019t find her key because Gabriel took it when she dropped her purse. He stands menacingly in her hallway, trying to play it off, but she tells him the jig is up \u2014 she knows who he is. And finally, his identity is revealed. Flashing back to the wedding, Frank tells her Gabriel is Sam\u2019s son. We see the birth certificate and Sam Keating is listed as the father, while Vivian Maddox, Sam\u2019s first wife as it turns out, is the mother. She stares at Gabriel and his enigmatic face shifts to an unsettling close-up on a smiling Sam.And there we have it, Miller is dead and Gabriel is Sam\u2019s child possibly out for revenge against the \u201cother woman\u201d who broke up his family. What do you think? Is Miller truly a bad guy? Or did Nate and Bonnie take down the wrong person? Will Nate tell Bonnie about the engagement ring? What does Gabriel actually want? And is he at all tied to the mysterious adoption that is the governor\u2019s leverage against Annalise? Sound off in the comments or hit me up @themaureenlee.Related content:"}
