{"id": "Hillary Clinton shares her hot take on Vin Diesel vs. Dwayne Johnson", "paragraph": "Stephen Colbert gave some of his staffers on The Late Show the opportunity to ask Hillary Clinton a question \u2014 just one question. One guy, writer John Thibodeaux, had his priorities straight: \u201cThe Rock or Vin Diesel?\u201dDiesel and Dwayne Johnson feuded behind the scenes on The Fate of the Furious, though the two have made efforts to move on from the beef. Johnson doesn\u2019t exactly harbor zero ill will as he goes to make the Hobbs & Shaw spin-off with director David Leitch.Here\u2019s Clinton\u2019s hot take on the matter from Colbert\u2019s comical segment: \u201cWhat a tough question. Boy! The Fast & Furious movies prove that both are masters of high-octane action. And while The Rock is an indispensable part of the later films, Vin Diesel is really the heart at the center of the Toretto family and in the end everyone is better off when they\u2019re able to look past what divides them and work together. You know, I like to say, \u2018Stronger together.'\u201dThe former Secretary of State gave her two cents on a variety of matters, including where one staffer put her keys, the state of the 2020 election, and \u201cthe guy\u201d from \u201cthat thing\u201d a props worker was thinking of. (Turns out it was Tony Shalhoub.)Willie Nelson also popped, but he wasted his one question asking if he could ask a question.Related content:"}
