After 15 years of working in the industry, the actress shared that she had begun to feel disconnected to what she was doing and what was important. \u201cI\u00a0took a year and a half off and through that year and a half I read a lot and really leaned in to my activism,\u201d said the actress, adding that she realized that she needed to pursue art mixed with activism.In order to prep for the role (Moretz plays Cameron, a lesbian teenager who is sent away to a treatment center in a remote area called God\u2019s Promise for conversion therapy), the actress spent time talking to young survivors in New York City who had actually undergone treatment like her character does, including some 24 and 25 years olds who had only recently returned from these centers, having been there since they were 15 years old. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware it was that currently prevalent in America,\u201d said Moretz. \u201cIt lit a new fire under me to dive into it.\u201dDespite being set in 1993, Moretz felt the story was just as relevant and important today. \u201cYou look at our administration\u2026\u201d she began. \u201cWhen we started making this movie, we were still in Obama era\u2026half way through filming this movie Donald Turmp was elected president. Specifically, with conversion therapy, [vice president] Mike Pence has been an avid, outspoken believer in it and has helped funnel money into it, so there\u2019s a massive shift halfway through production and this became, for us, one of the most important things we could be doing.\u201dMoretz went on to share how special her experience was working with a female director and all-female crew on this project. \u201cAll of our heads of departments were all women,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was female. It was really cool. The easiest way to boil it down to a very simple way of describing this is to talk about the sex scenes\u2026For the first time in my career \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing sex scenes since I was about 16 \u2014 we didn\u2019t\u00a0sit down at a table with all the heads and everyone and all the people who make decisions and deliberate over what faces, sounds, shots, what moments we had to get. [Director\u00a0Desiree Akhavan]\u00a0looked at me, looked at the other actress and looked at the D.P. and said, \u2018I\u2019m pretty sure you know what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 and other than that she made everyone disappear.\u201d The actress went on to describe how Akhavan made everyone else on set disappear apart from the D.P. and the two actresses to make it a safe space. \u201d And that goes for how she conducted herself on the entire set,\u201d added Moretz. \u201cIt was this really special experience of trust and respect\u2026and I have to say it\u2019s because of the all-female crew because I\u2019ve never had that before.\u201dThe Miseducation of Cameron Post is out now.Related content:"}
