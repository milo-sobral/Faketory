{"id": "New Aquaman\u00a0photos get up close with armored sea beasts", "paragraph": "Meet the true stars of Aquaman, Willem Dafoe\u2019s giant armored hammerhead shark and Patrick Wilson\u2019s tylosaur.Jason Momoa may be making waves as Arthur Curry in the upcoming DC\u00a0movie, but director James Wan revealed new hi-res images of Dafoe\u2019s Vulko and Wilson\u2019s King Orm riding their steeds through treacherous waters.DC Comics fans saw these mounts in EW\u2019s exclusive concept art from the ancient meeting site called\u00a0The Council of the Kings, just on the outskirts of Atlantis. These stills, however, are our best looks yet at both the sea beasts and Dafoe\u2019s character.Vulko and King Orm on their steeds. #hammerhead #tylosaur #sealife #underwaterkingdom #Aquaman #highres pic.twitter.com/EjPvuM5gHX\u2014 James Wan (@creepypuppet) October 20, 2018Vulko is Arthur\u2019s advisor, while Orm is our hero\u2019s half-brother looking to unite the Seven Kingdoms and lead them in a war against the surface world for polluting the oceans.Based on an interaction between Wan and Wilson on Twitter, it would seem the actor had to ride a mechanical bull of sorts on the film\u2019s set to shoot these scenes before the VFX department worked their magic. As we\u2019ve seen in the trailers, their army of creatures can cause some major destruction.The blue, mechanical bull you sat on?? \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/rCTwoeMfso\u2014 James Wan (@creepypuppet) October 20, 2018Of course I remember. But partly because someone just tweeted it. \ud83d\ude04 https://t.co/dD8VkE4X7v\u2014 James Wan (@creepypuppet) October 20, 2018Aquaman is both an origin story for the sea-dwelling member of the Justice League, as well as an opportunity to make the character more badass after years of jokes at his expense.Arthur, a half-human, half-Atlantian exile, is called back to Atlantis to prevent war. Aided by Mera (Amber Heard), a warrior princess with a telekinetic dominion over water, he travels the earth in search of the ultimate weapon, the Trident of Neptune. With it, Arthur will be able to rule the seven seas.The film doesn\u2019t hit theaters until Dec. 14, but Momoa already has ideas for a sequel.\u201cEven when we were shooting Aquaman, I have the opening of Aquaman 2 ready,\u201d the actor told Syfy Wire. \u201cI went in and pitched it to [producer Peter] Safran, and I pitched it to [Warner Bros. chairman] Toby Emmerich. They loved it. It\u2019s awesome\u2026 But yeah, I have plans for Aquaman 2.\u201dSo far Wonder Woman has been the only one to get an officially green-lit sequel\u00a0off the ground in the DC Extended Universe. We\u2019ll have to see if Aquaman will be another win.Related content:"}
