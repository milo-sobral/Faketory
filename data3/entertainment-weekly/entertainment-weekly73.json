{"id": "Pistol Annies on their new album Interstate Gospel and sticking together: 'We make each other stronger'", "paragraph": "With their fierce \u2014 and fiercely tender \u2014 third album, Interstate Gospel (out now), the force of nature known as country supergroup Pistol Annies has come roaring back to life.Separately, Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley are formidable characters. But when they band together as Pistol Annies, they become a dream country-music Transformer of scorched-earth pathos, wicked wit, and heavenly harmony. Although the women share similarities as songwriters, there is an alchemy at work when Monroe\u2019s soulfulness, Lambert\u2019s feistiness, and Presley\u2019s plainspoken poetics coalesce.That much was clear when the women played the Ryman Auditorium recently to celebrate the album\u2019s release. Their image as mischievous firebrands was on full display in the spirited performances of songs like the giddy, Andrews Sisters-evoking divorce track \u201cGot My Name Changed Back.\u201d But that is only half the group\u2019s story, as they also plumbed emotional depths with the examination of thorny familial relationships in \u201cMilkman.\u201d As each woman took a lead vocal, the other two would often hold hands and sing along off to the side before contributing harmony vocals.In conversation they toggle between praising and ribbing one another, while finishing each other\u2019s thoughts. The sisterhood is clearly strong among the women.\u201cWhen we\u2019re with each other, we make each other stronger and we\u2019re more courageous, and it\u2019s because we can be vulnerable,\u201d says Monroe, who released her sensitive and sensual fourth album, Sparrow, in April. \u201cWe like to show both sides of that.\u201d\u00a0\u201cPlus, we really want to impress each other,\u201d continues Presley, who received critical acclaim for her 2017 sophomore LP, Wrangled. \u201cThe more honest and real we are, the more impressed the other two are. It\u2019s like a contest of who can be the most nitty-gritty sometimes.\u201dThe winners, however, are the fans, who should find something to love with Interstate Gospel, on which the trio take turns singing lead on songs they wrote together. From the girls\u2019-night-out sass of \u201cStop Drop and Roll One\u201d to the Tom Petty-meets-the Bangles vibe of \u201cThe Best Years of My Life,\u201d to the lacerating \u201cWhen I Was His Wife,\u201d the 14 tracks cover a wide swath of emotional \u2014 and musical \u2014 territory.The women never plan a precise time to convene for a Pistol Annies project. It just happens naturally when one of them writes a germ of a song that they know will be better for the group than one of their own solo projects.\u00a0\u201cWe stay in touch, we\u2019re obviously friends outside of work, but sometimes we know it\u2019s time for business,\u201d says Lambert. \u201cWhen we know we all three have something really important to say, we have to go with it.\u201dThis time Lambert, who goes by the nickname Lone Star Annie in the group (Monroe goes by Hippie Annie and Presley as Holler Annie), got the ball rolling with \u201cWhen I Was His Wife.\u201d \u201cI started a verse and chorus and sent it to Ang and Ash on a group text,\u201d she says. \u201cThey both sent back a verse within five minutes and we had our first Annie song for this project.\u201d\u201cI just dropped everything I was doing and joined in,\u201d says Monroe. \u201cWe both got inspired like, \u2018Oh my gosh,'\u201d Presley adds of their collaborative process.Because each artist is pursuing a solo career, they feel little pressure to adhere to industry norms when it comes to the album/tour cycle \u2014 the group\u2019s last record, Annie Up, dropped in 2013, and since forming in 2010 they have had two weddings, a divorce, a baby, and a baby on the way \u2014 or the quest for hit singles.\u201cWe don\u2019t ever think, \u2018What do we need,\u2019\u201d says Presley with regards to a certain number of uptempo songs or ballads dictated by Nashville standards. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that stuff,\u201d says Monroe, \u201cjust which songs are the best and which songs belong on here and which make us feel something.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of Pistol Annies,\u201d says Lambert, who is vying for her eighth Female Vocalist of the Year trophy at this month\u2019s CMA Awards, thanks to her stellar 2016 double LP, The Weight of These Wings. The trio will perform on the ceremony Nov. 14 on ABC. \u00a0\u201cWe started the band out of absolute inspiration and passion, and we have not strayed from that. We\u2019ve made it a mission to keep this organic and just go with our heart and gut on everything.\u201dThere are no current tour plans, given the approaching due date of Presley\u2019s second child, but they\u2019re not ruling out tearing it up live at some point. \u201cWe would love to have some dates,\u201d says Lambert. \u201cWe\u2019re all three doing shows, so we\u2019re going to try as much as we can to perform with Annies. If nothing else, it\u2019s just more fun.\u201dRelated Content:\u00a0"}
