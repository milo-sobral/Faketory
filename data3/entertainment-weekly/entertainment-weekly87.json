{"id": "First Toy Story 4 teaser introduces a reluctant new toy", "paragraph": "The toys are back in town!Disney unveiled the first teaser trailer for Pixar\u2019s Toy Story 4 on Monday morning, giving a look at beloved old friends like Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and Jessie \u2013 plus a new face who seems less than thrilled to be part of the gang.The teaser gives a look inside Bonnie\u2019s room and introduces the newcomer, Forky (voiced by Tony Hale), who\u2019s described as \u201can actual spork-turned-craft project who insists he isn\u2019t a toy.\u201d But every time he tries to get away, he gets pulled into an adventure he\u2019d rather skip.\u201cLike most people, I assumed that Toy Story 3 was the end of the story,\u201d director Josh Cooley said in a statement. \u201cAnd it was the end of Woody\u2019s story with Andy. But just like in life, every ending is a new beginning. Woody now being in a new room, with new toys, and a new kid, was something we have never seen before. The questions of what that would be like became the beginning of an entertaining story worth exploring.\u201dAnd when it comes to Forky, he added, \u201cThe world of Toy Story is built upon the idea that everything in the world has a purpose. A toy\u2019s purpose is to be there for its child. But what about toys that are made out of other objects? Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so he\u2019s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.\u201dHere\u2019s the official synopsis for the film: \u201cWoody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that\u2019s Andy or Bonnie. But when\u00a0Bonnie\u00a0adds\u00a0a reluctant new toy\u00a0called \u2018Forky\u2019 to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends\u00a0will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy.\u201dWatch the footage above to see how his spork-as-toy existential crisis disrupts an otherwise happy moment with the rest of the group, and check out Woody gracing a new poster below.Toy Story 4 opens in theaters on June 21, 2019.Related content:"}
