Why not kneel next to your brothers? Otherwise how are you not complicit?\u201dSchumer\u2019s statement comes following news of Rihanna\u2019s decision to turn down the Super Bowl Halftime Show, reportedly as an act of support for Kaepernick.The San Francisco 49ers quarterback is currently embroiled in a legal battle against the NFL, alleging that they have colluded to keep him off the field as a result of the protest, in which he knelt as a means of calling attention to police brutality against African American men.Schumer not only praises the singer for the move but encourages the members of Maroon 5, who are slated to take the stage during the game next year, to drop out.\u201cI think it would be cool if @maroon5 backed out of super bowl like @badgalriri Did,\u201d she added.She then revealed she wants no part of the annual sporting staple and intends to turn down any commercial appearances associated with it.\u201cI personally told my reps I wouldn\u2019t do a Super Bowl commercial this year,\u201d she posted. \u201cI know it must sound like a privilege ass sacrifice but it\u2019s all i got,\u201d she wrote. Schumer added.The 37-year-old previously appeared in a series of politically charged Bud Light commercials opposite Seth Rogen during the big game in 2016.Over the course of her career, Schumer has been vocal on a number of hot-button issues. She was arrested last month while protesting Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court and frequently speaks out on the subject of gun control \u2013 often referencing the three shooting deaths that occurred during a showing of her film Trainwreck in 2015 at a theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.Schumer called attention to the difficulty of her battle against the NRA in the post, before rallying her followers to take action even if it appears to be in vain.\u201cI know opposing the nfl is like opposing the nra,\u201d she shared. \u201cVery tough, but don\u2019t you want to be proud of how you\u2019re living? Stand up for your brothers and sisters of color.\u201dThe 2019 Super Bowl will be held at Atlanta, Georgia\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3.Related content:\u00a0"}
