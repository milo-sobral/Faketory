{"id": "How M\u00e9lanie Laurent deliberately resisted\u00a0True Detective's legacy in Galveston", "paragraph": "For her stateside directorial debut, French actress and filmmaker M\u00e9lanie Laurent (Inglourious Basterds, Now You See Me) felt she only had one chance to get it right for her first venture into the U.S. market. Thus, she took a creative gamble by adapting\u00a0True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto\u2019s 2010 novel Galveston into a feature on her own terms, deliberately straying from the thematic and aesthetic expectations associated with his wildly popular HBO series. The result, she hoped, was to craft a distinctly foreign take on a quintessentially American crime story set along the coast of southeastern Texas.\u201cThis is the first shot I had in America, making an American movie about an American story as a director from France. [I was afraid of] not making something good enough to be able to make another movie here,\u201d the 35-year-old tells EW. \u201cThe idea was to do something very different. Production-wise and acting-wise, we didn\u2019t want to make anything that looked like a Nic movie.\u201dA filmmaker who works in strokes of impression \u2014 often creating improvised scenes on the fly as dictated by the set\u2019s \u201cmood of the day\u201d \u2014 Laurent strung together multiple creative threads to make\u00a0Galveston, Pizzolatto\u2019s original screenplay for which she\u00a0tweaked and expanded during production. The completed work follows a hard-boiled hitman named Roy (Ben Foster) who, along with fellow target Raquel (Elle Fanning) survives a bloody double-crossing staged by his menacing employer (Beau Bridges). On the run, the pair goes into hiding in the film\u2019s titular town, where Roy plots his revenge as his relationship with Raquel (who\u2019s later revealed to be working as an escort) blossoms into an unlikely friendship instead of wilting under the clich\u00e9d pressures of would-be romantic entanglement.\u201cFor once it\u2019s two people with a platonic love story, a fantastic, beautiful, strong friendship\u2026. I wanted to make sure we wouldn\u2019t go down any other path,\u201d Laurent observes of the odd couple\u2019s magnetic chemistry, a dynamic that ultimately tests (and perhaps softens) the edges of Roy\u2019s violent instincts. \u201cI told Ben and Elle, \u2018You have to feel like you love each other; nothing\u2019s going to happen sexually, but also that you would die for the other one.\u2019\u201dLaurent admits her process changed \u201cthe script and the [story] a little bit\u201d from Pizzolatto\u2019s final draft, though producer Tyler Davidson previously told EW her edits were \u201csignificant\u201d \u2014 enough so that Pizzolatto\u00a0requested his name be removed from the official credits\u00a0in favor of the pseudonym \u201cJim Hammett.\u201d (Pizzolatto did not reply to EW\u2019s request for comment.)\u201cIf [producers] wanted to make an American movie in the spirit of True Detective, I think they\u2019d have chosen someone else. They had a reason to find a female director from Europe,\u201d Laurent explains,\u00a0adding that her favorite extemporized moment sees Fanning crying in a bathtub after a particularly traumatic experience in a scene that doesn\u2019t exist in Pizzolatto\u2019s book, one that she feels effectively communicates her singular artistic spirit.\u201cMy way of working involves feeling my instincts. You shoot a scene, go home, and feel like, okay, I need to change things tomorrow! We need to add another scene [because the actors] did something strong, so we need to follow it,\u201d says Laurent. \u201c[That] added moments of life into the script.\u201dWhile Pizzolatto laid the foundation, Laurent says she \u201cnever met the guy,\u201d so she didn\u2019t feel intimidated tackling his ambitious project. And for the most part, stateside critics have\u00a0generally praised\u00a0her domestic bow in the director\u2019s chair. Having helmed several popular works in her native France, however, Laurent\u00a0has built up a regional reputation of quality after releasing the fantastic 2014 psychological thriller\u00a0Breathe\u00a0and the 2017 drama Diving \u2014 the former of which received two nominations at the C\u00e9sar Awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars. With all of its American trimmings, then, Galveston\u00a0confused homeland viewers.\u201c[French] journalists were like \u2018Oh, wow! It\u2019s an American movie. We can\u2019t tell it\u2019s you!\u2019\u201d she notes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I made an American movie or if you\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s [from] a female director from Europe.\u201dBut Laurent says she\u2019s happy with the movie she made; even if it\u2019s a mystery to others on the surface, it runs thick with her creative DNA.\u201cThe story was really American, the lighting is different from what you\u2019d see in Paris, and the actors work differently in France [but] the way I filmed is the way I film every story. I feel like it\u2019s my movie\u2026. I didn\u2019t [approach it] like, I have to be an American director now,\u201d she finishes. \u201cI never asked myself if I had to watch more True Detective episodes to get in the spirit of it, nor did I have to watch more American movies to [connect with] American viewers. I just made a movie.\u201dGalveston \u2014\u00a0also starring Adepero Oduye\u00a0(12 Years a Slave, Pariah) and Lili Reinhart (Riverdale) \u2014\u00a0is now playing in limited theatrical release and is available on VOD and digital HD.
