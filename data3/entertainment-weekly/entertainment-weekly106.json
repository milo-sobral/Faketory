{"id": "See Superman and Lois Lane on the Kent Farm in new Arrowverse crossover photo", "paragraph": "Welcome home, Smallville!EW is debuting a new image from this year\u2019s \u201cElseworlds\u201d crossover that shows Superman/Clark Kent (Tyler Hoechlin) on the Kent Farm with Lois Lane (Elizabeth Tulloch), who makes her\u00a0Arrowverse debut in the three-night event that includes The Flash, Arrow, and Supergirl. The photo, which you can see below, is an angle from\u00a0Supergirl star Melissa Benoist\u2019s first scene with the pair and was shot on the same farm that\u00a0Smallville used during its 10 season run.\u201cI felt like we should\u2019ve been eating apple pie and waving American flags. It was such Americana, and there were pickup trucks and Lois Lane had a toolbox and was working on a car,\u201d Benoist tells EW. \u201cThat iconic relationship of Lois and Clark, [Tyler and Elizabeth] have just totally embraced it.\u201dCheck out the photo below, and then read on to find out what you can expect from the Man of Steel and Lois Lane in the crossover.The fact that Superman and Lois Lane are even part of the story is pretty unreal because DC Comics tends to reserve those characters for the big screen (Hoechlin has appeared in four episodes of Supergirl). However, when the executive producers and the network had their first crossover meeting last March, Arrowverse mastermind Greg Berlanti had already received permission to use Superman.\u00a0Lois entered the mix once they started breaking the story in what\u00a0Arrow showrunner Beth Schwartz refers to as the Super Writers\u2019 Room, which included Berlanti, EPs and writers, Geoff Johns, and\u00a0Batwoman\u2018s\u00a0Caroline Dries.\u201cWhen we were talking about the story we wanted to send Clark on in the crossover, we were talking about different elements and that\u2019s when we started talking about Lois,\u201d says\u00a0Supergirl\u00a0co-showrunner Robert Rovner. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to bring Lois onto the show. She\u2019s such a great character and we were just excited to be able to have her and she organically fits into the story we were telling in the crossover.\u201dBenoist promises that fans won\u2019t be disappointed by Tulloch\u2019s portrayal of Lois. \u201cShe is such a force to be reckoned with, and Elizabeth is perfect for it,\u201d says Benoist. \u201cThe way they\u2019ve written her in this world, she\u2019s a firebolt and really sassy and awesome. I think people will really respond to her.\u201dSuperman\u2019s place in the story is directly related to where\u00a0Supergirl\u2018s eighth episode of the season. \u201cKara is coming out of the midseason finale at a crossroads, and the journey that she\u2019s on is kind of helped by Clark, who is returning from Argo kind of on his own journey,\u201d says Rovner, adding that the Supergirl\u00a0writers pitched using the\u00a0Smallville farm because \u201cit kind of seemed like the organic place for them to meet\u201d given where the Kryptonians\u2019 heads are at when the crossover begins.\u201cElseworlds\u201d will also mark the first time that the Green Arrow (Stephen Amell) and the Flash (Grant Gustin) share the screen with Superman in the Arrowverse. If you think you\u2019re excited about this, you aren\u2019t alone. Gustin was also freaking out about it when he and Amell took a photo with Hoechlin.\u201cThat was just like genuine, \u2018What are we supposed to do for this photo?\u2019 I was so flustered when I saw him in that thing,\u201d says Gustin, referencing Hoechlin\u2019s black Superman costume. \u201cI hadn\u2019t worked with Tyler at all as Superman, so that was the trippiest thing I\u2019ve experienced so far on the show.\u201d\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/vkqQHTkSGq\u2014 Stephen Amell (@StephenAmell) October 15, 2018\u00a0\u201cElseworlds\u201d begins Sunday, Dec. 9, with\u00a0The Flash\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET; continues Monday, Dec. 10, at 8 p.m. ET with\u00a0Arrow; and concludes the following night at 8 p.m. ET with\u00a0Supergirl.Related content:\u00a0"}
