{"id": "Karyn Kusama, Heather Graham, Polly Draper among female directors talking broken Hollywood culture at SCAD Savannah Film Festival", "paragraph": "On Monday at SCAD Savannah Film Festival, a panel of Wonder Women directors joined EW\u2019s Devan Coggan to discuss their careers to date and share insight into the movie-making industry.The impressive lineup included Heather Graham (who made her directorial debut with\u00a0Half Magic earlier this year),\u00a0Christina Choe (Nancy),\u00a0Polly Draper (Stella\u2019s Last Weekend),\u00a0Debra Granik (Leave No Trace),\u00a0Karyn Kusama, (Destroyer),\u00a0Hannah Marks (After Everything) and\u00a0A.M. Lukas (One Cambodian Family Please for My Pleasure).All of the filmmakers wasted no time getting into a discussion on everything from how they got started (Draper made a home movie called Murder on Draper Lane and cast everyone in her neighborhood in it), their most difficult days on set (Choe recalled discovering an area they wanted to shoot in was rife was Confederate flags so production had to be moved), and the female experience in the largely male-dominated world of filmmaking.Draper shared a story of creating a television series for Nickelodeon and then having to suffer through a call from the Directors Guild making sure she understood that there\u2019s a difference between acting and directing, adding that she questioned the man making the call if he\u2019d ask the same question of a male actor. \u201cThat may be a thing of the past,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be that there are enough actresses that are getting into the business or men are too scared now with #MeToo to ever say something like that now, but that was my experience with joining the Directors Guild. That prejudice is out there.\u201dWhen asked if things have shifted in the last year for women in the industry, Kusama replied: \u201cThings can\u2019t shift in a year. I wish they could, but, personally the Kavanaugh hearings proved to be that almost nothing has changed and if anything the backlash is so much stronger right now that what we as the women sitting up here, and the women and men in this audience right now all have to do is look at this and say, \u2018this is a problem that will threaten our very survival as a species.\u2019 I\u2019ve been asked this question for 20 years and I don\u2019t know what to say other than maybe the moment we\u2019re in is charged enough that you can\u2019t just say completely stupid, completely ignorant things and get away with it anymore.\u201dWhile all the panelists agreed that there was a long way to go in the business \u2014 and in general \u2014 before women were going to find themselves probably represented and given the opportunities they deserve, they also felt optimistic when reflecting on how the last couple of years have united women and seen them come together in united goals.\u201cI do find myself talking about it so much with women and finding these new friends who are making their lives about it, who are starting organizations and having events and it\u2019s just like this love fest,\u201d said Lukas. \u201cThe one thing that maybe has shifted is that we\u2019re all confronting reality now. We are having this powerful relationship with the reality of things rather than thinking, \u2018Okay, I know I\u2019m a woman but I\u2019m going to join that boys\u2019 club, I\u2019m going to be good enough to get in\u2026that\u2019s how it used to be\u2026now I think there\u2019s more of a camaraderie and an understanding that this is something that we should all make sure everybody\u2019s aware of and bring each other up and go for it.\u201dWhen asked what men could do to help there be better representation, Choe replied simply: \u201cHire us.\u201d While Kusama questioned how we can change the culture. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a larger question which is how do we get to a place where men say \u2018I really wanna\u2026work with any of the women up here, not because of some cultural mandate, but because they simply respect the work and think they have something to learn from us which they do. There\u2019s a part of me that wants to say if we simply burrow in and say this is our tribe and only support each other, I wonder if down the line we create some divisions that ultimately we\u2019re trying to get passed. I don\u2019t know the answer to the question but my hope is that some day, we just get to a different level of the conversation.\u201dFirst-time director Graham felt it\u2019s a general respect towards femininity that was needed. \u201cI think masculinity is held up on this pedestal and \u2026 instead of saying our femininity is a beautiful thing we think of it as a bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re in a time where we can be women, and be powerful, and be feminine, and be sexual and enjoy our femininity\u2026Our culture as a whole needs a mass healing to respect femininity in general.\u201dRelated content:"}
