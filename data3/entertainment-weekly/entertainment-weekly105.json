By 2002, she starred opposite Rob Schneider in\u00a0The Hot Chick; in 2003, a role on the television series\u00a0Slings and Arrows\u00a0(pictured) would follow; and then, in 2004, she broke out with two modern-day classics. That year found McAdams starring in\u00a0Mean Girls\u00a0and\u00a0The Notebook\u00a0(the latter opposite her one-time boyfriend Ryan Gosling), and the rest \u2014 as they say \u2014 is so fetch.
