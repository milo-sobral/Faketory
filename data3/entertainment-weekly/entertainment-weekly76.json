{"id": "Jim Cummings reveals secret ingredients to Winnie the Pooh's voice", "paragraph": "\u201cLike a breeze whispering through the cattails.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the sound of leaves skittering across a sidewalk.\u201dThat\u2019s the evocative way actor Jim Cummings describes the creation of Winnie the Pooh\u2019s voice in a new behind-the-scenes video for Christopher Robin.Cummings has been supplying the voice of Pooh-bear since 1987, but he insists it doesn\u2019t belong to him. \u201cI borrowed it from the late, great Sterling Holloway,\u201d he says in the exclusive video above. \u201cInterestingly enough that was just his speaking voice.\u201dHis own natural voice is very different, but he explains where he finds the little chubby bear. \u201cIt\u2019s right between my falsetto and my upper register. Then you just filter in a little bit of sand, and then some whimsy. And there you have it.\u201dAs he speaks, his voice transforms. Magic.Christopher Robin is out on digital and Blu-ray on Nov. 6."}
