{"id": "Mike Judge gets funky in season 2 of Tales From the Tour Bus", "paragraph": "After tackling some of the most hair-raising tales in country music in season 1 of the animated Cinemax series\u00a0Tales From the Tour Bus, creator Mike Judge gets funky in season 2, premiering Nov. 2, chronicling the exploits of George Clinton, James Brown, Rick James, and more.While there were definite similarities between the genres, the funk musicians, Judge says, \u201care slightly more law-abiding \u2014\u00a0there\u2019s not as many fingers getting blown off. But, they\u2019re equally hilarious and interesting. Just like in the country music category, almost all of them come from really humble beginnings.\u201dJudge also feels like these tales were less well-known than some of their twangier counterparts.\u201cI didn\u2019t know a lot of these stories until we did this,\u201d he says of vignettes like Clinton\u2019s mother giving birth to him in an outhouse or the time he accidentally set some fancy hotel room curtains on fire. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that was fun about this for me, just learning all these details.\u201dParticularly illuminating for the creator of Beavis and Butt-Head, Silicon Valley, and writer-director of Office Space, was spending time with Clinton.\u201cHe\u2019s a cartoon character in real life, and it was so fun to actually make him animated,\u201d he says of the leader of Parliament-Funkadelic collective, who served as inspiration for several generations of artists like Prince and whose beats served as the springboard for hundreds of hip-hop songs.George Clinton in Tales from the Tour Bus\u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Judge says of the endlessly colorful, 77-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer. \u201cHe\u2019s got the best vibe of maybe anybody I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s just so positive and hilarious and he helped us out a lot with this, including with the music with [series composer] John Frizzell and him doing some of the score. Mentally, he\u2019s in great shape, too. I mean, we were sitting in the kitchen at the recording studio and he was telling me about these characters [in his stories], and he just spontaneously went into a rap, basically, that rhymed all the way through that was like three minutes long and it was just brilliant.\u201dTales from the Tour Bus creator Mike JudgeAnother highlight for the diehard music fan was bringing in Rick James\u2019 backing group the Stone City Band to actually record some music for the series.\u201cBecause a lot of these [clips] are scenes where they\u2019re just playing on stage, we didn\u2019t want to just get some horrible needle drop or studio musician music,\u201d says Judge. \u201cSo we had those guys play. We did that with Waylon Jennings [last season], too. We had his band play, which was actually awesome. It gave me goosebumps, seeing Richie Albright just start kicking off those drumbeats and it sounds like what I grew up with. And same thing with the Stone City Band.\u201dApparently, they approved. \u201cThey saw a little bit of it when they were in the studio and they were all laughing,\u201d says Judge. \u201cThey all seemed to like it.\u201dIf he were to get a third season, Judge says it will cover \u201ceither the beginning of hip-hop or blues. It\u2019s hard to say, but it would probably be one of those two things.\u201dFor now, fans of the funk can catch season 2 of Tales from the Tour Bus on Cinemax on Fridays at 10 p.m. ET.Related Content:"}
