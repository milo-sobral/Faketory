{"id": "Legacies star Matthew Davis on discovering a 'different side' of Alaric", "paragraph": "Alaric Saltzman has a long, complicated history with Mystic Falls. When he arrived in town in the first season of\u00a0The Vampire Diaries, he was a vampire hunter of sorts who simply wanted answers about his wife\u2019s death. And by the time the show had run through its eight seasons on air, Alaric had fallen in love \u2014 and lost those loved ones \u2014 multiple times. He\u2019d become a surrogate parent to Elena and Jeremy and a drinking buddy to Damon. He\u2019d died\u2026 multiple times. And then there was that time the Gilbert ring turned him into a murderer, which resulted in Esther turning him into an Original vampire.And yet, by the end of the series, Alaric had found his happy place by opening the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted with Caroline so their daughters could grow up in an environment that helped them learn to control their powers. When Legacies kicks off, Alaric is 10 years into running the school, and now he\u2019s got teenage daughters on his hands.EW spoke with star Matthew Davis about how Alaric has changed and what to expect from the latest show in the Vampire Diaries universe.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: As someone who spent eight seasons on\u00a0The Vampire Diaries, what\u2019s it like to be back in Mystic Falls, playing the same character, but on a new show?\nMATTHEW DAVIS: It\u2019s an odd sensation because you walk in and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d but this is totally brand-new and redone in every way. It\u2019s Mystic Falls, it\u2019s Alaric, it\u2019s the Salvatore School, but it\u2019s completely new, and it\u2019s completely fresh and you\u2019ve got a brand-new cast. And we\u2019ve got a whole new engine driving our narrative this show \u2014 it\u2019s giving us an opportunity to create a circumstance where something is drawn to Mystic Falls, a series of these different creatures are coming out of the woodwork, and so we\u2019re put on the defense as we figure out what\u2019s going on. So while there\u2019s a familiarity to everything, it\u2019s totally fresh and very new, and everyone\u2019s really excited about it.The monster-of-the-week format is kind of perfect for Alaric. This is a guy who loves researching creatures and knows how to get in on the action. Is he fully back in fighting mode?\n                I think it is tailor-made for him. You\u2019re going to see a whole different side of him, which I\u2019m so glad to have done this now, because I never really felt before that we really got into the nuts and bolts of Alaric and utilized all of his strength the way that we could\u2019ve, and I really feel like that\u2019s what this show is all about. It\u2019s going to be a great look at him, a new perspective on him. It is tailor-made for all of his strengths.Does Alaric have a new drinking buddy?\n                I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see him drinking so much. When you\u2019re the headmaster, you\u2019ve got to keep your drinking on the D.L. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s drinking as much these days. If he does, you might see him drinking with his pal Dorian, or maybe sharing a beer or two with Matt Donovan, hopefully, when they work all their stuff out.I\u2019ll believe he\u2019s not drinking when I smell his coffee.\n                [Laughs]\u00a0I think you might be on to something. He\u2019s got a little flask hidden away in his desk somewhere.He\u2019s the headmaster of this school, he\u2019s a father of two girls, and he\u2019s a father figure to Hope. How is he juggling all this? Does he constantly have a teenage girl mad at him?\n                He\u2019s definitely wondering where the heck Caroline is. Like, \u201cI can use some help right now, Caroline.\u201d [Laughs] You definitely see him balancing all those roles, all those relationships, and doing his best to service them all, but obviously you can\u2019t please everyone all the time, so he\u2019s going to come up short no matter how hard he tries. But he\u2019s always trying.Hope is obviously hesitant to get close to anyone given her history with loss, but surely Alaric can relate to that. Does that help them bond?\n                Yeah, it would be easier to play him cynical at this point. I think he can certainly relate to the loss, but I also think he\u2019s not about wallowing in it. He\u2019s all about just focusing on the responsibilities, the task at hand, and being the best that he can be as a father, a teacher, and a mentor. That\u2019s what keeps moving him forward.Legacies premieres Thursday, Oct. 25, at 9 p.m. ET on the CW.Related content:\u00a0"}
