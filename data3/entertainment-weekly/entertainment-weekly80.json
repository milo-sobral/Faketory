I was happy he defied the reaper and carried on. With Stan gone, an era really does come to an end. He was the happy huckster that comics needed. And he really did alliterate like that when you talked to him.\u2014 Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) November 12, 2018Devastated by my pal Stan's passing.

Stan Lee gave us more than co-creations X-Men, Iron Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four & Spider-Man. He gave us creeds to live by. Principles to emulate. Villains (and racism) to fight. He gave me vital cornerstones of my belief system. My sense of responsibility. pic.twitter.com/KxUpP7m23h\u2014 Brad Meltzer (@bradmeltzer) November 12, 2018Looked up from writing a Marvel script to see the news.Words can be complicated, even for writers.
