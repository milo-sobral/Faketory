{"id": "Female filmmakers urge future talent at SCAD Savannah Film Festival to find \u2018empowering\u2019 collaborators", "paragraph": "Female filmmakers gathered Monday at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival to offer insight into their careers and discuss the future of the women in film.EW\u2019s Ruth Kinane moderated two panels as part of the festival\u2019s Wonder Women series \u2014 one with producers and one with below-the-line crew members, including editors, cinematographers, and visual effects producers.Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (Free Solo), Kaila York, Paula DuPr\u00e9 Pesmen (Quincy), Amy Nauiokas (Can You Ever Forgive Me?), and Shannon Gibson and Lizzie Nastro (both of\u00a0One Cambodian Family Please For My Pleasure, part of Refinery29\u2019s female-helmed short film series, Shatterbox) assembled first for the producers\u2019 panel to share how they broke into the industry and offer advice to the students in the audience about how to build their careers.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get through to people you\u2019re working with if they\u2019re not empowering you,\u201d Pesmen told the audience. \u201cSo find people who trust you and empower you. Surround yourself with people who are collaborative and respectful.\u201d\u201cWith every no, just remember that there\u2019s an opportunity somewhere else,\u201d Gibson added.Meanwhile, the below-the-line panel \u2014 which included cinematographer Polly Morgan, editor Nancy Richardson, visual effects producer Sara Tremblay, editor Joi McMillon, and editor Plummy Tucker \u2014 went deep on the ins and outs of their jobs and how they\u2019ve learned to advocate for themselves.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid to tell [the director] ideas or how you could better service the story, you are not part of the filmmaking process,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cYou\u2019re just a person in a chair pushing buttons.\u201d\u201cWhen I meet the director, it\u2019s really important to know that we\u2019re on the same page and we\u2019re going to have the same sensibilities on the project,\u201d Morgan added. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that you and the director are strong collaborators and are on the same page and have each other\u2019s backs.\u201dAnd, they added, it\u2019s always easier to work with a director who can communicate their vision clearly. \u201c[Sometimes] they just tell you, \u2018Make it look crazy cool,'\u201d Tremblay said with a laugh. \u201cI get that note every episode. Crazy cool can be a lot of things!\u201dThe panelists also opened up about some of the sexism and prejudice they\u2019ve experienced working in the industry, from being mistaken for assistants to having their credentials second-guessed.\u201cIn editing, action editing is somehow something they think only guys can do,\u201d Richardson told the audience. \u201cI sometimes meet these big action editors at social events, and they\u2019re these little skinny guys! I\u2019m like, can I challenge you to arm wrestle?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same with action shooting,\u201d Morgan added. \u201cFor some reason it\u2019s hard to imagine a younger female shooting a huge stunt action sequence where things get blown up. I think that also I\u2019m more petite, so sometimes people wonder whether I can hold a camera on my shoulders. Which I can!\u201dBut the panelists agreed that they ultimately felt optimistic about the future of women in the industry \u2014 especially after seeing female filmmakers advocate for each other and themselves.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and we can probably all share frustrating stories,\u201d Nauiokas said. \u201cFor me, it feels palpably different in the last year. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re done or we fixed it all, it\u2019s all solved. But I think we\u2019ve had very honest conversations and the ability to call b.s. on some stuff, and we can now empower more women to work together and to partner together. There\u2019s safety and strength in numbers, and I think we have a lot of work to do, but it feels like we\u2019re making a step in the right direction. I would encourage everyone who has a desire to be a part of film to know that it sometimes can feel like a fight, but it can be well worth it. And we\u2019re making progress.\u201dRelated content:\u00a0"}
