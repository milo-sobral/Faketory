{"id": "Supergirl\u00a0casts Two and a Half Men's\u00a0Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor", "paragraph": "Jon Cryer is rejoining the Luthor family.On Friday, the CW announced that the Emmy-winning actor will recur as\u00a0Lex Luthor on\u00a0Supergirl. The\u00a0Two and a Half Men star will make his debut as the iconic Superman villain in the 15th episode of season 4.Cryer\u2019s casting is pretty funny given his history with the Luthor bloodline: The actor played Lenny Luthor, Lex\u2019s nephew, in\u00a0Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In fact, that\u2019s at least one of the reasons he was cast in the new role.\u201cWe are enormous fans of Jon Cryer, and he was instantly our dream actor to play the iconic role of Lex Luthor,\u201d said\u00a0Supergirl showrunners/executive producers Jessica Queller and Robert Rovner in a statement.\u00a0\u201cJon is a super-talent, and the fact that he played Lenny Luthor in Superman IV brings an added layer of legacy to his casting.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re beyond thrilled to welcome Jon to the Supergirl family.\u201dThough Lex hasn\u2019t appeared on\u00a0Supergirl yet, his presence has loomed over the series since season 2, which introduced both his sister, Lena (Katie McGrath), who runs his company while he\u2019s serving multiple life sentences, and his villainous mother, Lillian (Brenda Strong), who is presently behind bars as well. It\u2019s currently unclear how Lex will figure into the narrative, but odds are he\u2019ll play a part in this season\u2019s exploration of xenophobia.The list of actors who have previously played the criminal genius and billionaire includes\u00a0Michael Rosenbaum (Smallville), Jesse Eisenberg (Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice), Kevin Spacey (Superman Returns), and Gene Hackman (the Christopher Reeve\u00a0Superman\u00a0movies). Clancy Brown delivered an equally memorable turn as the voice of Lex on the DC Animated Universe shows\u00a0Superman: The Animated Series and\u00a0Justice League.In addition to\u00a0Superman IV and\u00a0Two and a Half Men, Cryer\u2019s screen credits include the John Hughes cult classic\u00a0Pretty in Pink and a recent guest appearance on\u00a0Will & Grace.\u00a0He just wrapped production on\u00a0Big Time Adolescence, a coming-of-age drama starring\u00a0Saturday Night Live\u2019s Pete Davidson.Supergirl airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on the CW.Related content:"}
