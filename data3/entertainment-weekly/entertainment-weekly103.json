{"id": "Fantastic Beasts sequel's shocking ending explained", "paragraph": "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald concluded with a rather huge surprise twist in its final moments which changes Harry Potter canon forever.[Spoilers follow] Throughout the film, orphaned Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) was searching for his true identity in Paris. Fans \u2014 and even some other characters \u2014 had assumed he was the long-lost brother of Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz). Except Leta had actually swapped her troublesome infant younger brother with another, quieter baby during a sea voyage, and her actual brother then tragically drowned after the ship was sunk during a storm (The Crimes of Grindelwald is not a film that\u2019s exactly shy about killing off kids). In the movie\u2019s final moments, Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) reveals\u00a0Credence\u2019s real name is Aurelius Dumbledore and says his \u201cbrother\u201d (presumably Albus) is trying to kill him. A phoenix even appears, which we were reminded earlier in the film will always come to a Dumbledore in need (though it\u2019s unclear why, after being in so much danger and drama, the magical creature would come to Credence now).According to the Harry Potter books, Albus only has one brother (Aberforth). He also had a troubled sister (Ariana), who seemingly was an Obscurial (just like Credence). She was accidentally killed during a duel between Albus and Grindelwald, an incident that has weighed on Albus ever since.Credence being a Dumbledore helps explain his tremendous magical ability, and gives him a personal connection to Grindelwald\u2019s enemy moving forward. It also potentially gives Albus a second chance at salvation \u2014 he couldn\u2019t save Ariana, but maybe he can save Aurelius?(Fun fact, possibly a coincidence: The name\u00a0Aurelius has a connection to the first actor who played Dumbledore: Richard Harris also played the doomed Marcus\u00a0Aurelius in Gladiator.)So that\u2019s what we know. What we don\u2019t know is pretty much everything else. The reveal raises a ton of questions and, taken at face value, doesn\u2019t seem to make a whole lot of sense. But let\u2019s look closer.First, let\u2019s assume Grindelwald is telling the truth. He could be lying, sure, but that feels unlikely \u2014 Rowling\u2019s big reveals at the end of her novels tend to be true because, otherwise, what\u2019s the point? But it\u2019s also hard to imagine why the brother of one of the most famous wizards of all time was never previously mentioned by anyone (how could Rita Skeeter miss this one?). The situation is not unlike a controversial move made by another prequel, Star Trek: Discovery, and it\u2019s decision to give Spock an adopted sister.And as\u00a0pointed out by The Rowling Library, the ages don\u2019t add up. Albus\u2019 father, Percival, was sent to Azkaban prison and eventually died there the year before Albus went to Hogwarts \u2014 so when the future professor and headmaster was about 10 \u2014 and Credence and Albus are definitely more than 10 years apart. (Then again, Crimes of Grindelwald also shows a young Minerva McGonagall working at Hogwarts, even though her character was apparently born several years after the film takes place).What\u2019s also unclear is whether Albus knows\u00a0Credence is his brother. One would assume so, as Albus seems to know more about\u00a0Credence than what he\u2019s saying aloud and, well, he usually the smartest character in the room. But if what Grindelwald is saying is true, and Albus knows it, it\u2019s hard to imagine Dumbledore would advocate a plan of action in Crimes which could lead to his own brother\u2019s death.There are theories out there. Perhaps Ariana\u2019s\u00a0Obscurus is possessing Credence and that\u2019s the \u201cbrother\u201d Grindelwald is referring to? Maybe Credence is actually\u00a0Ariana\u2019s secret son (but then who is the \u201cbrother\u201d?). Could Albus\u2019 father have conceived Aurelius at Azkaban? (Having sex with Dementors hovering around seems pretty tough to pull off.)One thing is for sure: Rowling wouldn\u2019t make this move without a clear explanation. To know for sure, we\u2019ll have to wait for the third film in the series, which is expected in 2020.Related content:"}
