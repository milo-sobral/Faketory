And tonight, all of us are with you.\u201dFor inspiration in this dark time, the host commended CelebrateMercy and MPower Change, two Muslim-American non-profit groups, for raising nearly $183,000 (at the time this article was published) through their \u201cMuslims Unite for Pittsburgh Synagogue\u201d fundraiser. Colbert also noted the 2,500 people who gathered for a memorial service at the University of Pittsburgh.\u201cIt is going to take much more than this to break the resolve of the Jewish people,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cThey will continue to worship, to learn, and to sing.\u201dPivoting to President Trump, the host said \u201cour first mistake\u201d as a nation was looking to our commander in chief \u201cfor comfort and guidance\u201d during this time. Colbert criticized Trump for his response to the shooting, specifically how he said the deaths could\u2019ve been avoided if the synagogue had armed guards and for not canceling his political rally in the aftermath.Trump claimed he didn\u2019t cancel his rally in Illinois because the New York Stock Exchange remained opened in the days following 9/11. \u201cThat is an inspiring story, if any of it was true,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cbecause the New York Stock Exchange was closed until Sep. 17. So Trump\u2019s instinct when addressing a tragedy was to lie about another tragedy. I think lying about anything associated with 9/11 is a disqualifier for the presidency or, really, having any job.\u201dRelated content:"}
