So, when EW asks Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood what they might be getting each other to commemorate their eleventh time hosting the CMA Awards, next Wednesday, Nov. 14 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC, Underwood jokingly exclaims, \u201cSwords!\u201dClearly a Game of Thrones fan, Paisley adds, \u201cYes, we got each other Valyrian steel swords.\u201d (Valyrian steel is the preferred sword material\u00a0for those in the know in Westeros.) \u201cI\u2019m getting Widow\u2019s Wail.\u201dUnderwood interjects that she is more of a Walking Dead gal and would prefer something more in the key of Michonne\u2019s katana. Perhaps she could use it to keep Paisley in line during the telecast? \u201cI think that\u2019s an excellent idea,\u201d she says.Read on to see who the always jovial Underwood \u2014 who is nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year and Music Video of the Year for the title track to her album Cry Pretty\u00a0\u2014 and Paisley are rooting for this year, how they\u2019re crafting their monologue, and who they\u2019re excited to see perform on country music\u2019s biggest night.Paisley and Underwood goofed around with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill dolls during the 2014 CMA Awards.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You\u2019re probably not allowed to openly root for anyone given that you\u2019re the hosts but\u2026are their artists you\u2019re hoping to see win?Underwood:\u00a0I would say I hope I win! I\u2019m okay with that.Paisley:\u00a0I hope Carrie doesn\u2019t win.Underwood: Everybody hopes that they\u2019ll win. Anybody who tells you that it\u2019s just an honor to be nominated \u2014 it is, but they want to win.Are there performances you all are looking forward to?Paisley: Yeah, Ricky Skaggs is going in the [Country Music] Hall of Fame and I\u2019m excited about being a part of a tribute to him, which will be fun. What a legend. There\u2019s gonna be some really great playing on that. Maybe not from me, but somebody will play really well on that.Underwood:\u00a0I\u2019m always looking forward to seeing just what people show up and put on. I know everybody wants their performances to be unique and special. It\u2019s always been interesting to see who comes up with what, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anyone that I\u2019m looking specifically forward to, but it\u2019s bound to be a good night and full of lots of people just giving it their all.Carrie, you normally do a number of costume changes. I\u2019m assuming that at this stage of your pregnancy, that might make things a little trickier this year. Are you still planning multiple outfits?Underwood:\u00a0I\u2019m gonna give it my all. We had a fitting recently and I thought I would cry but I didn\u2019t so that was off to a good start. [Laughs] We came up with some things and I think we\u2019re gonna have another [fitting] within the next couple of days. We\u2019ll see what else they come up with and I\u2019ll do my best.In terms of the monologue, how close to actual show time are you still polishing it and working on the jokes?Paisley: Hopefully, we\u2019re done on Monday and then we\u2019re just working out the kinks. Quite often we\u2019re trying to figure something out on Wednesday that isn\u2019t working.Underwood:\u00a0Yeah, we\u2019re tweaking \u2019til the end.Can we expect some humorous songs during the monologue?Paisley: Well, there\u2019ll be songs. Whether they\u2019re humorous or not will all depend on how well we do this weekend with the writing.Carrie: We hope people laugh!Given the current headlines, from the recent shootings to the political climate, how do you all approach balancing reverence for the moment with keeping things entertaining to give people a few laughs to escape?Paisley: I don\u2019t know. I think you just know when you\u2019re in the moment when it\u2019s time to sort of add levity. We\u2019re trying to balance a little bit of that but at the same time, I think everybody\u2019s gonna be tuning in next week largely for more of the levity. Largely for the chance to get away and we\u2019re gonna try our best \u2014 especially with our monologue, which exists to be funny \u2014 to give them that.Carrie, we know that you will be heading out on tour in 2019. Brad what do you have on tap next musically?Paisley: I\u2019m releasing a song next week. I\u2019ll announce some tour stuff coming up soon as well.So we have that to look forward to in 2019?Paisley:\u00a0Look forward to or dread, whatever your perspective may be.
