That\u2019s the question Jackson-Cohen is now asking himself, thanks to this potentially ominous detail in the finale.\u201cThere\u2019s this thing that happens when we\u2019re all in the Red Room,\u201d Jackson-Cohen told The Wrap in an interview. \u201cEvery, uh \u2014 again, I feel like I have to be careful if I\u2019m saying this right. [Laughs] But whenever each child, each sibling, is in the Red Room, something in the fantasy is red. And it\u2019ll be a very, very small thing. For Luke, when Luke gets taken to the hotel room, he\u2019s worn Converse throughout the show, and all of a sudden his Converse are red. And it\u2019s so slight you can barely even see it. And I think Steven is wearing a red jumper [in his fantasy.]\u201dYup, that checks out. Luke has been wearing black Cons all throughout the series, including his solo episode, \u201cThe Twin Thing.\u201d In the finale, he\u2019s spotted with red shoes in the spooky hotel room scene.We\u2019re with you so far, Jackson-Cohen.\u201cAnd so there\u2019s something at the end \u2014 it was Kate [Siegel], who plays Theo, who kind of pointed it out to me \u2014 with Luke\u2019s sobriety cake,\u201d the actor continued. \u201cUm, she went, \u2018The cake is red.\u2019 And on set I went, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 And she went, \u2018I don\u2019t know!\u2019 And I asked Mike [Flanagan], and he went \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And so I can\u2019t tell whether or not I\u2019m just crazy with this \u2014 or whether or not it\u2019s something that could have legs.\u201dThere lies the question: Is the scene with the family reunited around Luke real or is it another chilling vision from the Red Room? Viewers have been fooled before.Flanagan previously told EW he and the writers \u201ctoyed with a cliffhanger ending\u201d when thinking about the possibility of a second season.\u00a0\u201cUltimately, in the writers\u2019 room and with the cast and everything else, we really felt like the story demanded a certain kind of closure from us and we were happy to close the book on that family,\u201d he said.As far as he\u2019s concerned, \u201cThe story of the Crain family is told. It\u2019s done.\u201d Whether that story had a happy ending or the one Jackson-Cohen suggested seems up for debate.Related content:"}
