{"id": "Exclusive: Listen to John Williams' new\u00a0score for Disney's Star Wars theme parks", "paragraph": "While exploring the furthest reaches of the galaxy, you\u2019re going to need some traveling music.Legendary composer John Williams will provide an original score that visitors will hear within the attractions of the Star Wars-themed land of Galaxy\u2019s Edge, opening at Disney\u2019s theme parks next year.Entertainment Weekly has an exclusive preview of Williams\u2019 score in the video above, along with a new aerial view of the alien world of Batuu, currently under construction at both Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida.The village, known as Black Spire, is a remote trading outpost tucked amid the rocky spikes of an ancient petrified forest. The town serves as a Casablanca-like nexus between the forces of good, evil, and in between as they clash over control of the galaxy.Below, we also feature exclusive new previews of the two main rides:\u00a0the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run experience and a space battle called\u00a0Rise of the Resistance, which takes place aboard a First Order starship.Disney tells EW there will be even more music for the 14-acre park expansions from Williams, who is also working on director J.J. Abrams\u2019 Episode IX\u00a0for next December.The video above is a sample of the Oscar winner\u2019s overarching theme for Galaxy\u2019s Edge,\u00a0an alternately playful and majestic introduction that was recently recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, conducted by Williams\u2019 longtime associate William Ross.News that Williams is contributing music will be formally unveiled today at the fan gathering Destination D in Orlando, along with video previews of the Star Wars\u00a0attractions from Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products.For those not at the Orlando event, EW has an exclusive look at what he\u2019ll be showing off.\u00a0First, a video that shows visitors firing up the engines of the ride known as Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run\u00a0(no apostrophe), which will put them inside the cockpit of Han Solo\u2019s \u201cfastest ship in the galaxy\u201d for a daring escape from Batuu. Guests can take on one of three different duties to make sure the mission is a success.In the Rise of the Resistance attraction, guests will experience what it\u2019s like to be caught in the crossfire of a deep-space battle between the First Order and the X-Wing dogfighters of the Resistance.This video was actually shot inside the finished interior of the ride, which allows visitors to explore the hangar bay and control deck of a First Order destroyer.At one point in the adventure, sources tell EW, visitors will come face to face in battle against Kylo Ren.Finally, we have a new look at the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0hotel planned for the Walt Disney World Resort.It\u2019s an innovative concept that turns the accommodations into their own ride with a multiday experience that immerses visitors amid characters inhabiting an orbiting luxury starship.The journey begins with guests boarding a shuttle pod that transports them from Earth to their hotel in space. Here we see concept art of how the pod \u201cdocks\u201d with the larger starship. (That astromech droid looks a lot like R2-D2, which would add bellhop to his many duties.)And here is an interior look, with a family riding the pod to begin their vacation in the galaxy.The Galaxy\u2019s Edge experience at Disneyland will open in the summer, while the one at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios will debut next fall.Related content:"}
