Despite reaching America somewhat safely (after a particularly rough time on the seas) at the end of last season, the century-crossed couple isn\u2019t exactly settling into pre-Revolutionary War life with ease. \u201cIt is\u00a0Outlander,\u201d says Balfe by way of explanation, adding that staying anywhere that owns slaves is just not something Claire can abide. \u201cShe just can\u2019t have that.\u201dThere\u2019s also some grappling with his conscience for Jamie. \u201cHe does a deal with the British which obviously is kind of against everything he\u2019s believed in before,\u201d Heughan explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s a real new opportunity for them and they both fall in the love with the land and see the opportunity there \u2014 and an opportunity to create change in America and in an America that\u2019s in its infancy.\u201dSurely things are running a little more smoothly on the other side of the standing stones for Brianna (Sophie Skelton) and Roger (Richard Rankin) though? \u201cTheir story is just a perfect union that doesn\u2019t go wrong in any way, shape or form, it isn\u2019t tested to the absolute limits and doesn\u2019t drive Roger crazy,\u201d says Rankin sarcastically. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d So that\u2019s a no then.Outlander returns to Starz Nov. 4 at 8 p.m. ET.
