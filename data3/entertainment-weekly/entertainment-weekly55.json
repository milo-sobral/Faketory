Alamo also had a national voter awareness PSA contest, partnerships with civic leaders on non-partisan voter registration campaigns, distribution of \u201cI\u2019m So Gonna Vote\u201d stickers at the box office, put their famous \u201cno talking, no texting\u201d policy up for a \u201cvote,\u201d and even encouraged employees to become registrars to staff voter sign-up tables in the theaters\u2019 lobbies. All 36 Alamo locations will participate in the Election Day hours plan.While the company has grown rapidly in recent years \u2014 adding theaters in New York, San Francisco and, soon, Los Angeles \u2014 the chain is based in Texas, which is in the middle of a particularly intense Senate race between incumbent Ted Cruz and challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke, with the state having seen record turnout in early voting."}
