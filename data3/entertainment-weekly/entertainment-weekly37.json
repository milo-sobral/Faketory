{"id": "High School Musical 3\u00a0turns 10: An appreciation", "paragraph": "Ah, the days of optimism! Tell me, oh muse, of that lost golden era, of new hope looking forward to the future that would never end. Oct. 24, 2008, autumn leaves falling, recession blooming, election looming, phones growing smarter, media going social, and here came\u00a0High School Musical 3: Senior Year.It was the TV franchise\u2019s first theatrically released film. Pause to explain words like \u201ctheatrical\u201d and \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cfilm\u201d to the new youth snorting infinite content through cloud-connected Mother Boxes,\u00a0but one thing I\u2019ll always love is just how stoked High School Musical 3 is to be a\u00a0movie. The opening title flares on screen, five words nestled into a giant 3. That number\u2019s lit up with 18 light bulbs, and then every light bulb explodes one after another, and then the whole title explodes into a glitter storm, which dissolves into the face of Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) whipping his sweaty proto-Bieberian moptop back and forth.He\u2019s playing basketball, but the extreme close-up and the slow motion give this opening shot an intimacy the MPAA might churchily describe as \u201csome sensuality.\u201d And for a millisecond the dissolve suggests sparkledrops of perspiration light-speeding outwards, every Efronian follicle exploding into radiant dew.We\u2019re starting\u00a0in medias res, midway through a championship game. The first non-grunted line of dialogue spoken on screen is an inspiring halftime speech delivered by Coach/dad-of-Troy Jack (Bart Johnson). Then Troy gives another inspiring halftime speech with co-captain/BFF Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu). Then the second half plays out to \u201cNow or Never,\u201d a jock jam with a whisper-rap group chorus, and an impossibly romantic interlude where Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) scream-sings her boyfriend\u2019s name \u201cTROOOOOOOOOOOYYYY!!!!\u201d so loud that the whole world goes dark.The first High School Musical\u00a0emerged as a phenomenon in 2006. This was the decade when Disney invented and/or perfected every notion of tween fandom, factory-cranking smiley-happy ingenues into the cultural machinery. I guess you could pinpoint\u00a0High School Musical as a logical extension of the ethos behind\u00a0Lizzie McGuire,\u00a0Hannah Montana, the rise of the Jonas Brothers, and the briefly potent notion of Lindsay Lohan as a multihyphenate pop star.But the initial success of the\u00a0HSM\u00a0telefilm felt like a happy fluke: The director of\u00a0Newsies taking a cast of unknowns to sing new music in Utah, with a budget big enough to pay for three minutes of a\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean. That director, Kenny Ortega, generated lots of playful choreography. Songwriter David Lawrence crafted pop tunes with an old-fashioned wink, piling trendy Auto-Tuney warbling atop occasional piano glissandi.\u00a0And the story was a demographic dream. You had Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), drama-kid\u00a0in extremis, a character who in HSM3\u00a0casually describes one dance number as \u201csome kind of yoga Fosse thing.\u201d But you entered her universe via Troy, a basketball-playing dudely dude, surely not the sort of person who can sing, sing, SSIIIIIIIIING!All the young stars were very energetic, and there was something pleasantly achievable about\u00a0High School Musical\u2019s cheapo look. You felt invited to join in like this production was only half-finished and could use some more extras. The results were big ratings and a hit soundtrack that human beings paid analog dollars to purchase.There followed\u00a0High School Musical 2, a somewhat loathsome gloss on the material. Sharpay got villainized, and true fans know she\u2019s the morally ambiguous antihero. Class warfare was a theme, really just not Disney\u2019s bag; its ultimate socioeconomic lesson can only ever be \u201cGLORY TO THEY WHO CONSUME.\u201d HSM2 replaced basketball with baseball, which just plain did not work for a dance number.\u00a0Baseball is a chill sport for dadbods, whereas every basketball game is already [pushes glasses up nose] a kind of dance.Perhaps this all seems helplessly specific in a prose poem dedicated to a G-rated threequel about happy cute teenagers singing through problems they barely have. But HSM2 lost the thread a bit, and\u00a0HSM3\u00a0found the thread, and the thread was a fuse, and look at the fireworks, kaboom!Now they had a reported budget around $11 million, big enough to pay for seven minutes of a\u00a0Chronicles of Narnia.\u00a0The screenplay, by Peter Barsocchini, has one major plot point: The whole cast of characters is putting on a high school musical called\u00a0Senior Year. It\u2019s based on their lives and they\u2019re playing themselves, very much like\u00a0Synecdoche, New York.\u00a0There is a loose sense of competition: Some grandees from Juilliard are coming round to the big show to lay some scholarships on two students, but which two students? There is one big problem: Troy and Gabriella love each other, but what future do they have together? They\u2019re high school sweethearts heading in different directions post-graduation. Gabriella didn\u2019t just get into Stanford \u2014 she got into Stanford\u2019s\u00a0freshman honors program, a why-not plot contrivance that forces her to start college while high school is still happening. (Cruel Stanford!) Troy wants Gabriella, and he wants to play basketball, and he wants to SSIIIIIIIIING!\u00a0Which perfect opportunity will this perfect boy choose?Whatever: The story\u2019s just stringing together one ecstatic pop number after another. Troy and Gabriella sing love the tune \u201cRight Here, Right Now\u201d on a gigantically unreal treehouse rotating in front of a glistening starry, starry night. And they waltz together through \u201cCan I Have This Dance?\u201d on the school rooftop, exterior suburban nowhere stretching to the snowcapped mountains on the horizon. It\u2019s weird, there were much bigger movie musicals made since the\u00a0High School Musical\u00a0franchise was a thing:\u00a0Sweeney Todd and\u00a0Les Mis\u00e9rables,\u00a0Into the Woods\u00a0and The Greatest Showman,\u00a0La La Land and just now\u00a0A Star is Born. The usual instinct,\u00a0Showman\u00a0aside, is to aim for a sense of realism: unbroken close-ups on Hathawayvian nasal quivers, dance numbers through on-location Los Angeles monuments, musical numbers filmed like danceless shot-reverse-shot dialogue scenes, credibility-minting shaky camera.Whereas Ortega\u2019s instincts in\u00a0HSM3 are fully hyperbolic. At the end of \u201cCan I Have This Dance?\u201d the heavens open, and rain falls in the desert. The weather is emotionally reactive, see. When Troy dances alone through an empty school in \u201cScream,\u201d the locker corridors spin like the spaceship centrifuge in 2001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0and a storm outside crashes mad-science lightning.Late in the movie, Troy drives a thousand miles on prom night to be with Gabriella. They dance around a tree, and they\u2019re suddenly with their friends at school, or maybe they\u2019re on stage playacting \u201cprom\u201d for their high school musical.\u00a0Spectacle carries them forward, and Ortega gives good spectacle.\u00a0You realize how hamstrung certain screen musicals are today, cutting around movie stars who can\u2019t quite sing or dance. Whereas HSM3 comes to life in the big group numbers. Like \u201cA Night to Remember,\u201d the best girl-squad vs. boy-squad song since\u00a0Grease\u2019s \u201cSummer Nights,\u201d plus bonus points for not featuring the lyric \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d Or the moment in \u201cThe Boys are Back\u201d when an Efron-Bleu duet suddenly grows a crew of backup dancers dressed like\u00a0Road Warrior cosplayers. Halfway through \u201cScream,\u201d basketballs rain down on Troy, for you see he is haunted by basketball, people!The performances mostly run the gamut from \u201chappy to be here\u201d to \u201creally happy to be here,\u201d but the chemistry between Hudgens and Efron gives all their scenes a little glow. Their big kiss in the reprise of \u201cCan I Have This Dance\u201d is\u00a0sexy, or anyhow the most sexy-ish moment to crash through the G-rating this century. They were dating then, and then eventually they weren\u2019t. Things end, and for a hot second when Hudgens sings a song called \u201cWalk Away,\u201d\u00a0High School Musical 3 is very nearly \u201cabout\u201d endings.But the pinnacle \u2014 of film and franchise and whole Disney era \u2014 is \u201cI Want it All,\u201d a duet between Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel (who plays Sharpay\u2019s twin, Ryan). It\u2019s an all-time banger about ludicrous aspiration and is without question the most recognizable 2000s-ish aspect of\u00a0HSM3. This whole franchise was set in a definably retro version of Americana: a diverse ensemble nevertheless dominated by beloved popular jock dude, the possibility of social disparity acknowledged but quickly overcome. Whereas \u201cI Want it All\u201d is a full-blown inhalation of the pre-crash gilded age, with Sharpay playacting a safe-for-kids variation of every starlet saga from the \u201cBritney\u2019s Clubbing With Paris\u201d era.\u00a0\u201cI want it all!\u201d she proclaims: the fame, the fortune, the glam, the press only giving you the best reviews!The school cafeteria transforms into a stage, Hollywood, Manhattan, a red carpet step-and-repeat colored neon magenta. The other characters become background extras in the Rise of Sharpay. Troy playacts the kind of rabid fandom Efron himself had researched up close. Credit Efron for uncanny physicality. This was perfect selfie form, children, before smartphones invented the frontal camera.HSM3 is mostly a chill hang (or \u201crepetitively plotless\u201d if you\u2019re feeling icy) but close examination of Sharpay\u2019s role hints toward hidden tragedy. She begins in a position of absolute power, the supernova of the drama department. She even gets a personal assistant, a freshman student named Tiara Gold (Jemma McKenzie Brown). But how all occasions do inform against Sharpay. Drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) decides to cast the spring musical with everyone in the senior class, giving the prime roles of \u201cTroy\u201d and \u201cGabriella\u201d to, well, Troy and Gabriella.And Tiara\u2019s out to replace Sharpay, a full-blown\u00a0All About Evening that brutally implies Sharpay\u2019s already past her prime at 18. Tisdale circa 2008 was getting the full Disney star windup, so her comic desperation here looks downright noble: a teenybopper brazenly playing yesterday\u2019s news, grasping for the spotlight one last time.The musical ends with all the stars announcing where they\u2019re going to college, like precisely no one ever has in real life, and the lineup\u2019s a parental dream. Chad got a a basketball scholarship to a Pac-10ish powerhouse, Gabriella\u2019s already at Stanford, Troy\u2019s across the Bay at Berkeley. Taylor (Monique Coleman) is going to Yale, to study political science. Choreographer Ryan got one Juilliard scholarship, songwriter Kelsi (Olesya Rulin) got the other. (There\u2019s something delightfully wonky in HSM3\u2018s suggestion that Juilliard\u2019s way more impressed with the people composing the musical than the stars performing it.)\u00a0And Ms. Darbus announces that Sharpay is going to school nearby, close enough to \u201creturn to East High next fall to assist me in running the drama department.\u201dI don\u2019t want to say this is an \u201cunhappy ending\u201d for Sharpay. Indeed, the prospect of seeing her as a super-glam drama club T.A. is way more exciting than the actual Broadway-bound spin-off she received. But it\u2019s a dose of reality amid\u00a0HSM3\u2019s fanfare. Like, nominal hero Troy gets everything he wants by attending Berkeley, herein representing a Gabriella-adjacent utopia where every basketball player can also find time to\u00a0SSIIIIIIIIING! Meanwhile, Sharpay loses the chance at a drama school scholarship (to her twin brother!). Her new ambition is to work part-time at the school she once dominated. Her struggle, goofy as it is, looks real.\u201cReal\u201d not really being a word you could use very often describing\u00a0HSM3. Mere months later, the Fox hit\u00a0Glee added Idol-y karaoke and social consciousness to the high school musical format, ever so slightly snagging this hot idea someone had of a varsity athlete with a song in his heart. Viewed from 2018, HSM3\u00a0looks helplessly sanitized, a floating vision of teen life that never existed anywhere, an impossible place where everyone can agreeably sing how \u201cWe\u2019re All in This Together.\u201dAnd Disney is a world engine churning out intellectual property installments, aggressively rebooting old animated musicals with famous actors who can kiiinda sing, maybe. So there\u2019s something retroactively specific about\u00a0HSM3:\u00a0Here, a\u00a0cinematic universe built from drama club, basketball, college applications, righteously blond ambition, a half-remembered feeling that anything was possible. Ms. Arbus gives Troy worthwhile advice: \u201cBetter to consider opportunities now than in ten years when life may limit your choices.\u201d Ten years later, life has limited so many choices. But back then, we wanted it all."}
