{"id": "SNL brings on wounded veteran politician to get revenge on Pete Davidson", "paragraph": "This week\u2019s edition of Saturday Night Live\u2018s Weekend Update served as a sequel of sorts to last week\u2019s episode. Pete Davidson followed up on his insult of newly-elected Congressman Dan Crenshaw by bringing the politician on to the show to get his revenge and share a serious message about respecting veterans. Crenshaw, a Republican politician and military veteran who lost his eye in Afghanistan in 2012, had been targeted by Davidson as part of SNL\u2019s midterms preview. Davidson mocked the politician\u2019s injury, saying he looked like a \u201chitman in a porno.\u201d Davidson had quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\u201d This week, in the wake of Crenshaw\u2019s election to represent Texas\u2019 2nd Congressional District, Davidson was sincerely apologetic, saying, \u201cIn what I\u2019m sure was a huge shock for people who know me, I made a poor choice last week.\u201d Throughout the episode, SNL had been talking about the midterms in very apolitical terms, making jokes about trying to find common ground between Republican and Democratic supporters. Davidson continued that trajectory, describing the past week\u2019s outrage about his Crenshaw joke by saying, \u201cThe left and right finally came together to agree on something: That I\u2019m a dick.\u201d\u201cYou think?\u201d Crenshaw said as he suddenly entered the scene.Davidson\u2019s \u201cpoor choice\u201d line also appeared to be a reference to his recent breakup with singer Ariana Grande, and it wasn\u2019t the last one. After Crenshaw accepted Davidson\u2019s apology, he got a call on his cellphone \u2014 and the ringtone was none other than Grande\u2019s song \u201cBreathin.\u201d Davidson, seemingly unprepared for the gag, laughed in response. The comedian then\u00a0offered Crenshaw the chance to roast a picture of him to make up for his prior insult, and Crenshaw reluctantly accepted. \u201cThis is Pete Davidson,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cHe looks like if the meth from Breaking Bad was a person.\u201d And then, \u201che looks like a Troll doll with a tapeworm.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t all fun and games, though. Since this week\u2019s episode of SNL happened to fall on Veteran\u2019s Day weekend, Crenshaw addressed viewers at home on the best way to respect the service of veterans like him. His main advice? If you see a veteran, tell them, \u201cnever forget.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWhen you say \u2018never forget,\u2019 you are implying that as an American you are in it with them, not separated by a barrier between civilians and veterans,\u201d Crenshaw said directly to the camera. \u201cNever forget those we lost in war, and never forget those we lost on 9/11, like Pete\u2019s father.\u201d He and Davidson then each respectfully told each other, \u201cNever forget.\u201d\u00a0Watch a clip of Crenshaw\u2019s Davidson roast above.Related Links:"}
