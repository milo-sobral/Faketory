In 1998, Curtis played the part in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, having previously not portrayed Strode since 1981\u2019s Halloween II. Directed by Steve Miner, and co-starring Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, and Josh Hartnett, H20 was a box office hit and is remembered fondly by many fans of the slasher series. But Curtis still regrets that the two other creative principals responsible for the original 1978 film, director John Carpenter and the late producer Debra Hill, did not oversee the project, as she had originally hoped.\u201cWhen Halloween was, like, 19 years old, I remember calling John and Debra and we had lunch,\u201d says Curtis. \u201cI said to them, \u2018Guys, the movie\u2019s going to be 20 years old next year, and we\u2019re all still doing the job 20 years later.\u2019 I said to them, \u2018Why don\u2019t we revisit it?\u2019 And there was a conversation, but then everybody was busy, and it turned out not to be what I wanted it to be. Initially, I wanted it to be with John directing, Debra producing. And that didn\u2019t happen, for myriad reasons. And John didn\u2019t write it, so then we had to hire a writer, and then Debra had something else. By the end of it, I was the only one involved with it.\u201cNow, to this day, I regret that I didn\u2019t say to everyone, If Debra Hill\u2019s not the one producing this movie, I\u2019m not doing it. But what ended up happening was, she wasn\u2019t part of it, John wasn\u2019t part of it, and I was still part of it, and it was a machine going down the road. I was excited about it, and, honestly, I was going to be paid well. I hadn\u2019t made any money on the Halloween franchise at all. I mean, really, in all of those years I hadn\u2019t really made any money. It just gave me a lot of fame. And now I was going to get a paycheck.\u201cAnd I was excited about it, because I liked where we were going with [the film]. It was, in a weird way, a movie about post-traumatic stress then. The difference [from the new Halloween] was, it was someone who had run. So, she had fled from Haddonfield, she had changed her name, she had run as fast as she could in the other direction, and Michael Myers caught up with her. But, you see, she told no one, no one knew who she was, she was a new person in a new town. She had a child and her life was proceeding. And I liked that. By the way, I insisted she be an alcoholic, I insisted that she not\u00a0be traumatized. And then, of course, there\u2019s a moment when she turns back. Because really the intent of that movie was to say, You really aren\u2019t alive if you\u2019re running for your life all the time. If you\u2019re running for your life your whole life, you\u2019re not alive. So, you\u2019re really dead. So, if you\u2019re dead, why not try to face the fear, and in the facing of the fear maybe you\u2019ll die, but if you don\u2019t die, maybe you\u2019ll finally live. And that was really the emotional intent of that movie.\u201cIf you see that movie, it\u2019s not a great movie, it\u2019s a good movie, and that emotional intent is in the movie. But it was never what I hoped it would be for all these reasons that ended up being things that were out of my control.\u201dWatch the trailer for Halloween: H20\u00a0above.Related content:"}
