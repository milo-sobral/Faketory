{"id": "How The Goldbergs got Robert Englund to reprise Freddy Krueger for its Halloween episode", "paragraph": "A series centering on \u201980s nostalgia wouldn\u2019t be complete without an episode honoring the mother of all horror movies, A Nightmare on Elm Street. And that tribute wouldn\u2019t be a proper one without Robert Englund, who is the man responsible for bringing iconic dream demon Freddy Krueger to life. For\u00a0The Goldbergs\u2018 Halloween episode (Oct. 24 at 8 p.m. on ABC), the titular family deals with the fallout of Adam watching the 1984 movie against mom Beverly\u2019s wishes. While he deals with the ensuing scary dreams, she finds herself living a true nightmare after Adam tells Beverly that he wishes she wasn\u2019t his mom. Ahead, stars Wendi McLendon-Covey (Beverly), Sean Giambrone (Adam), guest star Englund, creator/EP Adam F. Goldberg, and EP/director Lew Schneider reveal how the \u201cnightmare\u201d episode came together.\u201cThis [movie] was the first place I go to when I think of my childhood and Halloween. [I told Robert Englund] when I saw this movie \u2014 Part 3 [Dream Warriors] \u2014 I went home and I threw up all night. I didn\u2019t sleep all week. It was so real to me, and my mom was freaking out and was trying everything \u2014 baths, the whole thing. That was a traumatic experience for me,\u201d series creator and executive producer Adam F. Goldberg recalls. \u201cSo every year I say to the writers, \u2018Let\u2019s take the shot and try and get Robert to be Freddy,\u2019 and everyone said, \u2018Let\u2019s do something we could actually make \u2014 we\u2019ll do Poltergeist instead.\u2019 So this year I took the shot. It\u2019s just one of those bucket list things to try and do this Freddy episode. It took quite a bit convincing \u2014 I first approached Robert\u2019s manager, who knew the show, he related to the show, he knew we would treat it with respect, we would treat it real, and I get why that\u2019s a hard sell, to have Freddy Krueger on The Goldbergs. I wrote from my heart, I said, \u2018This character is in my DNA, starting with the trauma, then turning into something with my friends\u2019 \u2014 this was our bonding thing, making these horror movies \u2014 \u2018this is why I do what I do now,\u2019 and Robert responded and said, \u2018I trust you.'\u201dEnglund hasn\u2019t appeared on screen as the iconic character since 2003\u2019s Freddy vs. Jason, but this was an opportunity he couldn\u2019t say no to.\u00a0\u201cThe serendipity for me was not only wanting to work with Wendi, but also\u2026the last 10 or 15 years, people have approached me and told me these family stories about watching A Nightmare on Elm Street in the exact same period as The Goldbergs. The generation from the \u201980s that saw it, Adam\u2019s generation, remember it now as a family-shared experience \u2014 getting to go to the mom and dad video store to rent it, pre-Blockbuster, pay-per-view, see it on whatever cable existed back then, a marathon for Halloween\u2026and I get this response from people who\u2019ve lost a parent now or an older brother that went to Iraq or somewhere, and they have this memory of a family being scared together and being alive together and eating pizza together and cracking open a brew together in the living room of the family home somewhere in America the first time new movies were brought home for a whole new generation,\u201d Englund says.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s something I never, ever imagined, that you\u2019d consider Nightmare on Elm Street\u00a0to have any contribution to the American family. I was ostracized as being this purveyor of violence and gore and bad for the culture, and I was very defensive of that because prior to Freddy I had been a very successful, mainstream, almost A-list actor and television star, but now I\u2019ve been getting this new feedback, and when I saw Adam\u2019s first draft, it just touched me so much\u2026that\u2019s really when I had to say yes \u2014 when I saw the words, the script, the story, and how sweet and how absolutely true and authentic it is.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s breaking him down emotionally, but that speaks to how much Adam not wanting her as a mom \u2014 or even saying that flippantly \u2014 how that\u2019s her biggest nightmare,\u201d McLendon-Covey explains of her scene (in her closet, where her flashy sweaters have all been replaced by Freddy\u2019s red-and-green striped ones) with Englund. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got knives for hands and you\u2019ve obviously been in a fire, but I don\u2019t know if you heard me the first time but my son says he doesn\u2019t want me as his mother and I don\u2019t know if I can handle it. When Adam first pitched it to me I was like, [grumbling], \u2018Oh, what are we gonna do? Is Freddy Krueger going to run around Jenkintown? Eh, I don\u2019t know about this.\u2019 Then I read the script and I loved it and I thought, \u2018Well that was pretty clever, she was falling asleep with the TV on, starting her dream that way\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I was just so thrilled that Robert even said yes to it.\u201d\u201cIn the very first incarnation [of the script], it was Adam that faces off with Freddy and trying not to be scared of him, but then I thought it was more interesting to have my mom say this thing, that Adam wishes Beverly wasn\u2019t the mom, and that\u2019s her worst nightmare, and then using Freddy Krueger as a way to sort through that I thought was really interesting,\u201d Goldberg explains.\u00a0But that didn\u2019t stop Giambrone, who doesn\u2019t actually share a scene with Englund, from experiencing the horror classic for himself \u2014 you know, to fully understand his real-life counterpart\u2019s true terror.\u201cI saw them while we were shooting the episode. Yeah, it definitely freaked me out. I\u2019ve never been one to handle horror films that much. I didn\u2019t quite throw up, though,\u201d Giambrone says, laughing. \u201cAfter watching, it\u2019s so creative, that movie, and it scares you \u2014 it sets this tone right off the bat. Combine that tone with The Goldbergs, I just loved it.\u201d\u201cRobert talked to the sweaters,\u201d executive producer and episode director Lew Schneider explains about a scene that didn\u2019t make it into the final cut, \u201cbecause she breaks free, and he says, \u2018What the hell is wrong with you guys?\u2019 And they [shrug]. And he says, \u2018That\u2019s what you\u2019re giving me? [A shrug?] You know how many people would kill for this job?!\u2019 My things was promising [to Robert], it\u2019s not going to be too jokey! And then the sweaters are like [shrugs]. I didn\u2019t know!\u201d Goldberg says of the improvised moment.\u00a0\u201cLew would throw out improv lines and I was a beat behind trying to catch up, and then it started to get fun, and then I saw where he was going,\u201d Englund explains. \u201cOh yeah, these are Freddy\u2019s sweaters. He\u2019s PO\u2019d!\u201dAdds Schneider, \u201cYou got a Lamborghini? Drive it around a little bit! It was fun!\u201d\u00a0\u201cWendi does the best ones,\u201d Goldberg says of dropping F-bombs every episode. Interrupts McLendon-Covey, \u201cNicer words have never been spoken.\u201d\u201cThey used to be scripted and then Wendi would do them on her own to make it funnier,\u201d Goldberg explains, \u201cSo now whenever it\u2019s scripted, we get a [safety take] without the f\u2014 because I know at some point Wendi will do a better one somewhere else. So I leave those to Wendi. And that is my mom \u2014 all she says is f\u2014 every other word. It feels the realest to Beverly.\u201d\u201cThat was all scripted, which I loved because it gave us the freedom to be a little down and dirty and also know that the punctuation and the writing where the f-bombs fell would be funny when they\u2019re bleeped,\u201d Englund recalls of the scene.\u00a0\u201cAlso, remember, it\u2019s ABC, and they hate \u2014 HATE! \u2014 the F-bombs. One, let alone three,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cIn the script Freddy was referencing an improved line Robert did in part 3, which is my favorite line, \u2018Welcome to primetime, bitch.\u2019 So Freddy referenced that and called Beverly a \u2018primetime bitch,\u2019 and the f\u2014s with the bitch and the glove, I think we just couldn\u2019t get everything, so I opted for all the f\u2014s and lost \u2018primetime bitch.'\u201d\u201cI was raised by a smother as well. She would never use the F-word, ever ever. I was in my 40s when she finally determined I do use it,\u201d McLendon-Covey says. \u201cBut my mom knows her way around a guilt letter [the focus of this season\u2019s fourth episode, \u2018Hersheypark\u2019], and my mom did exactly what Beverly did, which was, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare go see that movie. Do not see it because I do not want to clean up the aftermath of you watching a horror movie. Do not do it!\u201d Well, of course I did it, and tried to lie about it and tried to stay awake and tried not to be scared at night. So yes, [Beverly] has some outlandish methods, but I get it. And I don\u2019t know that she was wrong \u2014 sorry, Adam. Everything she does comes from a loving place. I understand her, and I love her, and I love playing her. But nothing surprises me anymore with Beverly.\u201dA series centering on \u201980s nostalgia wouldn\u2019t be complete without an episode honoring the mother of all horror movies, A Nightmare on Elm Street.
