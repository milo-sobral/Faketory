{"id": "Ariana Grande thanks her exes \u2014 by name \u2014\u00a0in new single: Listen here", "paragraph": "Ariana Grande has known heartbreak, but she must have at least a few more tears left to cry, because she\u2019s ready for the next chapter.Hot on the heels of August\u2019s Sweetener, Grande dropped a new single, \u201cthank u, next,\u201d which thanks her various former loves \u2014 including Mac Miller, who died tragically in September, and Pete Davidson, whose engagement to Grande was called off last month \u2014\u00a0and welcomes the next. The \u201cGod Is a Woman\u201d singer released the track Saturday night, right before Saturday Night Live aired.During Saturday Night Live \u2014 as the song shot up the iTunes charts and effectively blew up Twitter \u2014\u00a0Davidson addressed the breakup in an appearance on the Weekend Update. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business, and sometimes things just don\u2019t work out and that\u2019s okay,\u201d the comedian said. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful, strong person and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.\u201dGrande had teased the new song in the days leading up to its release, first tweeting \u201cthank u, next\u201d on Thursday after her ex-fianc\u00e9 Pete Davidson alluded to their breakup in a promo for this week\u2019s SNL. \u201cFor somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh,\u201d she said in a (since-deleted) tweet, then tweeted the phrase that would become the song\u2019s title.Over the course of Thursday and Friday she continued to tweet \u201cthank u, next,\u201d as well as rhymes which appeared to be (and in fact are) lyrics. She also shared images of the words and a screenshot of a song with that title playing on her phone. In responses to her fans on Twitter, Grande revealed that \u201cthank u, next\u201d would be both the title of a song and the album it would appear on, and the song would come first. She also confirmed that the new song will be the last on the album.\u201cno drags\u2026. no shade\u2026.. jus love, gratitude, acceptance, honesty, forgiveness \u2026 and growth,\u201d Grande shared in her frenzy of Twitter teases, and she wasn\u2019t kidding. Rather than being the sassy high-ponytailed kiss-off the title might suggest, \u201cthank u, next\u201d has a sincere message of gratitude. The song opens with the shoutouts: \u201cThought I\u2019d end up with Sean / But he wasn\u2019t a match / Wrote some songs about Ricky / Now I listen and laugh / Even almost got married / And for Pete,\u00a0 I\u2019m so thankful / Wish I could say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Malcolm / \u2018Cause he was an angel\u201d \u2014\u00a0referring to her ex-boyfriends Big Sean, Ricky Alvarez, Davidson, and Miller, respectively.\u201cOne taught me love / One taught me patience / And one taught me pain / Now I\u2019m so amazing / I\u2019ve loved and I\u2019ve lost / But that\u2019s not what I see / So look what I got / Look what you taught me,\u201d she croons on the track. \u201cThank you, next / Thank you, next / Thank you, next / I\u2019m so f\u2014in\u2019 grateful for my ex.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Grande\u2019s love life has explicitly inspired her music \u2014 Sweetener\u00a0includes an interlude entitled \u201cpete davidson.\u201d \u00a0Listen to \u201cthank u, next\u201d above, and check out some of the reactions from Twitter below.Don\u2019t talk to me about anything but Ariana for the next 72 hours pls.\u2014 h (@halsey) November 4, 2018what a gorgeous, strong, beautiful song about growing from love lost\u2026 thank you @ArianaGrande for this INCREDIBLE anthem!!
