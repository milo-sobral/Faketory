{"id": "Saturday Night Live recap: Jonah Hill hosts an episode dominated by midterms mania", "paragraph": "This was one of those by-the-numbers political cold opens that\u00a0Saturday Night Live\u00a0has fallen way too in the habit of. Kate McKinnon tries her best playing Laura Ingraham, the right-wing Fox News host, but as she cycles through guests covering topics of the week it soon feels like it\u2019s running on fumes. (Points to Cecily Strong, though, for committing to a sharp parody of snarly anger in her take on Judge\u00a0Jeanine Pirro.) Fortunately, things got better from there.Jonah Hill is our host this week, and he\u2019s joining the esteemed \u201cFive Timers Club\u201d \u2014 an occasion which has inspired many an Opening Monologue. This week was no different\u00a0\u2014 if, perhaps, a bit more self-aware. Hill is first greeted by Tina Fey,\u00a0SNL\u00a0head writer-turned-host extraordinaire, who tries to quell his intense enthusiasm about becoming a Five Timer a bit:\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t say it, just be it,\u201d she says.She takes him to the group\u2019s exclusive lounge, where they walk in on none other than Drew Barrymore and Candice Bergen. One unique aspect of this sketch? There are no men present other than Hill\u00a0\u2014 not even the usual suspects, like Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin. (Well, the latter was probably unavailable.) One reason why?\u00a0They\u2019re not allowed in now, because it turns out they\u2019re a bunch of horny perverts,\u201d Fey says. The female SNL\u00a0hall-of-famers then race through increasingly absurd rumors about men in the club (personal favorite: \u201cJustin Timberlake ripped a lady\u2019s top off at the Super Bowl\u201d) while Hill tries to get a jacket on his hands. When he finally does, it\u2019s a sparkly women\u2019s top. (\u201cIt\u2019s 2018,\u201d Fey quips, arguing clothing is now gender-neutral.)One last note on this opener: We get our first mention of Pete Davidson, obviously a major topic this week in the light of his highly-publicized breakup with Ariana Grande. Bergen orders a drink called the \u201cPete Davidson,\u201d and describes it:\u00a0 \u201cAll I know is, it\u2019s got a lot going on, but it gets the job done.\u201dYou know\u00a0SNL\u00a0was going to hit midterm mania hard, and in their first sketch on Tuesday\u2019s elections, they did not disappoint, putting out a digital short that hit just the right tone: weary optimism verging on nervous desperation.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a Blue Wave on the horizon and I\u2019ve never felt more\u2026 confident,\u201d Heidi Gardner\u2019s proud Democrat says in a tone that sounds anything but confident. Everything about this sketch works\u00a0\u2014 it captures how most are feeling right now with eerie satirical precision\u00a0\u2014 but highlights include Kate McKinnon\u2019s paranoid florist (who pours herself a carafe of bourbon), Aidy Bryant\u2019s mother smacking her son (Davidson) in the face for joking that everyone needs to vote on Thursday, and Beck Bennett crushing a hot coffee cop as he tries to contain his anxiety. The repeated line in the short is \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win.\u201d Heh.So continues a heavily political\u00a0SNL: Colin Jost and Michael Che leaned right into ongoing conversations about voting, potentially flipping the House, and key races going on around the country. Some highlights:Then came the man of the hour, Pete Davidson, to weigh in on a few of the candidates. \u201cAfter I had to move back in with my mom, I started paying attention,\u201d he began, alluding to his recent breakup for the first time on the show. \u201cI realized there are some really gross people running for office.\u201d He goes after various (mostly Republican) politicians, and gets in some great jabs,\u00a0including at congressional candidate Greg Pence (yes, that\u00a0Pence): \u201cThis is a picture of him watching that episode of This Is Us where Jack dies.\u201dThe biggest takeaway from Weekend Update, however\u00a0\u2014 really the whole episode of\u00a0SNL\u00a0is\u00a0\u2014 is how Davidson closed things out. Many thought he\u2019d address his split from Grande in a more joking manner, but he instead struck a serious, sincere tone.\u00a0\u201cI know some of you are curious about the breakup,\u201d he began. \u201cBut the truth is, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business and sometimes things just don\u2019t work out. And that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s a wonderful, strong person and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.\u201dLater in the segment,\u00a0Melissa Villase\u00f1or effectively played a \u201cteen\u00a0Law and Order\u201d suspect left to review YA books like\u00a0The Hate U Give, and Kenan Thompson reprised his popular David Ortiz role as the Red Sox continue to celebrate their World Series win.Ever try HuckaPM? Aidy Bryant\u2019s brash turn as Sarah Huckabee Sanders tends to be a bit hit-and-miss, depending on the quality of material she\u2019s given, but she got a fun digital short to work in this week. Compared to the dry Cold Open and a relatively Trump-free Weekend Update, this is definitely where the show\u2019s commentary on the presidency hit sharpest. The oft-asked question, \u201cHow does Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u201d sleep at night?\u201d gets answered here with a special medication, all for the country\u2019s Press Secretary. It\u2019s just a little stronger than what you might be used to.Kate McKinnon can pretty much do anything\u00a0\u2014 even deliver nonsensical monologues as a driver\u2019s ed teacher who\u2019s just fallen to the floor, and is left to meditate on the meaning of the universe as she addresses her (totally confused) students from down below. The actress gets to show off her range and play brilliantly off her students\u2019 deadpan\u00a0\u2014 including Jonah Hill, who\u2019s gone mostly unmentioned in this recap. Why? His work here is pretty unmemorable. But \u201cTeacher Day\u201d serves as a nice reminder that he\u2019s often funniest when he underplays. This\u00a0SNL\u00a0was no exception.Related content:"}
