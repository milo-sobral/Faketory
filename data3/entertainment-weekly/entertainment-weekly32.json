{"id": "The Conners ratings decline for second episode", "paragraph": "As expected, the second week of ABC\u2019s Roseanne spin-off dipped in the ratings. The big question last week was: By how much?Tuesday night\u2019s\u00a0The Conners had 7.9 million viewers and a 1.7 rating among adults 18-49, down 26 percent in the demo from last week\u2019s premiere. That\u2019s a bit more than your typical second-week drop for a \u201cnew\u201d series, but also far from the plummet that some had predicted.One big factor was that Fox had Game 1 of the World Series on last night. But it\u2019s debatable how much of The Conners drop should be attributed to the sports competition. CBS\u2019 entire lineup was actually unchanged in the ratings compared to last week, and NBC shows were barely impacted \u2014 with The Voice and This Is Us only dropping a tenth of a point each (and New Amsterdam at 10 p.m. actually improving). The CW\u2019s lineup likewise improved. ABC\u2019s lineup, however, softened across the board after The Conners dipped at 8 p.m.Still, The Conners was the second-highest rated entertainment series Tuesday night, behind only\u00a0This Is Us (8.8 million, 2.2 rating), and a win is a win.Speaking of which, here\u2019s our rundown of fall TV\u2019s 10 biggest winners and losers (so far).Accurate World Series ratings are not yet in, but the game delivered 12.6 million viewers and a 3.4 demo rating in the fast nationals, which are not adjusted for live coverage. This is roughly on par with last year."}
