{"id": "At NewFest, an LGBTQ film festival becomes a form of resistance", "paragraph": "For the 30th anniversary of NewFest, New York\u2019s LGBTQ film festival, executive director Robert Kushner began his opening night remarks with a nod back to 1988, when the organization was founded. \u201cDuring the height of the AIDS crisis, a festival like NewFest was critical,\u201d he told the SVA Theatre audience in Chelsea. \u201cOur community was being torn apart both by illness and in the media. We were craving safe spaces and true representations of who we were. It\u2019s at this time when our lives were being defined by a plague and our humanity was being overshadowed.\u201dIn 2018, the culture has changed, but the value remains.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s almost like running this [festival] is a form of resistance in its own way,\u201d Yen Tan, director of the opening night film 1985, tells EW.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a political charge to it with how people are talking about gay festivals and the importance of gay films and representation and all these things.\u201dIt\u2019s a resistance that feels like a response to a government that doesn\u2019t support queer people and an industry that doesn\u2019t always support queer stories.The theater erupted in boos when Kushner referenced the\u00a0New York Times report about President Trump\u2019s intention to legally write the transgender community out of existence. Dennis Williams, HBO\u2019s SVP of Corporate Social Responsibility & Corporate Affairs, then followed with a story of how his colleagues evacuated the Time Warner building in Manhattan over a suspicious package related to a string of pipe bomb threats mailed by a now-arrested pro-Trump zealot.For a community under attack, visibility is often the best defense against discrimination and misinformation, but this visibility can be an uphill battle. In Hollywood, LGBTQ representation is still excluded from most major studio releases. In the indie landscape, queer voices are fighting to be heard by financiers and distributors. NewFest, though it lacks the funding of a Sundance or Cannes, gives this visibility to a community still craving it.1985 (out now) hits select theaters in New York and Los Angeles, but at NewFest, it held the prime opening night spot. Rafiki, a film from director\u00a0Wanuri Kahiu, was banned in Kenya over its openly LGBTQ content, but it screened in late October as the International Centerpiece. Trans stories like Coby (a documentary about the day-to-day of the titular trans\u00a0paramedic), Bixa Travesty (the story of black Brazilian trans singer\u00a0Linn da Quebrada), and Man Made (about trans bodybuilders) also shared the programming spotlight.It\u2019s a platform and a community that\u00a0Desiree\u00a0Akhavan, the director behind\u00a0Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz starrer The Miseducation of Cameron Post, calls crucial for filmmakers trying to plant their footing in the industry. \u201cI\u00a0think it helps a lot in the early days of your career when no one really wants to take a risk,\u201d she says of LGBTQ film festivals. \u201cQueer festivals, queer programmers, queer critics champion the work they see in a way that others don\u2019t have the same interest in.\u201dAs a first-time feature filmmaker with 2015\u2019s Appropriate Behavior, Akhavan started developing\u00a0the concept for her new television series called\u00a0The Bisexual\u00a0\u2014 a stereotype-knocking story of a New Yorker navigating her newfound bisexuality with help from a wingman. She initially pitched it to American-based networks after the press tour for Appropriate Behavior but found she couldn\u2019t get work.\u201cIt was funny,\u201d she says, \u201cI went to a lot of different networks and the vibe was always, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, we already have a female-driven show\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, we already have a queer show and we don\u2019t want to cannibalize the business with a show that will be in that direct marketplace.'\u201dAkhavan had more luck selling\u00a0The Bisexual\u00a0in the U.K., mainly because the industry there was financially different.\u00a0Akhavan, who now lives in London,\u00a0made her way overseas with the intent of temporarily working with a writing partner on new material. She found the budgets were typically less than U.S. productions, so the risk of a flop was less.\u00a0\u201cWhen I got to London, suddenly every conversation I had was different,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What chances do you want to take?\u2019 \u2018What are your ideas?\u2019 \u2018Where do you want to go with this?\u2019 \u2018How do you want to make this unlike anything else I\u2019ve seen?\u2019 And it was very easy to sell [The Bisexual].\u201dIn October, NewFest welcomed the gestating series for its U.S. premiere. Debuting the first two episodes at the festival before heading to its new home on Hulu, Akhavan now sees NewFest as a means of returning home to her LGBTQ family, especially in an industry landscape that didn\u2019t initially accept the concept.\u00a0\u201cI know I\u2019m sharing the content with the people who I specifically made it for, with the people who are like me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more emotional.\u201dWith LGBTQ festivals also comes a systemic dilemma that Tan, personally, has difficulty reconciling.\u00a0When a film premieres at a Sundance or Cannes, it brings a \u201clegitimacy\u201d to the work. Films that primarily go to LGBTQ festivals are labeled as niche and the industry often treats them as such in terms of financing and distribution.\u00a0Tan doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a \u201cblack-and-white sort of thing,\u201d but one with \u201ca lot of nuances to the way people make decisions.\u201d Trying to reconcile it all, however,\u00a0\u201cis just a road to more frustration.\u201d\u201cI believe they call it ghettoization of the queer film marketplace,\u201d Akhavan remarks. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely aware of the fact that you\u2019re a second-class citizen in a lot of film buyers\u2019 eyes.\u00a0I would like to reinvent what a queer film means. I think that can be something mainstream. I think it\u2019s about having the courage to make your content and let someone label it however they want and then to re-appropriate that label.\u201dThe development of\u00a0Boy Erased, an adaptation of Garrard Conley\u2019s memoir on conversion therapy, was already a different experience for Joel Edgerton, who came with connections in the industry as an actor and previous experience as a director on\u00a0The Gift. But he, too, was aware of the challenges of fighting that niche label.\u201c\u2018LGBTQ stories\u2019 is not a genre,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just happens to be a character or a backdrop or a certain part of the environment to a story, but how could people call it a genre?\u201dHis response was to get as many \u201cbig-hitting actors\u201d attached to Boy Erased as possible before approaching potential buyers, \u201cthen finance would be unquestionable,\u201d he notes. So he brought Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman, and Russell Crowe to the table, which sparked a competition amongst distributors.\u00a0\u201cThey would otherwise be like, \u2018Eh, we don\u2019t know about this,'\u201d Edgerton predicts.The film has now become more mainstream as it gets a nationwide release, starting with New York and Los Angeles this weekend. At the same time, Tan recognizes the competition that occurs between LGBTQ films in the eyes of distributors \u2014 similar to\u00a0Akhavan\u2019s feedback on The Bisexual from American networks. \u201cThere\u2019s always this weird idea of, there\u2019s not enough space for all of us,\u201d he says.Other filmmakers, especially those who identify as LGBTQ, don\u2019t always have the same resources as Edgerton, which makes film festivals like NewFest crucial. It gave\u00a0Lisa Cholodenko\u00a0the support she needed as a budding filmmaker to launch her career. More than two decades later, after directing The Kids Are All Right and episodes of NBC\u2019s The Slap and HBO\u2019s Here and Now, she came back to NewFest to commemorate the 20th anniversary of High Art with actress Patricia Clarkson \u2014 a film lifted up by NewFest in 1998.\u201cI think we have this fantasy that we\u2019ve [LGBTQ people] assimilated and we\u2019ve folded into the larger culture and I think that\u2019s not true,\u201d Cholodenko says. \u201cI think that\u2019s always been born out in different ways, unfortunately. So I think having a traditional place at home for these films is great, and I think we\u2019ve gone through many cycles: the AIDS crisis to what came next to marriage equality to Trump to this to that. There\u2019s always a need to come home and have your people.\u201dRelated content:"}
