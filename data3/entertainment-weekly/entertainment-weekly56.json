{"id": "Corey Stoll reflects on the beginning of\u00a0House of Cards\u00a0\u2014 and Peter Russo's 'beautiful' ending", "paragraph": "Over its deadly run, House of Cards has become synonymous with the abrupt killing off of major characters. But, like with everything, there has to be a first, and for Netflix\u2019s original flagship series, it was Peter Russo, memorably played by Corey Stoll.From the beginning, Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were the clear leads of creator Beau Willimon\u2019s series, but Russo and Kate Mara\u2019s Zoe Barnes quickly emerged as two of the most interesting House of Cards characters. But Stoll\u2019s memorable run didn\u2019t even last a full season, considering his character learned the hard way to never get involved with the Underwoods. In the midst of a drunken spiral, Russo decides he needed to come clean, which was bad news for Frank (Spacey), so after driving a passed out Russo home, the ruthless politician left the car running and closed the garage behind him, leaving Russo to die in what would be deemed a suicide.Now, with House of Cards set to return for one last season (without Spacey, who was fired due to multiple sexual misconduct accusations), EW talked with Stoll about why he initially was resistant to the Russo role, the character\u2019s shocking death, and his skepticism about later returning for a cameo.ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What appealed to you about Peter Russo and House of Cards when you were first introduced to the project?\nCOREY STOLL: It\u2019s funny, I didn\u2019t really get it at first. When I first auditioned for it, I thought it was sort of a fun, goofy guy, another stereotypical, arrogant grownup frat boy in a suit. But I auditioned and then didn\u2019t hear anything about it for a few months and I just kept on going back to that role, I just kept on thinking about him. I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but there was something about him that I really just felt like I had to play. And I almost never feel this, this sort of sense that I was the only person who could play this role, and I sort of hounded my agents to make sure I got back in the room with David Fincher. There was just something about the character\u2019s combination of strength and weakness. It\u2019s so rare to be able to play all of those colors, certainly in a supporting role.Why do you think that Peter has stuck with so many fans? He lasted just 11 episodes, which basically equates to only one-sixth of the entire series. Do you think it\u2019s for a lot of the same reasons that he stuck with you?\n                He\u2019s somebody who has a really compelling arc. He starts off as shallow and entitled as you can get and is almost instantly brought down, and then builds himself back up. And I think his is death really, truly surprising. It comes at a point in the storytelling where you feel like he\u2019s just sort of coming into his own. I\u2019m only guessing what an audience feels, but the audience first feels like they sold him too short, because I think as soon as you see him, you go, \u201cOh, this guy\u2019s a liar and shallow,\u201d and then you see the spark of someone with some real integrity and hope, and you go on that journey and it\u2019s cut short.You lead me perfectly into the shocking end of Peter. How did you find out that his story was going to conclude like that? Having it take place in the first season, did you know going in that this would be one and done for you?\n                Yeah, I knew it was a one season deal. I can\u2019t remember if I knew exactly how he died from the beginning, but I definitely knew that that was the plan.So what were your thoughts when you found out how it was going to be executed?\n                I thought it was beautiful. I was definitely attached to Peter by the time that we had to film those scenes. But I also knew how lucky I was to have this self-contained story. Whether it\u2019s conscious or not, I think when you\u2019re doing a TV show, there is something that you hold back because you feel like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep the story of this character going for maybe years and years.\u201d Knowing that the end was coming and coming soon, I really felt released from any sort of restraint in every scene, I\u2019d say all the way from the beginning.What was it like when it came to filming Peter\u2019s death? Pretty emotional?\n                It was. I put a lot into the character and the episode or two that leads up to his death, where he really falls off the wagon and is suicidal, were very intense things to shoot. The actual shooting of the death was very technical, a lot of it was just figuring out how to work the electronics on the Chrysler 300 that I was sitting in and questioning if I\u2019m found in the passenger seat won\u2019t that make it obvious that it wasn\u2019t suicide, and then someone did some quick Googling and we found out that it actually does happen. So it was technical, and also Peter was just so drunk and high at that point that the pain had gone and he was sort of in a haze. Definitely the most painful scene to shoot was when he calls his children.Peter became the first big casualty on a show that would become synonymous with killing off characters. Do you take a little pride in being the one who started it all?\n                Sure [laughs]. I don\u2019t know; I mean, it\u2019s always good to be the first. And I do think the impact of mine and Kate Mara\u2019s character\u2019s deaths were so strong because we were set up as the two other lead protagonists. We were set up to be long-term characters\u2026 and not so much.Speaking of Kate, you came back and did a cameo from beyond the grave in season 4, so what was it like to pick Peter back up after having felt like you put him to bed so beautifully?\n                I was very skeptical about it, because I had felt that the story was so well-told and completely told, and, exactly, I had put him to bed. I\u2019ll be honest, I did it because [creator] Beau Willimon asked me to and I felt that I owed it to him because he had written such a beautiful role for me that had frankly done so much for my career. I felt if this is how he wants the character to come back then I\u2019m willing to oblige. But I was definitely nervous about doing anything to lessen the impact of what was already filmed. And I\u2019m happy with the way it went because it\u2019s so abstractive and so unexpected that I felt like it succeeded in continuing the spirit in which we had filmed the first season.Any final thoughts on Peter and the series as a whole?\n                Peter was an unique experience for me on film. I had been able to find characters onstage that served as sort of vessels for my psyche in the way that Peter was, but never on film and television. There\u2019s something unique about him where I felt I was able to share my weakness and my strength. There was a completeness about that character that was very satisfying and cathartic to play. I think every actor is searching for roles that allow them to show a secret side of themselves \u2014 not that I share those particular addictions that Peter had, I don\u2019t. He was a vessel that fit perfectly for me and so the fact that other people could react to that and react positively to that means a lot to me.The final season of House of Cards begins streaming on Friday.Related content:"}
