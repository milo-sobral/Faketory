{"id": "Bill Maher trashes comic book culture after Stan Lee\u2019s death, sparks outrage", "paragraph": "Bill Maher kicked the Marvel Wasp nest with a baffling post published to his\u00a0blog this week.The HBO late-night host wrote a response to the death of\u00a0Stan Lee in which he criticized those mourning the comic book giant, trashed modern comic book culture, and suggested: \u201cDonald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important.\u201d Naturally, it was not received well by all.\u201cThe guy who created Spider-Man and the Hulk has died, and America is in mourning. Deep, deep mourning for a man who inspired millions to, I don\u2019t know, watch a movie, I guess,\u201d Maher began the post, which he titled \u201cAdulting.\u201d \u201cSomeone on Reddit posted, \u2018I\u2019m so incredibly grateful I lived in a world that included Stan Lee.\u2019 Personally, I\u2019m grateful I lived in a world that included oxygen and trees, but to each his own.\u201d\u201cNow, I have nothing against comic books \u2014 I read them now and then when I was a kid and I was all out of Hardy Boys,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the assumption everyone had back then, both the adults and the kids, was that comics were for kids, and when you grew up you moved on to big-boy books without the pictures.\u201dMaher went on to write how, in the past 20 years, \u201cadults decided they didn\u2019t have to give up kid stuff\u201d and \u201cpretended comic books were actually sophisticated literature,\u201d while\u00a0\u201csome dumb people got to be professors by writing theses with titles like Otherness and Heterodoxy in the Silver Surfer.\u201d\u201cAnd now,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhen adults are forced to do grown-up things like buy auto insurance, they call it \u2018adulting,\u2019 and act like it\u2019s some giant struggle.\u201dMaher concluded his blog post by claiming our culture hasn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily gotten stupider,\u201d we\u2019re just \u201cusing our smarts on stupid stuff.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge stretch to suggest that Donald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important.\u201dReps for Maher did not respond to EW\u2019s request for further comment.\u00a0HBO declined to comment, emphasizing \u201cthese blogs are Bill\u2019s voice.\u201dAdmirers of Lee, fans of comic books, and comic book creators seemed stunned and angered by these comments, especially as they were written in connection to Lee, who passed away at the age of 95 days earlier.\u201cBill Maher dismissed an entire storytelling medium?\u00a0Wow. He\u2019s so highbrow,\u201d Tom Taylor, best-selling write behind DC\u2019s Injustice: Gods Among Us, tweeted. \u201cHis brow is so high, there\u2019s probably less room for a mind.\u201dFolks like Spider-Gwen and Southern Bastards\u2018 co-creator Jason Latour were more brief. \u201cNewsflash: Bill Maher is still a dips\u2014,\u201d he wrote.Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m English but seeing some stuff on line about a blog post from this Bill Maher bloke trashing comics and Stan Lee. So I\u2019m just wondering, who the badgery-Christ is Bill Maher? Other than an arsehole, obviously.\u2014 BRYAN HITCH (@THEBRYANHITCH) November 16, 2018I also notice that people who shit on comics as irrelevant don't usually read them or haven't since they were kids many decades ago. Kind of like hating opera, even though you can't name a single one you've ever seen or listened to.\u2014 Darick Robertson (@DarickR) November 17, 2018One need only look at how comics are dominating every field of screen entertainment, and still growing, to prove that the ideas born of comics in the last 40 years, are shaping the modern Television and movie landscape.\u2014 Darick Robertson (@DarickR) November 17, 2018Lol. #billmaher Just upset because nobody will mourn him when he dies.\u2014 Scott Snyder (@Ssnyder1835) November 17, 2018Bill Maher dismissed an entire storytelling medium?Wow. He's so highbrow.His brow is so high, there's probably less room for a mind.\u2014 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) November 17, 2018Newsflash: Bill Maher is still a dipshit.\u2014 Jason Latour (@jasonlatour) November 17, 2018Correction: An earlier version of this article described Maher\u2019s site as his \u201cReal Time blog,\u201d but a rep for HBO emphasizes \u201cthese blogs are Bill\u2019s voice.\u201dRelated content:"}
