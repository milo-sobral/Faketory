I was like, \u2018Heck, that\u2019s the way I talk!'\u201dBut, as an actual eighth grader at the time, she was able to make certain suggestions to the twentysomething writer-director, like telling him to switch over Kayla\u2019s direct messages from Facebook to Instagram. \u201cNobody uses Facebook anymore!\u201dRelated content:"}
