And that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s a wonderful, strong person and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.\u201dDavidson previously used his\u00a0SNL\u00a0platform to address the breakup more obliquely, mock-\u201cproposing\u201d to the episode\u2019s musical guest, Maggie Rogers, in a promotion for the episode. Shortly after it went online Thursday,\u00a0Grande seemingly tweeted out a response on Twitter: \u201cFor somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh,\u201d Grande tweeted. (The tweet has since been deleted.)On Oct. 14, news broke that Davidson and Grande\u2019s whirlwind romance was coming to an end, and that the pair had called off their engagement.Earlier in his \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment on Saturday, Davidson quipped, \u201cAfter I had to move back in with my mom, I started paying attention [to politics].\u201dEarly reactions on social media praised Davidson for the sober, respectful tone he struck in his first official comments on the breakup.Whoa.
