Take a trip down nostalgia lane and remind yourself of the moments that kept you up at night.\u00a0Look, Stuck in the Suburbs isn\u2019t a horror movie, but I just wanted an excuse to show the clip of Taran Killam (as pop star Jordan Cahill) being flat-out terrible at pretending to play the guitar. Move your left hand, Taran! His fake playing is so bad, it\u2019s a little scary.The scariest thing about this tired retrod of the franchise was the recasting.\u00a0The twin witches (get it?) had a vibe that was less \u201cscary\u201d and more \u201cfortune teller/astrology.\u201dThe third film in the franchise featured the monsters from Halloweentown going to a human high school. Sure, fitting in can be hard, but the movie wasn\u2019t actually anything to keep us up at night.\u00a0Aly Michalka played a teen trying to win a contest for teenage reality show tv producers (lol) when she discovers a magician whose powers are\u00a0rEaL.\u00a0Yes, that is Frank Langella. Yes, that is Disney hunk and young Dana\u2019s crush, Johnny Pacar.\u00a0The first of the classic DCOMs featured a group of kids who discover a real mummy (named Harold). The mummy is gross and actually pretty scary.\u00a0The Boogeyman starts framing a young girl for various acts of vandalism, but what\u2019s scarier here is the idea that your childhood imaginary friends are real and no one will believe you.\u00a0\u201cHalloween is\u00a0cool.\u201d\u00a0With Debbie Reynolds as the matriarchal head witch in charge,\u00a0Halloweentown\u00a0makes us wish that a town where everything was spooky was real. The town itself, not too scary. But Kalabar\u2026. *shudders.*\u00a0A teen wins a contest that brings his family to the high-tech home of their dreams. Waking up to a personalized concerto? Instant gourmet meals? Pre-Alexa voice commands? It sounds too good to be true because it is. It\u2019s not a Halloween movie, but it is truly terrifying when their house turns against them and traps them inside.\u00a0Is that Mickey Rooney? (Yes, it is.) The plot turned out to be pretty Scooby Doo, but there is something to the idea of a ghost haunting a movie theater.Another non-Halloween movie that freaked me the hell out as a kid: Ryan Merriman played an Irish-American who can\u2019t control his transformation into a tiny, foot-tall leprechaun. NIGHTMARE.The hot dad from The Nanny\u00a0is a vampire! It\u2019s a mainstay in kids movies that the kids are smarter than the adults, but it\u2019s uniquely horrifying when your own mother is vulnerable and you\u2019re helpless.Truly, the scariest DCOM of all. Maybe it was a meh sequel, and there was probably no need for two more, but Kalabar\u2019s revenge was transforming all humans into their Halloween costumes, and we get an even scarier version of parents in danger: parents helplessly transforming into grotesque monsters. That frog-monster mask haunts my dreams to this day.\u00a0Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs) ran the gamut from silly to self-serious, but there were plenty that traumatized young viewers with nightmares.
