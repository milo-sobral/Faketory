{"id": "Parks and Recreation's Li'l Sebastian crosses over to The Good Place", "paragraph": "Of course Li\u2019l Sebastian is in the Good Place.The lil\u2019 horse that was anything but lil\u2019 on Parks and Recreation seems to have officially galloped over to\u00a0The Good Place, marking the latest Easter egg crossover between the two NBC comedies.D\u2019Arcy Carden posed next to the Pawnee celebrity and gave a classic Janet greeting, \u201chi.\u201dAnd just to confirm that this really is the same mini horse with an honorary degree from Notre Dame, the official Parks and Recreation Instagram account shared Carden\u2019s photo with the caption, \u201c1 like = 1 candle in the wind.\u201d That means (at the time this article went to press) there are 25,971 candles in the wind.This does bring up a lot of questions, like, if Li\u2019l Sebastian is in the Good Place \u2014 which we know is really a cover for the Bad Place \u2014 does that mean Li\u2019l\u00a0Sebastian is in the Bad Place? Say it ain\u2019t so!Reps for NBC did not immediately respond to EW\u2019s request for more information.hi. pic.twitter.com/uX52o1vHuo\u2014 D'Arcy Carden (@DarcyCarden) November 9, 2018The Good Place featured a number of Parks and Recreation Easter eggs throughout all three seasons. It was easy for creator\u00a0Mike Schur to do, as he spearheaded both shows.The name\u00a0Bjoern Lerpiss, who appeared on multiple episodes of Parks and Rec, showed up on a leaderboard in season 1 of The Good Place. The heavenly series also featured the\u00a0Swanson Safe Company, which created the safe in which\u00a0Manny Jacinto\u2019s Jason suffocated, and ads for Dennis Feinstein\u2019s eau de toilette Glyde and a Jean-Ralphio champagne.Then, in the third episode of season 3, Eleanor and the gang went to\u00a0the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet, which featured a\u00a0Paunch Burger on the menu.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly for fun,\u201d Schur previously told EW\u00a0of all these references. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to do \u2014 and because sometimes you need a magazine ad on the back of a magazine, and it\u2019s easier to come up with a fake product and put it in there than it is to clear a real product. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really trying to say that at some point anyone\u2019s going to be walking down the street and run into Ron Swanson. But Parks and Rec\u00a0had an intense fan base, and we always tried to lay in fun Easter eggs in Parks and Rec for various people, for people who were fans of sabermetric baseball statistics, so [this] is along the same lines. These are little things we like to lay in just for people to enjoy \u2014 and to find on a little Easter egg hunt. It\u2019s 99 percent for that reason.\u201dFor the record, EW\u2019s Dan Snierson definitely predicted\u00a0\u201cLi\u2019l Sebastian could be galloping around the Good Place.\u201d Just saying.Related content:"}
