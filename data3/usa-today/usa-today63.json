To get victory lane, that\u2019s our goal. That\u2019s how you control your destiny the most, instead of counting fingers and toes what you need to do.\u201d.@KevinHarvick is going #4TheCup.Harvick wins at @TXMotorSpeedway. He'll try to earn his second @NASCAR Cup Series championship in two weeks at @HomesteadMiami! #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/1lpnuTnfUxLast November\u2019s victory was Harvick\u2019s first at this track. He finished second here in April after an unscheduled pit stop ruined another dominant run.\u00a0\"We've loved it here since they repaved it,\" said Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers.\u00a0\"We had great race cars last year. The spring hurt us a little bit. We had such a great race car, and we were able to bring the same car back with some updates and do great again tonight. It's an awesome feeling.\"Joey Logano, who finished third, secured his chance to compete for the championship\u00a0at the Nov. 18 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway with a victory at\u00a0Martinsville Speedway one week ago. The driver he spun out to win that race, Martin Truex Jr., was among the Round of 8 drivers who struggled with penalties.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Truex rebounded early in the race on the 1.5-mile oval after he started in the back of the field because of an engine change. He was sent back again around the midpoint of the race after he was penalized for rolling\u00a0through more than three pit stalls on a pit stop. \u00a0After another drive through the field and a timely caution, Truex rebounded again to finish ninth, good enough to drop just one spot in the playoff standings to third.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, God is testing us,\" Truex said.\u00a0\"There\u2019s no question. Just a tough day. Overall, a good day. Luckily we were able to get up front and get some stage points in the first two stages.Truex said the team is \"in decent shape going to Phoenix.\"\"We\u2019ll go there and race hard again and see what we can do,\" Truex added.\u00a0Kyle Busch, who entered the race atop the playoff standings, was hit with a speeding violation on pit road and had to make an unscheduled pit stop before the midpoint of the race. He spent much of the rest of the race trying to get back on the lead lap en route to finishing 17th. \u00a0Busch enters next Sunday's race second to only Harvick in the standings.\u00a0Clint Bowyer\u2019s chances of making the Championship 4 dimmed when his car, which started on the front row, rode up the track and clipped Denny Hamlin on the first turn of the first lap, a collision that sent both to the pits. That led to an unscheduled pit stop to address the damage that collision caused along with a penalty later in the race because one of his crew members was caught sitting on the wall \u2014 a violation of pit lane rules.\u00a0Bowyer never recoverd and finished 26th. That sets up a must-win situation for the Stewart-Haas Racing driver, who has led only 22 laps in 26 starts in Phoenix. His average finish is 18.4 with only two top-5 finishes, the last coming a decade ago.Aric Almirola and Chase Elliott \u00ad\u2014 two others drivers who made the Round of 8 \u2014 also almost certainly need a victory next Sunday to gain entry to the Championship 4.NASCAR announced three drivers, in addition to Truex, would start at the back of the field just before the start of the race: Almirola (unapproved body modifications), William Byron (failed inspection) and seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson (failed inspection).But there was one issue \u2013\u2013 Johnson was penalized by NASCAR by mistake. The rules for Texas stated cars could fail inspection three times, not the the more typical two times. Johnson only failed twice, a mistake that was not announced until more than 100 laps into the race.\u00a0 \u00a0Johnson, who spun out Hendrick Motorsports teammate Byron on Lap 98, rebounded to lead briefly twice as race as cars shuffled into the pits. He finished 15th, partly due to NASCAR issuing a pass-through penalty after officials caught a crew member hopping into the pit box too soon.Follow USA TODAY Sports' A.J.
