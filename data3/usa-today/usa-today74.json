Thank God for Danny Rubenstein, he told me how to take it off. They would see seen and be like, \u2018I know you saw it.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0And I was like, \u2018No I didn\u2019t.\u2019 But they were like, \u2018Dude, screengrab. You saw my text.\u2019 And I was like dead silent.\u00a0But If there is a text from Brock I\u2019ll probably respond to him and tell him I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u00a0Take a lesson here from D.C. and check your phone right now to make sure your read receipts are off.Because life is all about avoiding people but not letting them now that you are avoiding them.Daniel Cormier, Derrick Lewis, UFC, UFC 230, MMA\n\n\t\t\t\tCharles Barkley on the real reason the Warriors suspended Draymond Green\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHarvard loses TD after player flips off opponent while running into the end zone\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReport: Here's the Draymond Green insult of Kevin Durant that got him suspended\t\t\t\n\nNovember 17, 2018 8:25 pm \n\u00b7\n\nMichelle R.
