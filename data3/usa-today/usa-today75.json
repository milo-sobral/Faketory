Well, Rinaldi explained after the fight just what\u2019s wrong with that gnarly digit:So\u2026 he bit me. No, he didn\u2019t (laughs). Dirt bike wreck 15 years ago so it\u2019s not special. It breaks every now and then so it hurts.It\u2019s been like this for 15 years, or 16 now, I\u2019m getting old.\u00a0I should have (shown it off) during the interview, just like, \u2018Joe Rogan it\u2019s great to see you,\u2019 (and lift it up) like a Ricky Bobby thing.\u00a0He also told a funny story about the first time his wife saw his busted finger.My wife and I were on like our first or second date at like Steak and Shake after a movie or something \u2013 don\u2019t judge me \u2013 and I saw her see it and stare at it for a second and I was like come on, man. And then I hid it and she saw it again later and I was like, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s crooked.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Mine is too!\u2019 Her left ring finger is crooked \u2013 not as much as mine \u2013 but it\u2019s crooked. She slammed it in a sliding door when she was young so it was love at first sight. It was meant to be.What a love story.
