Because he thinks the fans are too close. He told SI\u2019s Tom Verducci after Tuesday\u2019s Game 1:\u201cBrutal. Pretty brutal,\u201d said Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt, making his first trip to the Fens since 2010. Not much has changed. The rubber of the pitching mound in the visitors\u2019 bullpen is but three feet from the bleacher seats. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why baseball allows it. You\u2019ve got the rubber right there and people literally standing over you.\u201dHe\u2019s not wrong about the closeness of the fans, check out this photo of a more crowded Fenway when the Yankees were in town. They are really close:(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)But come on, what\u2019s really gonna happen? Some people are gonna say some inappropriate things? Try to get you off your game? That\u2019s called home-field advantage, bud. Welcome to Boston.I\u2019d try to blame his take on millennials being too soft but Honeycutt is 64 years old so that can be it.But in all the years of baseball being played at the cathedral that is Fenway, there have close to zero incidents with fans and the bullpens.Sure the fans are close. That\u2019s what makes Fenway so great.And I\u2019m guessing the fans may be a little more vocal now.2018 World Series, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, MLB\n\n\t\t\t\tCharles Barkley on the real reason the Warriors suspended Draymond Green\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHarvard loses TD after player flips off opponent while running into the end zone\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tReport: Here's the Draymond Green insult of Kevin Durant that got him suspended\t\t\t\n\nNovember 17, 2018 8:25 pm \n\u00b7\n\nMichelle R.
