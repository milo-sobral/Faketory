The party continued after the game, where his father, mother and two sisters watched him answer questions.\"When you're a kid, you dream about playing college football, and you dream about scoring touchdowns and throwing it and running it,\" Miles said. \"For it all to happen at the end and for your first throw to be a touchdown like that, it's pretty awesome.\"MILESTONE PERFORMANCEAdams became the 10th player in FCS history to pass for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the same season.
