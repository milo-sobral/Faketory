Warren/AP)Washington, D.C., remains hopelessly gridlocked on the existential threat posed by human-induced climate change. But in Washington state, there's an opportunity to do something about it on Election Day.There, for the first time in the United States, voters will choose whether to tax carbon emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere.While one state's success in reducing its carbon footprint will not save the planet, passage of Initiative 1631 on Tuesday would\u00a0show that people who are rightly concerned about global warming are willing to act\u00a0\u2014 and demonstrate\u00a0that carbon taxes don't translate into economic ruination.About 20 percent of global emissions are already impacted by carbon pricing. Initiative\u00a01631 would be the first greenhouse gas tax levied by ballot initiative. It employs\u00a0real-world compromise, exempting the state's huge aerospace industry and Washington's largest polluter, a coal-fired plant in Centralia\u00a0that\u00a0is already slated to phase out coal by\u00a02025.OPPOSING VIEW: Washingtonians, reject Initiative 1631Even with these exceptions, the ballot measure\u00a0would target 80 percent of the state's greenhouse gas pollution. The fee ($15 per ton of carbon dioxide, starting in 2020)\u00a0would rise for inflation and, for\u00a0large emitters, by $2 per year through 2035.Seventy percent of the money\u00a0raised would be invested in\u00a0clean energy projects;\u00a025 percent\u00a0would go to protect\u00a0water and forests. And the measure would provide\u00a0tens of millions of dollars for communities and workers hurt by the\u00a0tax.\u00a0Unsurprisingly, opposition to 1631 is strongest from the oil and gas industry, which has ponied up most of $26 million that has been raised to fight the initiative. It remains unclear how much of the fee\u00a0for major emitters will be passed along to consumers. Estimates are\u00a0that costs will increase about 13 cents a\u00a0gallon at the gas pump and 18 cents a gallon for home heating oil.That's not chump change, but the whole point of a carbon tax\u00a0\u2014 and the reason why a recent landmark, United Nations climate report highlighted the centrality of the concept\u00a0\u2014 is to prevent\u00a0industries that burn coal, oil and natural gas from continuing to\u00a0use the earth's atmosphere as a free waste dump.Taxing carbon\u00a0pollution is a simple, market-based means of curbing the\u00a0practice and making renewable energy sources more competitive.Other state ballots are populated with environmental ideas that simply mandate change, such as Arizona's Proposition 127 and Nevada's Question 6, which would require utilities to produce at least half of their electricity from renewable sources.Those are blunt-edged approaches. Far better is a\u00a0market-based alternative such as\u00a0a carbon tax that levels the playing field so green-energy sources can gain traction. It's why Republican elder statesmen such as James Baker, Henry Paulson and George Shultz last year endorsed a national carbon tax, the proceeds of which\u00a0would be rebated to consumers.Washington's\u00a0ballot measure could offer a worthwhile template for other states and \u2014\u00a0who knows? \u2014\u00a0maybe one day for\u00a0lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\u00a0To those who argue that\u00a0we can't afford to do anything about climate disruption, the only answer is that we can't afford not to.USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
