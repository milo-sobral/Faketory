By the next day, an examination had revealed the animal had been shot.The killing was \u201cbrutal, senseless act of aggression\" likely carried out by a boater Wallerstein said. Based on his knowledge of dolphin behavior,\u00a0Wallerstein did not believe the dolphin could have\u00a0been acting aggressively or the shooter could have been acting in self-defense.\u00a0\u00a0\u25ba Nov. 17: Dog found 'protecting the only house left on the block' after wildfire\u25ba Nov. 13: Animals affected by California wildfires\u25ba Nov. 13: Child 'heartbroken' after stuffed animal snake confiscated at airportThe dolphin likely was shot off the coast because that's where the protected species is most common.\u00a0Wallerstein theorized the shooter was far enough off shore\u00a0to be isolated:\u00a0\u201cThey knew they weren\u2019t being watched.\u201dThe National Marine Fishery Service is investigating the incident, he said.Wallerstein's organization is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction, he said Saturday.
