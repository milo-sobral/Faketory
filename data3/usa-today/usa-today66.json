The fact that the measure includes language purporting to mitigate these impacts is further evidence of the regressive nature of the proposal. It would also damage our state\u2019s economy.A study by National Economic Research Associates consulting firm found that the $30 billion in new taxes collected over 15 years would cost the equivalent of 21,300 jobs and reduce the gross state product by $5.3 billion. Gasoline prices would increase by 13 cents per gallon in the first year alone, increasing annually with no cap, adding up to 59 cents more per gallon within 15 years.All told, the firm estimates total costs per household at $440 in 2020, increasing to $990 by 2035.Finally, the initiative provides no specific spending plan, too little accountability and no requirements to reduce greenhouse gases. It gives an unelected board of political appointees a blank check to spend billions as they choose, without real legislative oversight or accountability to voters.The initiative is a costly, unfair and ineffective tax that would damage our state\u2019s economy and would block the pathway to meaningful climate policy. On Tuesday, Washingtonians should reject 1631.Bob Edwards is past president of the Association of Washington Cities, the Port of Seattle Board of Commissioners and the Puget Sound Regional Council.If you can't see this reader\u00a0poll, please refresh your page.\u00a0"}
