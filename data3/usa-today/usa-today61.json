Col. Tracy A. Bunko.The development is \u201can extremely good sign,\u201d Bunko said, adding that the academy is \u201cgrateful for the outpouring of support and optimistic for Aurora\u2019s recovery.\u201dThe falcon will continue to be evaluated and will get antibiotics to prevent infection, Bunko said.Army officials at West Point apologized Sunday for the injuries to the falcon and promised a full investigation.\u201cWe are taking this situation very seriously, and this occurrence does not reflect the Army or USMA core values of dignity and respect,\u201d the academy said in a statement.Sam Dollar, Air Force\u2019s falconry team adviser, told The New York Times on Sunday that two West Point cadets took the birds, threw sweaters over them and stuffed them into dog crates. Dollar said the cadets turned over the birds Saturday morning, with Aurora\u2019s wings bloodied \u2013 likely from thrashing inside the crate.\u201cI think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\u201d Dollar told the newspaper. \u201cWhen Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201dMore: Air Force falcon mascot seriously injured in prank before football game at ArmyMisery Index Week 10: Ed Orgeron throws players under bus, takes big risk after LSU lossAurora is the Air Force Academy\u2019s official and oldest mascot. On the school\u2019s falconry page, the bird is described as a white phase gyrfalcon, which is a \u201cfalcon species that is extremely rare in the wild and whose beauty will take your breath away.\u201d\u201cUnless you are federally licensed, you can\u2019t even touch them,\u201d Dollas said, adding the Air Force cadets who work with the birds spend two months in training and are tested before they can handle them.Three percent of all falcons are gyrfalcons, and 1 percent of those are white, according to the website. The school acquired Aurora 22 years ago as a gift from the association of graduates.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. \u00a0\u00a0"}
