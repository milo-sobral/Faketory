Four\u00a0sacks, holding Osweiler to 15-of-24 for 139 yards. What the hell are you talking about!? That\u2019s the type of statement that pisses me off in the locker room as a defensive player and we gotta have a conversation. Because you start pointing fingers at us that we aren\u2019t doing good enough \u2013 you didn\u2019t do good enough. You didn\u2019t prepare us good enough. You didn\u2019t represent us good enough. You didn\u2019t make adjustments. We had questions and you didn\u2019t give us any answers. How about that one!\u00a0Jets fans loved what Scott had to say:make Bart Scott interim coach  cant be worse https://t.co/gFeguY8gFg\u2014 scherrenough (@djays1) November 4, 2018\"Let's Take His Drawing Board!!!\" Bart Scott has the right dam idea!
