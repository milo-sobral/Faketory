It was a heady time for a 10-year-old boy. The Mercury Seven astronauts had made anything seem possible\u00a0and now here was a red-and-black costumed human arachnid staring at me from the cover of \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d #1 at my local drugstore comic book rack.\u201cThe Fantastic Four think I\u2019m trapped! But they don\u2019t suspect my real power,\u201d the Spider-Man proclaimed, surrounded by four other colorful characters that were not as polished or familiar as Batman and Superman, my usual comic book fare.I was hooked. And I wasn\u2019t alone. Marvel Comics, the publisher of Amazing Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and a new wave of strikingly different comic books, became the comics company of choice for an entire generation.Most of the credit for that goes to Stan Lee, for decades Marvel\u2019s top writer and editor, who died this morning at age 95.Stan Lee\u2019s approach was revolutionary. His super-heroes were real people with real problems who happened to be employed saving the universe. Peter Parker was an angst-filled teen-age science student when he was a bitten by a radioactive spider. After that, he could climb walls, but bullying and girl problems could not be solved with super-strength.So the Marvel Universe was born, populated with singular heroes with singular stories. The Hulk was a scientist transformed by radiation (a lot of that going on in the \u201860s.) Thor\u2019s alter-ego was a doctor who came across a magical walking stick. The Fantastic Four were empowered by cosmic rays, but had to fend off bankruptcy and civil litigation.Most notable about Lee\u2019s success was that he had already been in the comics business for almost a quarter-century. He reinvented the industry and himself at the same time.Jack Kirby (co-creator of the Hulk and Fantastic Four) and Steve Ditko (the co-creator of Spider-Man) were giants in the field, but Lee\u2019s fingerprints were everywhere, generating plots, creating new characters and playing the role of P.T. Barnum for millions of kids who followed him and his Merry Marvel Marching Society wherever he led.More: We want a savior. Movies aren't the only place to find one.Leave dead people alone: technology threatens celebrities' image after they've moved onFlashback: It's time to create an Academy Award for best blockbusterThrough Marvel Comics, the kids of the \u201860s saw:\u25ba\u00a0Characters dealing with extraordinary power and a sense of duty.\u00a0 Peter Parker was reminded that \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\u25ba\u00a0We saw a noble African character who fought for justice and defied all stereotypes as \u201cThe Black Panther.\u201d\u25ba We saw a \u201860s society with some emerging diversity. African-American Robbie Robertson emerged as a wise figure in the pages of Spider-Man. People with disabilities became heroes (Thor, Dr. Strange and Iron Man), though\u00a0in thoroughly improbable\u00a0 ways.\u25ba\u00a0We saw racial bias filtered through science-fiction, with the coming of the X-Men and mutants, and society\u2019s backlash. That theme has been developed by Marvel to even greater effect in the past decade.But most of all, we read about decent people trying to change the world for the better. Of course, that\u2019s the theme of most heroic fiction, but somehow in Stan Lee\u2019s hands, it was that much more relatable.It was gratifying to see Lee show up at comic book conventions in recent years and be treated as the creative giant he truly was. Of course, it didn\u2019t hurt that he had cameo appearances in the mega-successful Marvel films of the 21st\u00a0Century.In each issue of Marvel\u2019s monthly comics, Lee would write a hyperbole-packed letter to readers touting the month\u2019s publications and closing with a handful of alternating well-worn phrases. No hyperbole is needed to note Lee\u2019s passing. He stirred the imagination of generations. \u201cNuff said.\u201dKen Paulson is the dean of the College of Media and Entertainment at Middle Tennessee State University, president of the Newseum Institute\u2019s First Amendment Center and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.\u00a0Follow him on Twitter:\u00a0@kenpaulson1You can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
