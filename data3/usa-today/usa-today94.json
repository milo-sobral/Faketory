The game, though, won\u2019t be played in Kansas City or Los Angeles.The game was slated as the third annual Mexico game, and like last year\u2019s game at Estadio Azteca, the NFL is raising serious concerns about the venue.Estadio Azteca switched to a hybrid turf of both synthetic and natural grass this year, and it has been unable to hold up for the stadium\u2019s busy schedule of hosting concerts and soccer matches. A recent concert had the stadium\u2019s field looking like this heading into the weekend:The @EstadioAzteca field in Mexico City was left like this after a concert just nine days before the @RamsNFL and @Chiefs will play there \ud83d\ude32(\ud83d\udcf8 @Migue_luk) pic.twitter.com/tCaOfearoo\u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) November 10, 2018Hey @ProFootballDoc this is the Aztec Stadium today. What are the risk for Rams/Chiefs players to play over there in a week? pic.twitter.com/r6ILWkaG6j\u2014 Ulises Harada (@ulisesharada) November 10, 2018With forecasts in Mexico City calling for rain the next three days, the NFL has sent a team to Mexico City to assess the field conditions \u2014 according to NBC\u2019s Peter King. There is obvious concern about the safety of the field conditions, especially for a game of this magnitude.Via NBC:There\u2019s significant worry about the playing surface at Azteca Stadium, a multi-use combined grass-and-synthetic surface used for soccer and concerts mostly, made soupy by heavy rains in this year\u2019s rainy season. Recent photos of the pitch look awful. The NFL will mobilize there today and tomorrow to see if surgery will be needed on the field before the game.Last year, an earthquake in Mexico City had the NFL reviewing the stadium\u2019s condition before giving the Patriots-Raiders game the green light.Estadio Azteca, NFL\n\t\tAndrew Joseph is a writer at For The Win.
