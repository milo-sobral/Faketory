His tone so pure, clarity and confidence. You feel like you can sing along to all of his records until you try.\u201cPretty Little Fears\u201d - 6lack featuring\u00a0J. Cole\nOne of the most exciting new singer/songwriters and overall artists out right now. He is very vulnerable and truthful in his approach. It resonates.\u00a0\u201cHome\u201d - Jaime Woods\nAn exciting young new singer/songwriter. She has a very pure voice. I love her intent and tone.\u00a0\u201cSo Easy\u201d - Estelle feat. Luke James\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one of my favorite songs that I\u2019ve written to date. It kind of flew out of my spirit. I'm grateful for it.\n\u00a0\u201cThe Rhythm\u00a0Changes\u201d - Kamasi Washington\nI found this record randomly recently and it just felt so warm and beautiful. The words feel very comforting. I play it on repeat.\n\u00a0\u201cDay Dreaming\u201d - Aretha Franklin\u00a0\nI was recently reminded of how amazing this record is. Queen Aretha's vocal approach is absolutely one of a kind on this record. The rises and dips feel really easy for her to do. It's why she is the Queen!\n\u00a0\u201cDon't Stop\u201d - Jon Batiste\nJust lush and haunting. I'm a fan of Jon Batiste in general and this is very bluesy instead of plain contemporary jazz... I love his intention on this record. It lets us into his brain a little bit, it's a beautiful love song.\n\u00a0\u201cPercogesic\u201d \u2013 Gallant\nHe's a beautiful vocalist, this is the perfect daytime working and vibes song.\n\u00a0\u201cMona Lisa\u201d - Lil Wayne feat. Kendrick Lamar\nStorytelling at its finest. Welcome back Mr. Carter!\n\u00a0\u201cA Rose In Harlem\u201d - Teyana Taylor\nThis record resonates with a lot of creatives that are going through their path trying to make something great... sometimes you doubt yourself, sometimes it\u2019s the people closest to you. Either way, you have to remember that you're pretty amazing to have even gotten as far as you have and to just get on with it."}
