Todd Young is an ex-Marine and staunch conservative not known for bucking President Donald Trump or the Republican party line. Except on one very controversial issue: Yemen\u2019s horrific civil war.Or more precisely, America\u2019s support for a deadly bombing campaign in the\u00a0Arab nation\u00a0that has created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster.An Indiana Republican and freshman senator, Young has emerged as the Trump administration\u2019s biggest irritant when it comes to its Yemen policy \u2013 persistently challenging America\u2019s military role in a campaign that has killed or injured at least 17,000 civilians, including hundreds of children, according to the United Nations. \u00a0What drew Young\u2019s attention\u00a0was not just the death toll from errant military strikes. It was the famine that truly alarmed him \u2013 a man-made catastrophe that has put more than 8 million Yemenis on the brink of starvation.\u201cIt offends my sensibilities \u2013 and I know it offends the sensibilities of all Americans \u2013 that there are countries in this day and age that are using food as a weapon of war,\u201d Young told USA TODAY.\u201cAnd\u00a0itfurther offends my sensibilities \u2026 that the United States has partnered with these countries,\u201d he said.Saudi Arabia is America\u2019s main partner in Yemen. The Saudi regime, along with the United Arab Emirates, launched a military campaign in Yemen in 2015 after Houthi rebels seized one of Yemen\u2019s largest cities and moved to replace then-President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Houthis are backed by Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s arch enemy in the region.The U.S. has supplied intelligence and weaponry to the Saudi-led coalition \u2013 siding with a key Middle East ally in a proxy war that could determine Iran's influence in the region. Trump administration officials resisted calls to reevaluate its role in August, after an errant coalition bomb hit a school bus and killed dozens of children in an incident that sparked outrage among\u00a0human-rights groups.\u00a0Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Sen.

If there\u2019s any good out of Khashoggi\u2019s death, Young said, it\u2019s put a spotlight on \u201cthe impulsiveness of many decisions that have been made by the current Saudi leadership.\u201dWhether it will be enough to spark a change in U.S. policy in Yemen remains to be seen. A congressional showdown may come after next week\u2019s midterm elections, when some lawmakers plan to try to cut off all funding for the U.S.\u2019s military role in Yemen.Young would not rule out such a dramatic step, and he could be a pivotal vote in the closely divided Senate. \u201cI\u2019m considering all options,\u201d he told USA TODAY.\n    Yemenis in an isolated pocket in the north have been reduced to eating boiled leaves from a local vine to stave off starvation, with no aid reaching many families who need it most. (Sept. 14)\n    APYoung is no bleeding-heart peacenik, nor is he a libertarian-leaning isolationist. He\u2019s a methodical, clean-cut defense hawk who trained as a\u00a0rifle platoon commander\u00a0in the Navy after graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy. He sought a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee after winning his Senate race in 2016; he previously served in the House on the armed services and tax-writing panels.Ask him why he\u2019s so interested in Yemen, and you\u2019ll get more power-point presentation than passionate soliloquy.\u201cThis is a national security issue,\u201d Young notes, explaining that the militant Islamic group known as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is headquartered in Yemen. \u201cAnd starving people \u2013 denying them basic humanitarian assistance \u2013 leads to radicalization. We don\u2019t want to create more terrorists.\u201dSenate Democrats and humanitarian aid groups say Young has proven to be a surprising and effective ally in their efforts to mitigate the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Yemen.\u201cHe\u2019s in a unique position to convince this administration to do things that I can\u2019t,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, a liberal Democrat from Connecticut who has crusaded against U.S. support for the Saudi-led war. \u201cHe has very wisely used his leverage as an influential member of the (Republican) conference to get the administration and the Gulf States to change their disposition.\u201dMore: US lawmakers demand answers after scores of children killed in Yemen airstrikeMore: Yemen facing 'largest famine in decades' if blockade isn't lifted, U.N. aid chief saysMore: Can the U.S.-Saudi relationship survive journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s presumed killing?Take, for example, the Saudi government\u2019s refusal last summer to allow four U.S.- funded cranes to be delivered to a key Yemeni port, where they were supposed to be used to help offload desperately needed food and medicine.Young fumed over the Saudi blockade, publicly and privately lobbying the Saudis and the Trump administration over the issue. In July\u00a02017, he convened a\u00a0Senate hearing to help spotlight the Saudis\u2019 role, first in bombing the existing cranes, along with a warehouse full of food, and then in blocking ships that carried four new cranes, which he noted had cost American taxpayers $3.8 million.\u201cI will want to ensure that the Saudis get all the public credit \u2013 or shame \u2013 they deserve\u201d for impeding the cranes, he said at the July\u00a0hearing.Five months later, amid growing international outrage, the Saudis relented and agreed to let the cranes through. It was hardly a panacea, but it saved tens of thousands of lives, Young said.If Democrats and human rights group are cheering Young\u2019s attention to Yemen, the Trump administration is probably not.Young blocked the confirmation of a key State Department nominee until he got answers from the administration about the Saudis\u2019 compliance with international law. He hand-delivered a missive to Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, demanding a \u201ccomprehensive diplomatic effort\u201d to address the humanitarian crisis Yemen and several other countries. When that didn\u2019t produce the desired results, he teamed up with a key Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, to pass legislation requiring the State Department to certify Saudi Arabia and the UAE were working to reduce civilian casualties and not impeding the delivery of food and medicine.A State Department spokesperson did not respond to questions about Young\u2019s role, offering instead a general statement reiterating the administration\u2019s efforts to bring about a political settlement to end to the war.\u00a0\u201cThey won\u2019t say it on the record, but you talk to folks in the administration, and they say the single biggest force moving the conflict in a positive direction has been congressional pressure,\u201d said Scott Paul, a top advocate for Oxfam America. \u201cAnd Sen. Young has been at the heart of that.\u201dPaul said Young has been effective in part because he\u2019s not splashy in his confrontations.\u201cIt\u2019s private, it's quiet, it requires diligence and sustained attention,\u201d he said of Young's legislative work on the issue.At the same time, Paul and others lament that Young and other lawmakers have not been able to force a real reckoning over the war in Yemen. That could change with the Khashoggi killing, which has encouraged Murphy and other Democrats to ratchet up their pressure.Murphy has vowed to try to block any U.S. arms sales to the Saudis, and lawmakers in the House are planning to force a vote that would end American military involvement in the Yemen conflict.For now, Young is focused on getting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to answer key questions about how responsible the Saudis are for a recent spike in civilian casualties. He and Shaheen could use such data to block the administration from refueling Saudi jets as they carry out the bombing campaign.Young declined\u00a0to say if he's butted heads with Pompeo or other White House officials\u00a0and insists he's giving the president \"leverage,\" not pushing the administration to be more accountable. But, he added, he will use whatever tools he has to\u00a0force a more humanitarian policy.\u201cI feel emboldened to provide this administration additional leverage \u2026 and help bring the worst humanitarian crisis since the \u201840s to an end,\u201d Young\u00a0said.More: Turkey says Jamal Khashoggi 'ferociously murdered' by Saudi Arabian hit squadMore: Trump on Saudi handling of Khashoggi death: \u2018Worst cover-up ever\u2019More: Who was Jamal Khashoggi?
