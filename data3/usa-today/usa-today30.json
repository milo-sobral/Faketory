Though there aren\u2019t interior photos of the house, Luxury Estates broker and founder Kamran Zand has provided an exterior look at the home.Credit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCredit: Kamran Zand/Luxury Estates InternationalCool houses, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Boxing\n\t\tAndrew Joseph is a writer at For The Win.
