The move allowed the Rams to run out the clock and beat the Packers 29-27.Fantasy owners who had Gurley in their lineups would have loved another TD from Gurley. And Matthew Berry, ESPN\u2019s fantasy guy, has a message for those people: @matthewberrytmr feels some type of way about Fantasy managers with Todd Gurley on their roster.A post shared by  SportsNation (@sportsnation) on Oct 29, 2018 at 6:46pm PDTThat\u2019s a pretty rant right there.
