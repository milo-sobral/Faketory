A few weeks later, the same became true for Kyle Busch.A quarter of the way into a 36-race season, Harvick and Busch had each recorded three-race win streaks. Fast forward to the Cup Series finale \u2014 Sunday\u2019s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway \u2014 and they\u2019re tied for the most wins in the series this season with eight apiece, matching a career-high for Busch and setting a personal best for Harvick.So it\u2019s far from surprising that the No. 4 Ford and No. 18 Toyota are two of the final four teams racing for a championship. It\u2019d actually be a disappointment if they weren\u2019t, and if neither of them win their second Cup Series title Sunday, that, too, would be a disappointingly anticlimactic end to two exceptionally dominant seasons.That\u2019s not a knock against defending Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Joey Logano, the other two drivers competing for the title. They\u2019re both skilled racers who deserve to be among the Championship 4, with Truex having four checkered flags and Logano with two as he and his team found their rhythm through the first nine playoff races. Their teams are certainly worthy of winning a title.As we so often see in sports, sometimes, the best team doesn\u2019t win the championship. But with the Big Three \u2014 the season-long nickname dealt to Harvick, Busch and Truex \u2014 among the championship contenders, the best NASCAR teams are actually fighting for the trophy, which is great for the struggling sport.(Chris Graythen/Getty Images)\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a successful year, but I don\u2019t think it would be truly successful without being able to bring home that championship,\u201d Busch said Thursday.\u201cIt depends on who you lose it to. Obviously, Harvick\u2019s done a phenomenal job. Those guys and that group have been so good all season long, even in the late stages of last year. You lose it to him, and it\u2019s like, yeah OK, I can see why they got it.\u201dAlthough Truex is among the dominant three, Harvick and Busch \u2014 who were the Cup Series champions in 2014 and 2015, respectively \u2014 are in their own zip code and have been for the majority of the season. Along with their eight wins each, Harvick and Busch have led almost 34 percent of the 9,983 laps this year combined \u2014 and the No. 4 team is at nearly 20 percent on its own.Even when they don\u2019t win a race, they\u2019re often still in it by the end. Harvick has 22 top-5 finishes, and Busch has 21. And when they\u2019ve occasionally started races toward the back of the field, they\u2019ve flexed their speed and caught up to the front. Friday, Busch qualified second, while Harvick will start from the 12th spot.Their teams haven\u2019t had to be perfect to win \u2014 though they might have to be Sunday as they race each other, first and foremost \u2014 but, as Logano previously told For The Win, everyone else has to be perfect to beat them.(Matt Sullivan/Getty Images)\u201cI know how hard this is, and I know that there are so many things that can go wrong,\u201d Harvick said while explaining why he won\u2019t call it a disappointing season if he doesn\u2019t win.\u201cSometimes you\u2019re going to win, sometimes you\u2019re going to lose. I think we\u2019re in a better position to win this year than we were last year. I know that for sure because of the speed of the cars. I look at this year from a speed of the car standpoint, and it\u2019s just as good as the year we won the championship.\u201dHis fans \u2014 and, separately, Busch\u2019s \u2014 might feel differently if their driver isn\u2019t hoisting a trophy.Harvick\u2019s and Busch\u2019s cars have earned the right to be called the fastest of the 2018 season \u2014 no matter what happens at Homestead \u2014 and if one of them wins Sunday, it will be easy to declare him the best of the best this season. If Truex or Logano win, we\u2019ll talk about their impressive performance or clever strategy in this particular event and the playoffs overall. We\u2019ll repeatedly break down how they beat the other three championship contenders.But the prowess of Harvick and Busch will still remain the major takeaway this season.Everyone loves crazy upsets and wild finishes, and that would certainly make for an entertaining end to the season. Logano could win his first championship, while Truex could be the first driver to defend his title in eight years and do it in his team\u2019s final race before closing up shop.But it just seems like Harvick and Busch have already earned the right to be NASCAR\u2019s champion. Their last 10 months have been aggressively building up to this moment. Now, one of them just has to take it.Joey Logano, Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, Martin Truex Jr, NASCAR, NASCAR playoffs, NASCAR, Racing\n\t\tMichelle is a writer at FTW, covering NASCAR and other sports.
