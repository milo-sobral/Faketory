The other was decomposing and tangled in the other head's antlers.\u00a0\"It's unclear exactly what circumstances led up to this buck's carrying around another set of antlers and part of a decomposing carcass.

Tony Dunker with Kentucky Fish and Wildlife told that\u00a0he suspects the decaying head belonged to a deer who had been dead for weeks after locking antlers in a fight. Ballard County, where the deer was shot, is in far western Kentucky where Illinois and Missouri meet, about 30 miles southeast of Cape Girardeau.Dunker thinks that the bucks fought over territory or mates. After one died, its body decayed to the point where the head came loose, according to\u00a0Dunker's account.\"He packed it around a little while until Mr. Long came along,\" Dunker said of the deer and the extra head. Residents in the area previously had spotted the buck alive with the decaying head in its antlers and taken pictures.Contributing: WHAS-TV, Louisville, Ky.
