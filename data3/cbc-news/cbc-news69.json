{"id": "Quebec City offers lesson in overcoming hate for victims of Pittsburgh shooting", "paragraph": "Quebec City, still healing from a deadly\u00a0attack on one of its\u00a0religious minorities is showing the way forward to a another city where the pain from a similar attack is still fresh.Members from Quebec City's Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities\u00a0joined together Sunday at city hall for a ceremony honouring the victims of\u00a0last month's\u00a0shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.Eleven people were killed and six others injured. It is considered the deadliest anti-Semitic\u00a0attack in U.S. history.\u00a0\"Even if 1,200 kilometres separates us, we share their pain because we recognize it,\" said Quebec City Mayor\u00a0R\u00e9gis Labeaume.On\u00a0Jan. 29, 2017, six members of the city's Muslim community were killed in a shooting at a suburban mosque,\u00a0considered the deadliest Islamophobic attack in Canadian history.Residents responded to the tragedy by forging closer ties with minority groups in the city,\u00a0Labeaume\u00a0said.\u00a0\"Today our city is more united in its diversity,\" the mayor added. \"It's now our turn to bring hope of a better future to our friends in Pittsburgh.\"Magda Belkacemi, whose father was killed in the Quebec City mosque shooting, said\u00a0that the expressions of solidarity that poured in afterward helped her own grieving process.\"We have to fight hate, we have to fight intolerance, no matter what form it takes,\" she said. \"There should be no more victims to this hate.\"Following the shooting in\u00a0Pittsburgh, the head of the mosque that was attacked last year\u00a0\u2014 the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City\u00a0\u2014 immediately phoned the rabbi of a local\u00a0synagogue.The deeper ties that have developed between the different faiths in Quebec City should offer a sign of hope for Jews in\u00a0Pittsburgh who may be feeling vulnerable, said\u00a0David Weiser, president of Quebec City's\u00a0Beth Isra\u00ebl Ohev Sholom synagogue.\"Despite the dark cloud that seems to want to cast itself over world politics at the current time, there are rays of light that illuminate Quebec City,\"\u00a0Weiser\u00a0said at Sunday's\u00a0ceremony.He noted that Quebec City's Jewish community hasn't been spared its own encounters with anti-Semitism.There was an arson at a synagogue in 1944,\u00a0a Jewish cemetery was vandalized in 1990 and in 2002, a bomb was tossed at a synagogue.But in 2018,\u00a0Weiser\u00a0said, the city's diverse residents are\u00a0standing in solidarity with its Jewish community in an effort to combat hate. \"It's incredible,\" he said.With files from Radio-CanadaAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
