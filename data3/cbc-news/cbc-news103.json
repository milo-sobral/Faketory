{"id": "PQ holds campaign 'post-mortem', tries to chart course back from the brink", "paragraph": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e says the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois' recent election debacle wasn't his fault.\"I think one of the paradoxes of this campaign is that we ran a good campaign, but we didn't win,\" Lis\u00e9e said.The former leader instead blames October's result \u2014 which saw his party go from 28 to 10 seats in the National Assembly and lose official party status \u2014 on Quebecers' desire to get rid of the Liberals at all costs.Lis\u00e9e says voters saw Fran\u00e7ois Legault's CAQ as the best \"tool\" to accomplish that goal, despite his efforts to woo them to the PQ side.\"It says a lot about the strength and the willingness of the electorate to try a new party to govern,\" said Lis\u00e9e.But that feeling was not unanimous among PQ members who gathered on Saturday afternoon at Coll\u00e8ge de Maisonneuve in Montreal for a campaign post-mortem.About 300 people \u2014 MNAs, losing candidates and riding association presidents \u2014 participated in the closed-door meeting, which is mandatory in the 60 days following an election, according to the party's statutes.Interim leader Pascal B\u00e9rub\u00e9, the MNA for Matane-Matap\u00e9dia called the party's campaign \"not that good.\" He said the first thing the PQ needs to do is do an inventory of what worked, and what didn't.One thing that didn't work, according to the party's youth wing president, was Lis\u00e9e's surprise attack on Manon Mass\u00e9, the co-spokesperson of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c\u00a0Solidaire.\"I think it surely didn't help, especially on campus and with\u00a0the youth,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique St-Jean. \"Many of the youth like Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Solidaire.\"During the second French-language debate,\u00a0Lis\u00e9e\u00a0went off topic during a question about health care and instead confronted Mass\u00e9\u200b.He suggested Mass\u00e9 was not the real leader of QS and that someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes.\"It's doing politics negatively and that's what we tried to go away from,\" said St-Jean.Party members also pointed to the decision to put sovereignty on the back burner as a mistake.During the campaign Lis\u00e9e pledged a PQ government would not hold a referendum on Quebec independence in a first mandate.Some delegates said that move deflated sovereignist spirits and fractured the coalition of pro-independence voters who have traditionally backed the PQ.\"By pushing back the date of independence people didn't see us as a real pro-independence party,\" said Nicolas Marceau, former PQ finance minister under Pauline Marois, who lost his seat in Rousseau to Louis-Charles Thouin of the CAQ.\"The identity of the Parti Quebecois was no longer clear to voters,\" Marceau said.Saturday's debrief session started with words from party president Gabrielle Lemieux and a speech by B\u00e9rub\u00e9 who invited the party's 10 remaining MNAs to join him on stage.The small contingent was a far cry from the party's glory days, when leaders like Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque and Jacques Parizeau led the PQ to majority governments.There was also a moment of silence for former leader and premier Bernard Landry who died on November 6 at the age of 81.With Lis\u00e9e out, the PQ will need to find a new boss. B\u00e9rub\u00e9 says he won't run for the leadership.Lis\u00e9e's deputy leader during the campaign, V\u00e9ronique Hivon, is seen as a potential successor.Hivon \u2014 who held onto her seat in Joliette\u00a0this election \u2014 showed an ability to fire up the sovereignist base during speeches on the campaign trail.The 48 year-old is also seen as being more open to working with Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Solidaire.On Saturday, Hivon wouldn't comment on her leadership aspirations: \"What I want right now is for us to give us time,\" Hivon said.\"The last thing we need to rush is into leadership questions and a leadership campaign.\"Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
