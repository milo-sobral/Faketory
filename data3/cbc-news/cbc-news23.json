Initially, the bridge was supposed to be open for drivers by December 1, 2018.Federal Infrastructure\u00a0Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne is to\u00a0announce the delay Thursday. All union members have been invited by management to a meeting\u00a0one hour before the announcement takes place.Earlier this month, Infrastructure Canada said the bridge would open in time for its December deadline, but a spokesperson\u00a0opened the door to possible delays.\"As you know, the construction of the new bridge is big and complex,\" explained Caroline Marchildon, director of advisory and corporate services, at that\u00a0time.Last week, Champagne was asked about whether there would be a delay. He did not confirm a delay at the time, but told\u00a0reporters that his priority is the health and safety of workers.According to Radio-Canada's sources, security issues and the onset of winter could be among the reasons\u00a0put forward to justify the delay.The project is valued at $4.2 billion.Mayor Val\u00e9rie\u00a0Plante\u00a0said she was informed of the delay on Wednesday. She acknowledged that winter conditions have an impact on construction sites.She said she was \"somewhat disappointed\" by the delay. She said she will remain in contact with the minister to work to mitigate any additional traffic concerns continued construction could cause.\u00a0According to the contract signed in 2015, heavy penalties are to\u00a0be imposed on the construction consortium if it delivers the work later than Dec.\u00a021, 2018.\u00a0With files from Radio-Canada's Thomas GerbetAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
