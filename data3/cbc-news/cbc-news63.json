If they were trained in the right way, they'd know ... how to handle a situation like that,\" Erma Gibbs, Nicholas' mother told the crowd.They gathered at the place he was killed, on de Maisonneuve Blvd and Montclair Ave.The video released this week showed police fired five shots, including while Gibbs had his back turned.Officers in the video yelled at Gibbs to drop a knife, but his family disputes that Gibbs had a weapon, saying that no weapon is visible in the video.A march is underway in NDG calling for justice for Nicholas Gibbs, the 23-year-old man shot and killed by police in August. <a href=\"https://t.co/XrXvBLrVq6\">pic.twitter.com/XrXvBLrVq6</a>His family says that Gibbs was in mental distress in the lead up to the confrontation with police.

If I go and I kill someone right now, I'm going to jail. They'll bury me, right? But if they go kill someone, they can go kick their feet up and chill on their sofa? I think that's crap. And I feel like with a system like that, no one will ever trust the police and no one will ever trust the system,\" said Jeremy Gibbs.He added that when his uncle was first killed, he wasn't sure that anyone cared, but that the vigil tonight showed him that was not the case.Jeremy Gibbs (in front wearing a hat) wants police to be charged in his uncle\u2019s death.
