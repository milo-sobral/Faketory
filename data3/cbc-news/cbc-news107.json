The origin of the trees and why Shimizu decided to donate them is unclear, according to his\u00a0family.In March of this year, several of the trees were chopped down, while others were aggressively pruned by contractors doing landscaping work outside the Department of Fisheries and Oceans building in downtown Prince Rupert .The destruction of the trees caused an uproar in the town among\u00a0people who enjoyed the look of the trees as they bloomed in spring and summer.Greg Shimizu, Shotaro's grandson and the son of Harry, is making the most of the unfortunate incident. He said it has allowed him the opportunity to learn more about his grandfather's legacy.\"For us, as a family, coming out here is delving into our mythical family history,\" Shimizu\u00a0said.\u00a0He is also collecting wood from the downed trees and plans to transform\u00a0them into bachi \u2014\u00a0drumsticks used to play taiko, Japanese percussion.Shimizu performs in a group called the Blooming Tree Taiko, a Japanese percussion group whose name is inspired by his grandfather's donation.The federal government says three remaining cherry blossom trees\u00a0may still\u00a0regain health and bloom once more.Listen to the full interview below:With files from Andrew Kurjata\u00a0and Daybreak NorthAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
