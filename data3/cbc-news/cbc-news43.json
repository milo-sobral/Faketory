It has $24 million dollars in government funding to recruit and train Indigenous people from Labrador to work at the mine.\u00a0\"You have to be a member of those three Aboriginal groups to avail of this training,\" Jacque said.\u00a0LATP\u00a0provides\u00a0a number of opportunities for people thinking about getting into the industry, from underground mine visits, to a virtual mine simulator\u00a0to a full four-week\u00a0\"common core\" program in Sudbury, Ont., which will earn participants certification to work in an underground mine.\u00a0\"All expenses are covered for personal protective equipment or childcare while they are away, and even while they're up there we put them up in a hotel and we'll help them with with meals,\" Jacque said.\"We try to eliminate all those barriers as much as we can.\"Pien Peters used to work at\u00a0Voisey's\u00a0Bay as a cook, he said, but now he wants to take a turn in the mine itself.\u00a0\"I would like [to be] a heavy equipment operator or a labourer,\" Peters said.\"I'd like to explore a new job\u00a0\u2026\u00a0a new road.\"Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
