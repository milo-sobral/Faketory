{"id": "Bullets narrowly miss Toronto boy, 8, as he goes to buy candy", "paragraph": "An eight-year-old boy who was caught in a hail of gunfire in Toronto's Jamestown neighbourhood Saturday night has told\u00a0CBC\u00a0Toronto that he was out to buy his friend some candy when shots rang out.CBC\u00a0Toronto is withholding the boy's\u00a0name because he is an underage victim of crime.Police released security camera footage of the incident Wednesday. It\u00a0shows\u00a0the boy crossing the street after another male. A\u00a0white\u00a0SUV\u00a0then pulls up, with one of two shooters firing in the direction of the boy.\u00a0The boy runs and hides in an alcove. One person could be seen on the video\u00a0coming back to pick up a magazine from the gun.Police\u00a0aren't able to confirm if the other male was\u00a0the intended target. They also\u00a0say\u00a0there is a possibility that the shooting was a random gang\u00a0shooting\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 where a gang member would enter an area and shoot at someone randomly.\u00a0\"This is absolutely disgusting that we're here watching an eight-year-old possibly being a target and being shot,\" police Supt. Ron Taverner told the media Wednesday.\u00a0\"It's very outrageous that this has taken place in our community\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that people have a total disregard for human life, for children playing in an area.\"Police said earlier that the incident happened\u00a0in the area of Jamestown Crescent and John Garland Boulevard on Saturday shortly after 9:30 p.m. and that\u00a0a group of young people was present.\u00a0Taverner said Wednesday that five to seven children were playing a game called Hide from the Black Car there.\"What that game was, was hiding from black SUVs that might come down the street because traditionally that's the type of vehicle that the shooters have been in that have shot up in that area previously,\" he said. \"It's pretty disgusting\u00a0to think that young kids that age are playing a game like that.\"No injuries were reported in the shooting.The boy's mother says she hears gunshots in the area all the time.\u00a0\"I definitely want to get out of here. I didn't want to come here in the first place. I had no choice. I had to move here. Six years now, and it\u00a0hasn't stopped. It's just getting worse,\" she said.\u00a0She says she has three kids, and her son is the youngest. She no longer feels safe.\u00a0\"They see my son right there, and they're still firing shots. They don't care if it\u00a0had hit him. They don't care.\"Police say they are looking for two\u00a0shooters who arrived in the white SUV, and the vehicle's driver.\u00a0The area has been\u00a0canvassed, police say.\u00a0Police believe\u00a0at least two weapons were used. None has\u00a0been recovered, but 15 shell casings were recovered from different calibre guns.Taverner said police have been in contact with the boy and his family and have been offered victim services.\u00a0\"He's doing fairly well. Obviously, he and his family are very upset, concerned,\"\u00a0he said. \"We're continuing to reach out to them and make sure that they're continuing to do OK. But you can imagine how traumatic an experience this is.\"\u00a0Police say one suspect is\u00a0described as a black male with a medium build wearing a dark-coloured jacket, a hoodie and dark pants.They describe\u00a0the suspect vehicle as possibly being a white 2010 or 2011 Toyota Rav4 with a sunroof.Police are asking for the vehicle's driver and witnesses to come forward by contacting police or Crime Stoppers.\"It's a miracle that this young boy\u00a0wasn't struck,\" Taverner\u00a0said. \"We want to find out who these individuals are.\"With files from Ali ChiassonAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
