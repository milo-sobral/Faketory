The incidents are alleged to have taken place between 1975 and 1979.\u00a0Chernick, 82, has pleaded not guilty.\u00a0The trial was originally set to start in November 2017, but was rescheduled due to a medical issue. Chernick had been admitted to hospital a week before the trial was originally supposed to start.\u00a0On Wednesday, Chernick's sister Robin Tyler was called to testify.\u00a0Crown attorney Debbie Buors questioned Tyler about her relationship with her brother and how she first heard of the allegations against him.Tyler said in the early 1980s, Chernick's\u00a0daughter Sharon and another family member\u00a0came to visit her in San Francisco and told her about the allegations of molestation.\u00a0\"It was shocking,\" said Tyler, adding she couldn't imagine it happening in her family.Tyler, 76, also testified that after hearing of the allegations she called her other brother\u00a0and later travelled to Winnipeg for a meeting with the accused and some other\u00a0family members.\u00a0Tyler\u00a0could not recall the length of the meeting but said it happened at a Winnipeg hotel and that she told the accused to apologize for what he had done. Tyler told the court she heard him apologize in the meeting.\u00a0She said she didn't go to police at that time because the family didn't want her to, however she said she did meet with family therapists.\u00a0Defence lawyer Sarah\u00a0Inness\u00a0questioned\u00a0Tyler's\u00a0recollection\u00a0about both the meeting and the call Tyler\u00a0testified that she made to one of her brothers.Richard\u00a0Chernick\u00a0and his sister Sharon\u00a0Chernick\u00a0filed a civil lawsuit in 2014 against their father, alleging he \"sexually, physically, emotionally and mentally abused, assaulted and traumatized\" them, and committed incest and gross indecency against them for years.In the civil action, Dr.\u00a0Chernick\u00a0denied the allegations and said they are made out of spite and ill will, and result from \"fertile imaginations.\"\u00a0This trial is expected to wrap up next Friday.\u00a0With files from Dean Pritchard, Vera-lynn\u00a0Kubinec\u00a0and Katie NicholsonAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
