{"id": "SFU students grill administrators over proposed tuition increases, executive salaries", "paragraph": "About 30 Simon Fraser University students expressed outrage and anger\u00a0over proposed tuition hikes during a consultation with school administrators on Burnaby Mountain.\u00a0\u00a0\"You need to look us in the face and see how we live, how we work full time and\u00a0go to school full time,\" said one of the students.\u00a0\"It's not enough for you to say that your hands are tied.\"According to numbers presented by Martin\u00a0Pochurko, vice president of finance and administration, first year international students entering the business or engineering faculty next year\u00a0will be paying 20 per cent and 16 per cent more respectively.All other international undergraduate students are being hit with a four per cent across the board hike, while domestic student\u00a0tuition will go up the maximum allowable two per cent.\"What I'm concerned about is that every year tuition goes up,\" said fourth year political science student Andrea. \"And what I'm really concerned about is that for international students, this\u00a0is unsustainable.\"Pochurko\u00a0said the increases are necessary to avoid a deficit of $15 million. He said even with raises, the university will still have a\u00a0shortfall of $3.1 million in the 2019-2020 budget year.\u00a0\"We do have a gap and we do need to solve it,\" he said.\u00a0A number of students highlighted alternate\u00a0ways\u00a0the school could make up the shortfall, including curtailing salary and benefits to administrators.\u00a0One student received applause when he noted that a number of SFU administrators\u00a0earned more than\u00a0Justin Trudeau.\u00a0\"The president is making more than the prime minister of Canada, c'mon,\" yelled third-year computer science student Giovanni HoSang.According to the SFU\u00a0Tuition Freeze Now student group, SFU president Andrew Petter is set to earn approximately $523,000 in salary and expenses this year while another seven administrators and deans, including Pochurko\u00a0and Keller will earn well over $300,000.The prime minister makes $347,000 a year.There was more cheering when another student\u00a0suggested school administrators take pay cuts equal to any tuition increases they bring in.Vice President of Academic and Provost Peter\u00a0Keller replied by saying SFU\u00a0has among\u00a0the lowest administration costs of any university in Canada.He also said\u00a0international undergraduate students bear the brunt of the increases because their tuition increases aren't capped by the province.\"Domestic fees are frozen at two\u00a0percent and that really leaves international\u00a0students as the only variable we can look at,\" he said.That comment was little comfort to Jade Ho, a foreign PhD student in education who works three jobs to make ends meet.\u00a0Ho says SFU administrators are being disingenuous when they describe today's meeting as a \"consultation.\"\u00a0\"They do this every year and every single year students say we can't afford an increase but tuition keeps going up. They use a lot of abstract words like 'steps are being taken'\u00a0or 'considerations are being made,' but when we ask what 'steps' or what 'considerations' we don't hear anything concrete,\" she said.\"What we really hope is the school hears us today and starts taking steps toward a tuition freeze.\"Ho also questioned why SFU\u00a0scheduled the consultation during the busy midterm season, something that she believes prevented many more students from attending.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
