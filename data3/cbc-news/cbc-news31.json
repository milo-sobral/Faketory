{"id": "New company promises to take over some of Greyhound's routes in Western Canada", "paragraph": "Ahead of Greyhound's last Western Canada runs, there's a new bus company promising to swoop in and take over some of the old routes.Rider Express is ready with six buses able to carry 55 passengers, two running between Calgary and Vancouver, and one running between Calgary and Winnipeg \u2014 seven days a week.The company plans to start service from Vancouver to Winnipeg on Oct.\u00a029, just before Greyhound stops service in Western Canada.But days before the routes start up, the company is still putting the final touches on where it will pick up and drop off passengers, and have yet to update information online about their service and its exact pricing.\u00a0\"We are working hard to get this service up and running,\" said owner Firat\u00a0Uray. \"If everything goes smoothly, we're ready to go.\"\u00a0The pricing will look similar to what Greyhound charged, but Uray\u00a0said the company is\u00a0watching the model to see if it is sustainable. If it needs to adjust, you might see fares go up.\u00a0For the rides to be profitable, he said, the buses need 15 to 20 passengers.\u00a0\"We are getting closer to those long weekends and Christmas,\" Uray said. \"We're hoping we will be OK.\"\u00a0\u00a0In July, Greyhound Canada announced\u00a0the cancellations of its passenger bus and freight services in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. At the time, Greyhound's senior vice-president Stuart Kendrick\u00a0said these routes weren't sustainable.\u00a0The company halted all but one route in B.C. \u2014 a U.S.-run service between Vancouver and Seattle.\u00a0The new company won't be running its fleet out of big terminals, like the one still standing in Calgary. Uray said those are too expensive for now.\u00a0He said the buses will stop at busy Husky gas stations. The company is finalizing an agreement with the Husky at Barlow Trail and 32nd Avenue N.E.Uray said Rider Express has hired some ex-Greyhound drivers and other bus operators with years of experiences.To begin with, the buses will have water onboard, Wi-Fi capabilities and video entertainment.The trip between Calgary and Vancouver is pegged at 12 hours, because the bus will stop only at pre-arranged points.\u00a0Rider Transportation hails from Regina, and was serving the area with full-size vans seating 15 people. It's been operating that service for 1\u00bd years.\u00a0With files from Colin Hall.Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
