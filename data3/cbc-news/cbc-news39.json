As we have stated consistently, our approach will recognize Alberta's Climate Leadership Plan and the means by which emissions are managed,\" said Theriault.Phillips did not meet with her federal counterpart Catherine McKenna today, saying she is well aware of Alberta's concerns.\"This is too important to get wrong and we will work with who ever wants to work with us to make it right.\"Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
