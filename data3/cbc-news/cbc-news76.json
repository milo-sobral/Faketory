{"id": "New Westminster WWI veteran gets grave marker after 79 years", "paragraph": "For 79 years, William A. Stevenson, a veteran of the First World War, has been buried in New Westminster B.C.'s Fraser Cemetery\u00a0with nothing to mark\u00a0his grave site.Now, after a local funding campaign raised thousands of dollars this past year, Stevenson finally has a grave marker with his name on it.\"It's important to give him his legacy to let people know his story,\" said\u00a0Robert Rathbun, president the Society of the Honourable Guard, which promotes awareness of veterans.Rathbun said Stevenson fought for the Canadian Mounted Rifles in the First World War\u00a0and returned to New Westminster after the conflict ended. He lived at 315 Columbia Street and died in 1939 at the age of 55.He was originally from Ireland and had no family in Canada to pay for his funeral. The cost was borne by the Canadian Pension Board, but there was no\u00a0money for a marker on his grave.The Society of the Honourable Guard runs a program that has school children and youth tend the grave sites by cleaning and maintaining them.\"They've always questioned, 'Why are there no stones on some of these graves?'\" he said.The\u00a0grave marker for Stevenson was dedicated in a ceremony on Saturday.\u00a0Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
