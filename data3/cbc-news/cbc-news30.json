{"id": "Sick children from Quebec's remote regions now accompanied by parents 'in 98% of cases'", "paragraph": "The government agency that manages Quebec's air-ambulance service said parents have been able to accompany their children on emergency flights\u00a0in \"98 per cent\" of cases over the past month.\u00c9vacuations a\u00e9rom\u00e9dicales du Qu\u00e9bec (EVAQ) said it has now fully implemented its new policy, allowing caregivers to\u00a0accompany minors on medical evacuation flights.The policy was adopted last June, after\u00a0a group of doctors launched a campaign to\u00a0call\u00a0attention\u00a0to the fact that EVAQ's refusal to allow parents to accompany their sick children during\u00a0medical emergencies threatened the\u00a0well-being of those\u00a0children,\u00a0especially\u00a0Indigenous children who often do not speak English or French.Doctors\u00a0gave examples, such as\u00a0needing a child's medical history or other information to reach a diagnosis, or needing a parent's consent to perform a procedure, and the parents being unreachable \u2014 trying to make their way from their remote home to their child's side.Much has been done in the past several months\u00a0to address these concerns, said\u00a0EVAQ's co-ordinator, Sylvie C\u00f4t\u00e9.In July, Julie\u00a0Ikey, a woman\u00a0from Salluit\u00a0in\u00a0Nunavik, became the first mother to accompany her child on a medevac to Montreal when her 12-year-old son crashed his bike, rupturing his spleen.In the months since then, doctors said, 50 to 60 per cent of sick children\u00a0medevaced\u00a0south have been\u00a0accompanied by a caregiver.However, C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the only request\u00a0that has been refused since Sept. 14 was a father from the Gasp\u00e9 region who could not board the plane with his newborn\u00a0because the four passenger seats aboard the Challenger aircraft were already taken up\u00a0by medical staff.\"We then try to transport the parent with our shuttle planes\u00a0to bring them as quickly as possible to the health centre,\"\u00a0C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0testified on Wednesday\u00a0at the Viens\u00a0inquiry into the province's treatment of Indigenous people.(EVAQ\u00a0has a fleet of four airplanes to transport patients from Quebec's isolated communities for emergency procedures: two Challenger\u00a0aircrafts\u00a0\u2014 which cover longer distances\u00a0\u2014 and two Dash-8 planes, normally used as a shuttle service in non-critical situations.)Last week, the Viens commission heard from Cree parents from Waswanipi, Que., who weren't able to accompany their 6-year-old to Montreal in August, after doctors suspected he was bleeding internally.Valerie-Lynn Gull\u00a0said her son Pelle Jr. was terrified to take off alone, and asked her repeatedly why she could not go with him. She said\u00a0she was never told why she couldn't accompany him.C\u00f4t\u00e9 said if the situation were to happen again today, Gull could likely have been able to go\u00a0with her son, because EVAQ no longer requires a flight attendant be on board to accompany the caregiver.\u00a0In Gull's case, the air ambulance would have had to make a stop in Quebec City to pick up a flight attendant\u00a0before heading to the Chibougamau\u00a0hospital where Pelle Jr. was being treated, C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained.\"The doctor said 'No, I prefer that he be sent right away, because he's not doing well',\" she said.It took several months to implement the changes\u00a0in EVAQ's new policy,\u00a0C\u00f4t\u00e9 said.\"This summer we had a flight attendant or a nurse on board to show that the medical staff could support the parent,\" she said.The policy changes\u00a0also required the collaboration of pilots and the ministry of transport, said Andr\u00e9 Lizotte, the director of pre-hospital emergency services with the Ministry of Health and Social Services.EVAQ\u00a0has always had to comply with aviation rules, he said.\"There has always been resistance over safety concerns,\" said Lizotte.Any modifications to the layout of the airplane,\u00a0to\u00a0make more room for a parent, also had to comply with the aircraft's certifications, he said.It was only a federal regulation change in 2017 that allowed EVAQ\u00a0to add an extra seat in its Challenger aircraft.\"We have constraints we have to deal with. So no, it doesn't always go as fast as we'd like,\" he said.He also stressed that EVAQ\u00a0makes 6,000 trips made per year, two-thirds\u00a0of which are on Dash-8 shuttles, which have accepted caregivers to accompany patients for several years.Pediatric emergency physician Dr. Samir\u00a0Shaheen-Hussain, one of the doctors to bring attention to the issue, said he has seen an improvement in services since \"the unwritten rule of having a flight attendant accompany a caregiver has been revoked.\"\"It is very encouraging to see that the demands made by these communities are finally being acted upon, and that the longstanding practice of systematically separating these kids from their families is coming to a definitive end,\" Dr. Shaheen-Hussain\u00a0told CBC\u00a0News in an e-mail.Inquiry commissioner Jacques Viens encouraged EVAQ\u00a0to continue upgrading its services, including to translate\u00a0its pamphlets and policies into Indigenous languages.\"A policy can be brilliant, but you have to explain it in a way that is, as well,\" he said.\u00a0Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
