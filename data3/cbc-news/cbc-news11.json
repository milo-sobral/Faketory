While plans are already well underway for light rail service to come to the city, both Fassbender\u00a0and\u00a0van den\u00a0Broek\u00a0want to see SkyTrain\u00a0extended instead.Langley City\u00a0elected six councillors:\u00a0Nathan Pachal,\u00a0Rosemary Wallace,\u00a0Paul Albrecht,\u00a0Gayle Martin,\u00a0Rudy Storteboom\u00a0and\u00a0Teri James.In Langley Township, Mayor\u00a0Jack Froese\u00a0was re-elected, beating\u00a0challengers\u00a0Alex Joehl\u00a0and\u00a0Anna Remenik.Township voters elected eight councillors: David Davis,\u00a0Eric Woodward,\u00a0Kim Richter,\u00a0Bob Long,\u00a0Blair Whitmarsh,\u00a0Steve Ferguson,\u00a0Petrina Arnason\u00a0and\u00a0Margaret Kunst.Former councillor\u00a0Mike\u00a0Morden\u00a0has been elected mayor of Maple Ridge.With incumbent Nicole Read not seeking re-election, five candidates sought her job: Morden,\u00a0Coun. Craig\u00a0Speirs, former mayor Ernie Daykin, Mike Shields and Douglas Blamey.Politics in Maple Ridge have often turned ugly in recent years over the issue of homelessness.

Bill Dingwall\u00a0will\u00a0unseat incumbent John Becker to become the next mayor of Pitt Meadows.The\u00a0small city's race yielded some big drama.Becker and Dingwall\u00a0were not\u00a0afraid of taking shots at each other over character and management style.A flashpoint has been Becker's handling of the conviction of former councillor\u00a0David Murray's conviction\u00a0for\u00a0sexual assault.Other issues in this year's race include transportation,\u00a0keeping taxes low and\u00a0balancing urban development with the city's agricultural.Six candidates were\u00a0elected to Pitt Meadows council:\u00a0Nicole MacDonald,\u00a0Tracy Miyashita,\u00a0Mike Hayes,\u00a0Bob Meachen,\u00a0Gwen O'Connell\u00a0and\u00a0Anena Simpson.Former city chief administrative officer George\u00a0Harvie\u00a0was elected mayor of Delta and will\u00a0succeed long-serving Mayor Lois Jackson.Also in the running were\u00a0Coun.
