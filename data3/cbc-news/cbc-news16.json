{"id": "Carleton students vote to stick with national federation", "paragraph": "After a close referendum, Carleton University students have voted to stay part of the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), an organization founded at the university in 1981.The CFS is an overarching student union, with more than 60 local members across Canada.\u00a0There were 2,396 students who voted in favour of remaining part of the federation\u00a0and 2,134 who voted no \u2014\u00a0a difference of only 262 votes. There were 18 spoiled ballots.\u00a0The Carleton University Students' Association (CUSA) had wanted to leave the CFS.\u00a0\"Obviously it's disappointing to lose any referendum or election, especially with the work that we put in over the past year-and-a-half and especially the past couple weeks,\" said association president David\u00a0Oladejo.\u00a0Each student pays $16.74 in dues to the\u00a0CFS\u00a0as part of their tuition. In\u00a0total, Carleton students collectively\u00a0pay more than\u00a0$400,000 a year to the organization.\u00a0Oladejo said the close\u00a0vote shows some students don't entirely know what value the CFS provides to the university.\"It definitely shows that a lot of students want to see change,\" he said.\u00a0The next step, he added, is to sit down with the CFS\u00a0and talk about\u00a0how to move forward and that perceived lack of value.However, Oladejo said it's ultimately's\u00a0CUSA's\u00a0job\u00a0to support what students want \u2014\u00a0and students have spoken.\u00a0\"So moving forward, obviously [CFA membership] is something students voted for and that's something that we're going to continue to work with,\" said\u00a0Oladejo.\u00a0Nour\u00a0Alideeb, the Ontario chairperson for the\u00a0CFS, said\u00a0the close results have sent a message.\u00a0\"It's given a mandate to us for us to come back and continue to work on the campaigns and services,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Alideeb.\u00a0\"Because of the close margins, I believe that there's an opportunity for us to continue to rebuild our relationship with members and with the Carleton undergraduate student association. That's something that I'm really looking forward to.\"\u00a0Alideeb\u00a0said the CFS\u00a0advocates and lobbies for students' concerns at the\u00a0provincial and federal level, and they have strength because they connect students across the country \u2014\u00a0like\u00a0when\u00a0the federation\u00a0advocated for sexual assault policies on campuses.\u00a0\"I'm looking [forward] to really rebuilding our relationship with\u00a0CUSA, because in the past, we had a really great relationship and fought so many amazing victories,\" said\u00a0Alideeb.Alideeb\u00a0said she'd try harder to visit\u00a0different parts of\u00a0campus when she visits about once a month, since not all students pass through the same buildings.\u00a0\"I think now, really, it's about [educating] students into how to be volunteers and how to continue this work,\" she said. \"Even when I'm not there.\"The vote results are still subject to the verification of the voters list\u00a0and must also still be ratified.Krystalle RamlakhanKrystalle Ramlakhan is a multi-platform journalist with CBC Ottawa.
