{"id": "'I can't sleep': Friends of missing kayaker search river for signs he's alive", "paragraph": "The distraught friends of\u00a027-year-old Alexander Okonski\u00a0continue\u00a0to search\u00a0for him, three days\u00a0after his abandoned kayak turned up along\u00a0the Ottawa River shoreline.Ottawa police asked for public assistance earlier this week when Okonski's kayak and paddle were\u00a0found Wednseday morning near the Britannia Water Purification Plant.Police describe\u00a0Okonski\u00a0as a white male with an athletic build who\u00a0was\u00a0last seen wearing a camouflage jacket and black pants.\u00a0Friends say Okonski is from Ottawa, but now lives in Gatineau, Que.\u00a0\"He's a really good friend. He's basically my best friend. We do hunting, fishing, everything together,\" said Michel Lefebvre, who searched the along the Gatineau\u00a0side of the river\u00a0for hours Saturday.\"We're just walking the shorelines \u2014\u00a0hoping for the best.\"Lefebvre\u00a0said his friend knows his way around the outdoors, and he's looking for signs of a trail Okonski\u00a0might have made into the woods or a fire he lit.\"[I'm] very concerned, for sure. You know, I'm trying not to think the worst,\" he said.\u00a0\"You never know. He's a survivor guy. He's an outdoor extremist. \u2026\u00a0He would give it his all.\"Friends said\u00a0Okonski\u00a0is shy, but would always be smiling and laughing when he was hanging out with them.Another searcher, Emily Brown, said she's\u00a0been friends with Okonski for 12 years since they went to\u00a0high school in Ottawa's east end.She called him\u00a0a \"hardcore outdoorsman.\"\"It's his whole life, which is why this is so concerning,\" Brown said Saturday.\"He knows what he's doing, so if his boat is washing up, then that's why we're all freaking out \u2014\u00a0because something is wrong.\"\u00a0Brown said she usually talks to Okonski every day and was supposed to visit his house the night before his kayak was found.\u00a0\"We're all barely holding it together,\" she said.Brown also called Okonski\u00a0\"the best person I've ever known.\"\"I can't sleep. How do I sit at home and sleep knowing he's out there somewhere? You know what I mean? I can't. Can't sit at home. We all just have to go out,\" said Brown.\u00a0\"I can't think of one instance of him doing someone wrong or someone being mad at him ... of all the people for it to happen to, like, he's the one that didn't deserve it.\"Ottawa police say the case\u00a0is still open and Okonski's disappearance is not considered suspicious. They say there's\u00a0been a thorough investigation so far and that they've\u00a0been keeping\u00a0Okonski's\u00a0family updated.\u00a0Anyone with information can call police at 613-236-1222\u00a0ext. 2666, or give an anonymous tip through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\u00a0Krystalle RamlakhanKrystalle Ramlakhan is a multi-platform journalist with CBC Ottawa.
