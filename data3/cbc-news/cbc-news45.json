{"id": "Canadian Finals Rodeo kicks off in Red Deer", "paragraph": "It's the end of one era and the beginning of another as the Canadian Finals Rodeo kicks off its first year in Red Deer.Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum was home to the rodeo season finale\u00a0for its entire 44-year history.\u00a0The closure of the historic venue prompted a successful multi-year bid from Westerner Park and\u00a0the Red Deer and District Chamber of Commerce.\"It's going live today, so the dream is coming true in Red Deer,\" said the chamber's interim CEO Rick More on Tuesday.\"We're bringing people from all over and now they're making the journey to central Alberta instead of up north. It's fun, we get to showcase our city.\"Competitors in eight events, including steer wrestling and bull riding,\u00a0will be vying for $1.6 million in prize money \u2014 one of the largest purses on the Canadian rodeo circuit.\u00a0\"This is the difference for most of those people of whether they make a profit this year or not,\" said Jeff Robson, general manager of Canadian Professional Rodeo Association, the sanctioning body of professional rodeo in Canada.\u00a0\"I think the significance in the rodeo circles is extremely high. This is the best of the best competing from all over North America, so it's a pretty big deal.\"\u00a0The City of Red Deer also stands to win big after securing the event\u00a0for the next 10 years. Organizers estimate the rodeo will inject $25 million into the economy.\u00a0There was a lineup outside of the local\u00a0Lammle's\u00a0\u2014 popular vendor of Western wear\u00a0\u2014\u00a0before the store opened on Tuesday morning, as attendees purchased fresh jeans and boots ahead of the week's festivities.\u00a0The Parkland Mall location doubled its staffing\u00a0to keep up with the anticipated flood of customers, said manager Holly Murray.\u00a0\"It's great to see the town getting into the spirit,\" she said.\u00a0\"People come into the store in skater shoes and leave in cowboy boots.\"Red Deer's hospitality businesses are also feeling the rodeo boon. Hotels started fielding reservations as soon as Red Deer was announced as the new home of the annual event in January.\u00a0The downtown Super 8 hotel was only at half-capacity this time last year, manager Tyann\u00a0Neumeier\u00a0said. As of Tuesday, all 84 rooms were booked for the week.\u00a0\"I think it's great, I mean, it's giving the housekeepers here a lot more hours. It's giving the front desk a lot more hours. And I know that there's going to bring\u00a0so much revenue to\u00a0the City of Red Deer,\" she said.\"It's going to help a lot of people.\"Westerner Park is less than half the size of the Coliseum, with a\u00a0maximum capacity of 7,819 attendees. The smaller venue creates a more intimate experience for fans, said Robson.\"It's going to be electric,\" he said.\u00a0The rodeo runs until Sunday. A full schedule of events is available on the Canadian Finals Rodeo website. \u00a0\u00a0Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
