Randall can then be heard wailing.\u00a0Jurors heard Walker and Randall had broken up because she was uncomfortable with the close friendship he'd maintained with his ex-girlfriend.Randall said he was \"sad and broken hearted\" that Walker had left a\u00a0Strathmore\u00a0bar with another man in the days before the killing.Randall said he attended the funeral for the wife of a close friend on Jan. 5, 2015.

She was my friend. I never wanted her gone. I don't know how this happened, I can't understand, it just doesn't make sense.\"On Wednesday, defence lawyers Bates and Jennifer Ruttan will call a forensic toxicologist who will testify about the effects of drugs and alcohol on the body.
