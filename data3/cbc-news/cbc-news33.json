{"id": "Horizon works to reopen obstetrics unit at hospital in Carleton County ", "paragraph": "Pregnant women who would normally give birth at the hospital\u00a0were being directed instead to travel about one hour\u00a0to either the Dr. Everett Chalmers\u00a0Regional Hospital in Fredericton or to the\u00a0Edmundston\u00a0Regional Hospital if they went\u00a0into labour between Wednesday at 3 p.m. and Friday at 5 p.m.Dr. John Dornan said\u00a0a recent change in the so-called locum surgeons, who\u00a0fill-in at the obstetrics unit during absences or short-staffing, prompted the unusual step.One of the new locums\u00a0is not currently able to perform\u00a0caesarean sections, commonly referred to as C-sections, he said.Even when a delivery is expected to be low-risk, emergency situations can quickly arise during child birth and the hospital must have a contingency plan in place if a C-section is required, said Dornan.And while surgeons from across the province have been helping out, no one is available to provide that emergency backup\u00a0for the next couple of days, he said.\"We had hoped up until a few days even that we might be able to find someone to fill that gap,\u00a0but we weren't able to do that and so we're enacting a diversion policy.\"The locum will be learning how to do caesarean sections, and Dornan is \"hopeful of being able to give good coverage in the future.\"It is the first time the obstetrics unit has had to close \"in our recent history,\" he said.\"I think the key point is that we have a safe diversion policy.\"Meanwhile, obstetrical services at\u00a0the\u00a0Chaleur\u00a0Regional Hospital in\u00a0Bathurst\u00a0have also been \"interrupted temporarily\" this week because of a \"lack of nursing staff,\" the\u00a0Vitalit\u00e9\u00a0Health Network announced on Monday.Until Friday at 8 a.m., pregnant women in that area are being redirected to hospitals in\u00a0Campbellton\u00a0and\u00a0Miramichi\u00a0to give birth.\"The obstetrical unit at the\u00a0Chaleur\u00a0Regional Hospital\u00a0is still open, let's say, if a patient has a fever and she's not in labour,\u00a0she's still welcome to the unit,\" said\u00a0\u200bVitalit\u00e9\u00a0spokesperson Thomas Lizotte.\"And for emergency reasons our doors are still open, right? So we're not going to let a woman in labour, you know, at the door or say, 'You've got to drive to Miramichi or Campbellton.'\"But right now, Chaleur has only one nurse trained in labour and delivery for the day and night shift, when ideally, there should be two more, Lizotte\u00a0said.For safety reasons, expectant mothers are being redirected.Vitalit\u00e9\u00a0\"regrets any inconvenience that this situation could cause,\" Johanne Roy, vice-president of clinical services, said in a statement.With files from Information Morning FrederictonAudience Relations, CBC P.O.
