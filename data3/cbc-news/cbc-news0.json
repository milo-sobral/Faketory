{"id": "Kennedy Stewart elected mayor of Vancouver", "paragraph": "For the first time in more than three decades, Vancouver has elected an independent\u00a0mayor, choosing Kennedy Stewart from a crowded field of contenders.Stewart ran on a centre-left platform, promising that housing affordability would be his first priority.\u00a0He's pledged to emphasize\u00a0non-profit housing solutions for low- and medium-income residents, and to form an emergency task force to deal with the city's opioid crisis.The former\u00a0NDP\u00a0MP for\u00a0Burnaby\u00a0South was the\u00a0frontrunner\u00a0heading into Saturday's vote, but he was in for a tough fight against the\u00a0Ken Sim of the Non-Partisan Association (NPA) for most\u00a0of the night.\u00a0Vancouver, like Montreal and some other Canadian cities, has political parties at the municipal level.\u00a0It took until the final votes from all 133 polling places were\u00a0counted before Stewart could be safely declared the winner, with 49,812 votes to Sim's 48,828. Independent Shauna Sylvester wasn't far behind, with 35,537.It was a long night for everyone involved in this year's election.The polls officially closed at 8 p.m., but long lines at a handful of polling places meant the city held off counting votes until close to 9:30 p.m.It would take more than three more\u00a0hours before Stewart was declared the winner..<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kennedystewart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KennedyStewart</a> makes his victory walk up the podium. His win marks Vancouver's first Independent mayor in more than three decades. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cbcnewsbc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cbcnewsbc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cbc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vanpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#elxn2018</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vanelxn18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#vanelxn18</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TFamf0zzlb\">pic.twitter.com/TFamf0zzlb</a>The last time Vancouver had\u00a0an independent mayor was from 1980 to 1986,\u00a0when Mike Harcourt was in\u00a0power.Stewart will lead a mixed council, with no one party holding a clear majority of votes. Five NPA councillors, three Greens and one person each from COPE and OneCity were voted in Saturday night.\u00a0Returning councillor Adriane Carr easily captured the highest vote total of the night, edging out fellow Green Pete Fry.Remarkably, eight of the city's 10 councillors will be women. The total complement of councillors includes:Sim says \u201cwe had a great night\u201d and says we elected five women councillors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/npa?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#npa</a>.

Former mayor Gregor\u00a0Robertson, who decided not to run again, was on the Vision Vancouver slate.\u00a0In fact, the once-powerful party has been reduced to just one school trustee, Allan Wong, and he barely squeaked in, winning the final of nine positions by fewer than 400 votes.The next school board will include:The Green Party had a strong showing across all three of Vancouver's elected bodies, winning three seats on each of the park board, school board and council.Vancouver's new park board will include:Audience Relations, CBC P.O.
