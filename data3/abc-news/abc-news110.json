That's when a witness saw a man clad in all black with a yellow bandanna over his face approach the girl and force her into the green, 2003 Ford Expedition, police said.\n\nThe suspect then drove away in the family's SUV with Hania inside, police said. The stolen vehicle was located several miles away on Quincey Drive three days later, but Hania was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, investigators said there's no indication to believe Hania isn't alive.\n\nThe FBI, which has named Hania's disappearance its \"Most Wanted: Case of the Week,\" announced Tuesday that it had raised its reward to $25,000 for information on the case. The state of North Carolina is also offering a reward of up to $5,000, bringing the total possible reward amount to $30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities also released a handwritten statement in Spanish by Hania's mother, Elsa Hernandez, pleading for her daughter's safe return while dismissing the rumors swirling on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\"I trust in God that my daughter will return,\" Hernandez wrote. \"No one knows the pain I have in my heart. Despite all the criticism and speculation against me, I would never use my daughter\u2019s name in order to take advantage of this situation. I thank all those people who have provided me help.\n\n\"Please,\" she continued, \"if you know something, call. I ask everyone not to make absurd comments. For the love of God respect my pain. I only want Hania, my princess, back. I miss her.\"\n\nThe FBI subsequently posted a statement on Twitter in support of Hania's mother.\n\n\"Social media can be cruel. Hania Aguilar is still missing. Her Mother wrote this note to ask people not to say such mean things on social media. Support this Mother, her daughter was kidnapped,\" the FBI's field office in Charlotte tweeted Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nInvestigators are still trying to track down a man who was seen in surveillance footage walking in the neighborhood that Monday morning, around the time Hania was abducted. The three videos, which the FBI released earlier this week, show the unidentified man wearing light-colored shoes, a light-colored shirt and a hoodie.\n\nThe man is not considered a suspect or person of interest at this time. Rather, he's someone authorities \"want to speak with\" because he may be able to help investigators narrow down a timeline of Hania's kidnapping, according to FBI Supervisor Andy de la Rocha.\n\n\n\nAuthorities are seeking additional surveillance footage from anyone who lives or owns a business on or near Quincey Drive.\n\nHania is described as a Hispanic girl who is 5 feet tall and weighs about 125 pounds, according to the FBI. She has black hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing a blue shirt with flowers and blue jeans.\n\nAuthorities have set up a special tip line that anyone can call if they have information to help investigators find Hania: (910) 272-5871.\n\nABC News' Rachel Katz and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report."}
