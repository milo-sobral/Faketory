Beto O\u2019Rourke each sat down with ABC News\u2019 Paula Faris ahead of the November midterm election, opening up about presidential ambitions, the politics of immigration and President Donald Trump.\n\nCruz, who just two years ago was running against Trump for president, deflected questions about his 2016 campaign trail battles with Trump in his interview with Faris. At different times during that campaign, Cruz called Trump \"utterly amoral,\" \"a serial philanderer\" and a \"pathological liar.\"\n\nNor was he inclined to respond to Trump's campaign trail attacks on him.\n\n\u201cLook, I have no interest in revisiting the comments of 2016,\u201d he said -- calling the campaign \"bare-knuckle\" with \"hard shots on all sides.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Trump attempted to link the father of the Texas senator, Pastor Rafael Cruz, to Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\n\n\nFaris, who asked Cruz if he would consider Trump a friend or a foe, stopped short of answering the question.\n\n\u201cHe's the president,\" said Cruz. \"I work with the president in delivering on our promises.\u201d\n\n'A country to save'\n\n\nWhen Faris asked the elder Cruz if he had moved past the president\u2019s insults, he suggested that it was not the time to be dwelling on the past.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to save,\" he said. \"We have a state to save. And we need to put away our petty differences and stand shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump -- who has endorsed Cruz\u2019s campaign -- is scheduled to arrive into Houston for the senator\u2019s Monday rally. Cruz, in turn, said he would campaign for the president during his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nWhen Faris asked if the senator would say unequivocally that he would serve his entire second term, Cruz said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\nCruz has wavered on this point in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the 2020 presidential race drawing nearer, there was at least one thing opponents O\u2019Rourke and Cruz could agree on.\n\nO'Rourke told Faris that he does not intend to run for president, partly in deference to his family.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can't be out on the road for another two years. Nor would I want [to]. Nor do I think that's right,\u201d he said, in reference to his wife and two young kids.\n\n\u201cWe've seen the consequence of a junior senator who leaves the state to pursue the presidency -- leaves our priorities. our opportunities, our needs -- behind,\" O'Rourke said, in a veiled reference to the unsuccessful presidential campaign that Cruz -- Texas's junior senator -- ran in 2016.\n\n\"I want to make sure that I'm there -- every single day, for every single one of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith immigration taking center stage in Texas politics and a caravan of asylum seekers heading for the southern U.S. border with Mexico, Cruz believes law enforcement should intervene.\n\n\u201cIf you've got 4,000 people trying to cross illegally at one point, of course we should have the law enforcement resources to stop that,\" Cruz said. \"That's simple, common sense.\u201d\n\n\n\nO\u2019Rourke disagrees.\n\n\u201cIf things are so desperate -- in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- that someone would risk their lives to come here, then what can we do to improve conditions there?\u201d\n\n\n\nEarly voting in Texas begins on Monday."}
