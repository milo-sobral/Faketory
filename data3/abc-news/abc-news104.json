Derlunas II said in an interview with the newspaper that his comments were \"beyond a mistake.\"\nThe 58-year-old said he'd been drinking heavily before the show. Derlunas said the classic play set in a Jewish village in czarist Russia reminded him of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which prompted his outburst.\nThe comments sparked panic in the Hippodrome Theatre and a few dozen people began running for the exits. The scare came a few weeks after a gunman fatally shot 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue."}
