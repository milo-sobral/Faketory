They also chanted \"lock her up\" during Trump's references to a woman who admitted to falsifying rape claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Those claims were not considered serious by Senate investigators, and stand in contrast to the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\nDuring the rally, Trump baselessly told the crowd that if Abrams is elected, \"your 2nd Amendment is gone.\"\n\n\n\nAbrams has campaigned on increasing gun control in Georgia while \"having respect for the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nTrump also said Abrams \"wants illegal aliens to vote,\" a common criticism of Abrams referencing a video that surfaced of her saying undocumented immigrants are part of the so-call \"blue wave\" of Democratic voters expected to vote in this year's elections.\n\nAbrams refuted that accusation in an interview with ABC News' Deborah Roberts. \"I know that the only people who are allowed to vote are eligible citizens,\" said Abrams.\n\n\n\nThe president further riled up the crowd with references to the \"caravan\" of migrants moving from Central America towards the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"You saw last week I called up the U.S. military, we\u2019re not playing games,\" he said of the thousands of U.S. troops headed to the border just days before the midterm election. \"Because you look at what\u2019s marching up, that\u2019s an invasion,\" he said. Trump also accused the caravan of including criminals.\n\n\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold another rally on Sunday night in Chattanooga, Tennessee."}
