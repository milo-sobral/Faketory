Steve Scalise and Sen. Marco Rubio took to Twitter late Friday night and Saturday to disavow the group.\n\n\"I don't agree with Nancy Pelosi's agenda, but this is absolutely the wrong way to express those disagreements,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise wrote in a tweet. \"If you want to stop her policies, don't threaten her, VOTE! That's how we settle our differences.\"\n\n\n\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio also tweeted about the incident.\n\nYou are not helping the cause of anti-communism if you behave like the repudiation mobs Castro has long used in Cuba.

Maxine Waters, who in June had urged supporters during a rally to \"create a crowd\" and \"push back\" whenever they happened to spot a Trump administration official in public.\n\nPresident Trump has even sought to make a hashtag out of the attack line, tweeting Wednesday \"#JobsNotMobs.\"\n\n#JobsNotMobs! pic.twitter.com/U1suRW5j6G\n"}
