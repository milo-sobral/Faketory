She alleges she was unlawfully held for involuntary treatment at Yale-New Haven Hospital and hospital staff illegally gave her medical information to Yale officials.\nShe was placed on medical withdrawal in the fall of 2016 when she was a senior and reinstated in the fall of 2017. She graduated this year.\nThe woman's lawyer, Robert De Groot, said his client is seeking damages for Yale's violations of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, saying school officials did not \"assist or accommodate\" her for her depression and illegally denied her due process by forcibly removing her from campus.\nDe Groot accused Yale officials of forcing the student to leave school only because they did not want another suicide to spur more negative media coverage.\n\"This was not done to assist this young woman,\" De Groot told the student newspaper. \"This was done to protect (Yale's) own image from being tarnished.\"\nThe lawsuit also names as defendants Yale President Peter Salovey and other top school officials, as well as six unidentified university and hospital employees.\nAfter she was placed on medical leave, the woman appealed to Yale officials to let her stay on campus.\n\"Please let me continue to learn how not to be afraid, continue to grow and become an adult who is strong enough to make a better life for herself,\" she wrote in a letter. \"Please let me return to Yale and continue to help myself.\""}
