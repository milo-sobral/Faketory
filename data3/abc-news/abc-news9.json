Jake Smith of the Gwinnett County Police Department.\n\n\"Before they could even get to the vehicle the shots rang out\" from inside the car, Smith said, adding that such things don't happen \"99.999 percent\" of the time.\n\n\u201cThat it went this way, it\u2019s just tragic,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\n\nThis was the first police job for Officer Toney. Prior to working for our agency, he worked as a security guard. His immediate family lives in California.\n\nOfficer Toney was assigned to the South Precinct. pic.twitter.com/JKV5oOLD7K\n\nOne of the bullets struck Toney, Smith said.\n\n\n\nToney's partner, who has not been identified, was not injured and dragged the mortally wounded officer away for cover, Smith said.\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear where Toney was struck. He was taken to nearby Gwinnett County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\"What a chief wants to hear is that the officer is OK. And when I asked that question, that wasn't the answer I got,\" Gwinnett County Police Chief Butch Ayers said during an emotional news conference late Saturday.\n\nWhen Toney graduated from the police academy in 2015, it was Ayers who presented him with his badge.\n\n\"The people that worked with Officer Toney on a daily basis recalled a very jovial person who was dedicated to his job and dedicated to his community,\" Ayers said.\n\nThe GCPD officer shot in the line of duty has died as a result of his injuries. Efforts are ongoing to locate the suspect responsible. Media post is at Hwy. 78 and Killian Hill Rd.\n\nInitial reports indicated that the vehicle Toney and his partner were called to investigate contained as many as four people.\n\nFollowing the shooting, the car took off and crashed less than a mile from the shooting scene, Smith said. The officers returned fire, but it was unclear whether anyone in the car was hit or if any injuries resulted from the crash, Smith said.\n\n\n\nThe suspects fled on foot.\n\nOne suspect, Isaiah Pretlow, 19, was arrested soon after the shooting and charged with aggravated assault, officials said. Pretlow was nabbed after he allegedly opened fire on U.S. Marshals as they approached him, officials said.\n\nThe marshals were not injured while arresting Pretlow, officials said.\n\nAyers said investigators are reviewing body camera footage of the shooting, but did not specify whose body camera footage he was referring to. Earlier, Smith had said most of the officers in the department have body cameras, but not all.\n\nIsaiah Pretlow (in dreadlocks) has been arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault. Still at large is Tafahree Maynard, who is charged with Aggravated Assault and Felony Murder in connection with Ofc. Toney\u2019s murder. Anyone with information on Maynard should call 770-513-5710. pic.twitter.com/18w0JXV1VG\n\nFriends and community residents joined officers who worked with Toney for a candlelight vigil Saturday night at the Gwinnett County Fallen Heroes Memorial in Lawrenceville, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\"He was practically like a brother. He was over at my house all the time,\" Reginald Pierre, a friend of Toney's who attended the vigil, told ABC affiliate station WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Faul and Mark Osborne contributed to this report."}
