He didn't warn Georgians that their personal information may be compromised. He instead launched politically motivate accusations against his political opponents.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who with a victory on Tuesday would become the first African-American woman to be elected governor in the United States, told ABC News\u2019 affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta that Kemp was \u201ctrying to distract voters with a desperate ploy.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s gubernatorial forecast listed the Georgia race as a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d with both candidates projected to receive just shy of 50 percent of the total vote. President Donald Trump is scheduled to appear at a rally for Kemp in Macon on Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrian Kemp will be a GREAT Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams will destroy the State. Sooooo important, get out and VOTE for Brian!\n\nThis is not the first time Kemp has raised allegations about attempts to infiltrate the secretary of state\u2019s computer network. Just days after the 2016 presidential election, Kemp requested a federal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, citing 10 suspected unauthorized attempts by DHS personnel to penetrate the state\u2019s firewall.\n\nA report from the Inspector General of DHS released in July 2017, concluded that allegations were unsubstantiated. The investigation determined that the activity flagged by Kemp was the \u201cresult of normal and automatic computer message exchanges,\u201d and that there were no unauthorized intrusion attempts.\n\nVoting rights have been a central issue in the campaign over the past several months, and Kemp has resisted calls, including from former President Jimmy Carter, to recuse himself from overseeing an election in which he is running.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has been under fire for weeks after an investigation by the Associated Press found that more than 50,000 registrations, the vast majority from African-American voters, had been put on hold because data in their voter registration applications did not exactly match other government records.\n\n\n\nCivil rights\u2019 groups have sued Kemp over that so-called \u201cexact-match\u201d law and over allegations that hundreds of absentee ballot were tossed after election workers determined that the signatures on the ballot applications did not match those on file. Federal judges ruled against Kemp in both instances.\n\n\u201cHe twice this week was told by federal judges that he was wrong when it comes to voter suppression,\u201d Abrams said Sunday. \u201cThey forced him to restore access to the right to vote for those who are casting absentee ballots and those who on the exact match list. He is trying to rile up his base by misleading voters yet again.\"\n\n\n\nLater Sunday, Kemp\u2019s office released another brief statement indicating that the investigation into the state\u2019s Democratic Party was opened \u201cafter receiving information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page. We are working with our private sector vendors and investigators to review data logs.\u201d\n\n\"The Democratic Party of Georgia will stop at nothing to regain relevance and power in our state,\" said Ryan Mahoney, Communications Director for Kemp\u2019s gubernatorial campaign. \"In an act of desperation, the Democrats tried to expose vulnerabilities in Georgia's voter registration system. This was a 4th quarter Hail Mary pass that was intercepted in the end zone. Thanks to the systems and protocols established by Secretary of State Brian Kemp, no personal information was breached. These power-hungry radicals should be held accountable for their criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Jack Date and Jeffrey Cook contributed to this report.\n"}
