The Mexican federal police are handling this in a professional and humane manner.\"\n\nShe added in a subsequent tweet that she has been in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with her foreign counterparts in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, and that her department was monitoring the situation and ready to provide assistance if necessary.\n\n\n\nI have been in constant contact with my foreign counterparts in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Closely monitoring developments and providing any requested assistance.\n\nThousands of migrants reached the Guatemala-Mexico border on Friday, breaking through a fence on the Guatemala side of a bridge separating the two countries. On the Mexican side of the bridge, they were met by Mexican police in riot gear. Others, meanwhile, waded into the Suchiate River or took rafts to get to Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the migrants are seeking refugee status in either Mexico or the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mexican Interior Ministry said on Saturday that 640 Honduran migrants have requested refuge in Mexico. It also said that priority attention would be given \"164 women, some of them in advanced stage of pregnancy; 104 girls, boys and teenagers, who are from 3 months old to 17 years old; as well as older adults who have varying degrees of disability. This group includes a minor who traveled alone.\"\n\nPresident Trump threatened in a series of tweets on Thursday to \u201ccall up the U.S. military and close our SOUTHERN BORDER\u201d if Mexico doesn\u2019t do anything to stop the flow of migrants moving north.\n\nI am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S.....\n\n....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..\n\nThe president also blamed Democrats at a rally on Friday night in Arizona for the illegal border crossings.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, it seems that Mexico will continue to process migrants. The Interior Ministry said in its statement that migrants will begin the refugee application process at the country\u2019s National Institute of Migration, where their data will be collected, before they are sent to shelters that have been \u201cenabled for their accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government also released handout video of migrants on a bus being told by an official that they would be assisted in being processed for any asylum claims they may have.\n\nABC News' Amanda Maile and Joshua Hoyos contributed to this report.
