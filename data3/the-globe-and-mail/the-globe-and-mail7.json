{"id": "Canadians love living in the suburbs, so why aren\u2019t we building more of them?", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Besides being easier on the budget, the Suburban Dream also aligns perfectly with what most families actually want.Eric Chow/The Globe and MailCanada\u2019s National Dream, the modern edition, began in 1953. That was the year Don Mills, the country\u2019s first large-scale, fully planned suburb, began selling affordable, ranch-style homes north of Toronto. Immediately, middle-class Canadian families yearning for their own bit of heaven \u2013 a yard, a garage and room for the children to play \u2013 began packing their bags for the burbs.And almost as quickly, folks who claimed to know better were complaining about it. In 1954, a national report by Maclean\u2019s titled Why Live in the Suburbs? highlighted a litany of social, environmental, economic and congestion problems arising from these newfangled housing developments: \u201cMile upon mile it sprawls, subdivision after subdivision, and\u2026there is no sign it will stop,\u201d the author groused. One expert in the article called the suburbs \u201ca ghastly mess.\u201dNot much has changed in 65 years. People are still flocking to the suburbs. And the experts are still complaining about it. But after more than half a century, isn't it time to finally admit Canadians would simply rather live in the burbs and figure out how to make that happen?Story continues below advertisementEarlier this year, the Council of Canadian Urbanism announced 67% of all Canadians live in what it calls \u201cauto suburbs,\" meaning low-density housing where a car is necessary to get around. \u201cActive cores\u201d \u2013 downtown areas where high-rises and transit dominate \u2013 constitute a mere 14% of the country\u2019s population. And almost all the new growth over the past decade has occurred in car-centric suburban areas. \u201c[Big-city] downtowns may be full of new condo towers, but there is five times as much population growth on the suburban edges,\u201d the report observes.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d states David Gordon, one of the authors of the report and a professor at Queen\u2019s University\u2019s School of Urban and Regional Planning. \u201cAs a professional planner, I know the subject of urban sprawl has been on the radar for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cYet we are still getting a lot more of it.\u201d His report hammers a long list of social, environmental, economic and congestion problems tied to suburban development that can only be solved by discouraging further expansion. \u201cThe suburbs have a sustainability problem,\u201d Gordon firmly declares. His list of unsustainable problems is almost identical to the one critics laid at the feet of the suburbs decades ago.While Gordon's work adopts a usefully rigorous approach to estimating the size and growth of Canada's suburbs, it drops any pretense to science or logic when assessing their inherent worth. They're always a problem in need of fixing. Admittedly, suburban living creates significant issues around commuting time, energy use and municipal servicing costs that require careful consideration. But the suburb-as-pejorative routine is grotesquely overdone.More Canadians live in the suburbs\u2014and the burbs are gorwing faster too% livingdowntown in\u201cactive cores\u201din 2016% living in thesuburbs in 2016% of totalpopulationgrowth in suburbsfrom 2006-201679%90%91%Edmonton1,321,426Vancouver2,463,431Calgary1,392,6098%16%12%17%12%15%Toronto5,928,040Ottawa1,323,783Montreal4,098,92784%83%74%15%Growth in the numberof people living inmetropolitan areas(including suburbsand downtown from2006-20169%Growth rate in \u201cactivecores,\u201d where a highpercentage walk orcycle to work17%Growth rate in \u201cauto suburbs.\u201d where people commute by car8%Growth rate in \u201ctransitsuburbs,\u201d wherepeople are more likelyto use public transitfor workSOURCE: SCHOOL OF URBAN & REGIONAL PLANNING,QUEEN\u2019S UNIVERSITY; DR.DAVID GORDONMore Canadians live in the suburbs\u2014and the burbs are gorwing faster too% livingdowntown in\u201cactive cores\u201din 2016% living in thesuburbs in 2016% of totalpopulationgrowth in suburbsfrom 2006-201679%90%91%Edmonton1,321,426Vancouver2,463,431Calgary1,392,6098%16%12%17%12%15%Toronto5,928,040Ottawa1,323,783Montreal4,098,92784%83%74%15%Growth in the numberof people living inmetropolitan areas(including suburbsand downtown from2006-20169%Growth rate in \u201cactivecores,\u201d where a highpercentage walk orcycle to work8%Growth rate in \u201ctransitsuburbs,\u201d wherepeople are more likelyto use public transitfor work17%Growth rate in\u201cauto suburbs.\u201dwhere peoplecommute by carSOURCE: SCHOOL OF URBAN & REGIONAL PLANNING,QUEEN\u2019S UNIVERSITY; DR.DAVID GORDONMore Canadians live in the suburbs\u2014and the burbs are growing faster too% living in thesuburbs in 2016% living downtown in\u201cactive cores\u201d in 2016% of total population growthin suburbs from 2006-2016Calgary1,392,609Toronto5,928,04091%83%12%12%Edmonton1,321,426Ottawa1,323,78315%8%90%74%17%16%Vancouver2,463,431Montreal4,098,92779%84%15%Growth in thenumber of peopleliving inmetropolitan areas(including suburbsand downtownfrom 2006-20169%Growth rate in\u201cactive cores,\u201dwhere a highpercentage walk orcycle to work8%Growth rate in\u201ctransit suburbs,\u201dwhere people aremore likely to usepublic transit forwork17%Growth rate in\u201cauto suburbs.\u201dwhere peoplecommute by carSOURCE: SCHOOL OF URBAN & REGIONAL PLANNING, QUEEN\u2019S UNIVERSITY; DR.DAVID GORDONMany of the complaints Gordon\u2019s study heaps on suburban living \u2013 it leads to obesity, for example \u2013 have been disproven. (\u201cWe find no evidence that urban sprawl causes obesity,\u201d reports a study appearing in the Journal of Urban Economics.) Other gripes are purely ideological in nature, such as the claim that suburbs give rise to divisive politics. And Gordon\u2019s report makes no mention of key factors that might cause families to rationally eschew downtown living for a suburban retreat, like crime, noise and lack of space.Murtaza Haider, an outspoken and iconoclastic professor of real estate at Ryerson University\u2019s Ted Rogers School of Management, says part of the suburbs' reputational problem lies in the downtown mindset of planners themselves. \u201cThe underlying philosophy of urban planning has always been that suburbs are bad. They are never recognized as having any virtue,\u201d he says. Yet it\u2019s hard to imagine anything being this popular without having a few arguments in its favour.Chief among those virtues is price. \u201cThe suburbs are affordable,\u201d says Haider bluntly, pointing out that rents in downtown Toronto are double those in the outer ring of the Greater Toronto Area. Anyone truly concerned about housing affordability ought to be a tireless advocate for more suburban development on cheap and plentiful farmland.Besides being easier on the budget, the Suburban Dream also aligns perfectly with what most families actually want. \u201cWhenever you ask people what kind of house they\u2019d like, the majority view \u2013 without exception \u2013 is a single-family detached home,\u201d says Haider. In the most recent survey of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., nearly two-thirds of all prospective homebuyers say a single-detached house is their preferred option.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementThe suburbs also seem to improve your mood. Work published earlier this year by University of British Columbia economist John Helliwell finds a strong correlation among lower housing prices, lower-density housing and selfreported happiness. \u201cLife is significantly less happy in urban areas,\u201d his study concludes. While rural residents are the happiest of all, people living in suburb-heavy cities such as Calgary, Oshawa and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res are also high on the leaderboard. Hyper-dense Vancouver, a city Gordon considers the \u201cposter child\u201d for good urban planning and intensification, is the unhappiest place in the country. It\u2019s also Canada\u2019s least affordable city.People like living in the suburbs. They really, really like it.Yes, commuting times can be brutal, and suburban residents may consume more energy per capita than city dwellers, but the situation isn't universally grim.According to Infinite Suburbia, a global research project seeking to change professional opinions about the suburbs, low-density living offers not only congenial and affordable housing for the masses but also some unheralded environmental and social benefits.Suburban backyards, for example, provide a greater diversity of species and habitat than some natural ecosystems. These ample landscapes also permit better wetland protection than dense, paved-over urban areas. And despite claims that the suburbs are endless, soul destroying rows of homogeneity, the Canadian experience proves them to be lively and welcoming destinations that are especially attractive to minority and immigrant families seeking upward mobility and their share of our collective national dream.With suburban growth still going strong after 65 years, urban planners and the rest of the \u201cexpert\u201d community should stop vilifying the suburbs and instead learn how to embrace and improve them. The suburbs make people very happy. Let\u2019s have more of them.Story continues below advertisementCorrection: Several figures as well as the source provided for the infographic associated with this article were incorrect and have been updated.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
