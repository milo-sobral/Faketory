{"id": "She was eight months behind on her rent. Instead of kicking her out, the landlord issued a challenge ", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Kiana \"Rookz\" Eastmond poses for a photograph outside Sandbox Studios in Toronto on Wednesday, September 26, 2018. Christopher KatsarovBack in 2013, Kiana \u201cRookz\u201d Eastmond, then 24, had perfected the art of \u201cdodging\u201d her landlord. \u201cI\u2019d see his car and I\u2019d be, like, \u2018Nobody move!\u2019\u201d recalls the owner of sound recording facility, Sandbox Studios.At the time, she was leasing a 400-square-foot sound studio in Toronto\u2019s Cabbagetown and she owed her landlord money. He\u2019d already shown his willingness to take chances on her, and she knew she was pushing the limits of his faith. Little did she know that the man she was avoiding might soon become not just a landlord, but a mentor.As she describes it, she and Paul Copeland couldn\u2019t be more different. He was 72 at the time they met and a well-known lawyer and member of the Order of Canada.Story continues below advertisementMs. Eastmond was a high-school dropout who\u2019s not exactly a buttoned-down business type \u2013 for a recent interview she was sporting a branded ball cap, dark hoodie and high-top sneakers. The way she presents herself and, she says, the fact that she\u2019s black, limited her options when she was seeking spaces to lease. Before she found a home for her studio, she had gone to see about 15 or 20 spaces and always been rejected.\u201cThey assumed because I\u2019m black I only work with rappers,\u201c she says. \"I would speak to people over the phone and they would be really excited. But when I showed up, they\u2019d say, \u2018We don\u2019t want rappers here,\u2019\u201d she says.Mr. Copeland was different. The lawyer, who had taken on social-justice causes over the years, such as the fight against police carding, seemed friendly. He asked her about her life and her work, and then rented to her.But just a few months after Ms. Eastmond moved in, her life fell apart. She\u2019d quit a good-paying job to become a music manager and then had a very public falling out with the soul singer who was her primary client. \u201cI was blackballed from the urban music scene,\u201d she says. The upshot: she had no job and no clients.When she couldn\u2019t pay the rent on her apartment, she gave it up and slept in the studio. She was barely eating. \u201cI was so depressed I was hospitalized for five weeks,\u201d says Ms. Eastmond. When a city-wide flood damaged her sound equipment and caused a mould problem in her studio, she couldn\u2019t afford to fix it. And for eight months, she couldn\u2019t pay the studio\u2019s rent.Kiana 'Rookz' Eastmond, left, and Paul Copeland outside Sandbox Studios in Toronto on Sept. 26, 2018. Christopher Katsarov/Globe and MailFalling $8,000 behind in rent, which seemed to her an insurmountable sum to pay back, she simply avoided him. When she finally ran into Mr. Copeland, who lived in the building, \u201cI almost felt a sense of relief that he was finally going to evict me,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least I wasn\u2019t quitting. I\u2019m not a quitter.\u201dBut Mr. Copeland didn\u2019t react the way she expected. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked. She opened up and told him the truth. \u201cI cried,\u201d she says. He didn\u2019t offer advice or a shoulder to cry on. He tossed the ball back in her court. \"Figure it out,\u201d he told her. \u201cI want you to do what you told me you were going to do with this space.\u201dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementWhen one of the biggest challenges small business owners face is the struggle to pay the rent, a landlord willing to show some leeway meant Ms. Eastmond\u2019s business had the chance to survive, and grow.Listen: I\u2019ll Go First: A podcast about the people behind Canadian startupsMr. Copeland is pragmatic about his response. \u201cThe place was a mess,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have rented it out to someone else in that state.\u201d And, he admits, he sympathized with her predicament. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the guy who kicked her out. She had a fairly difficult upbringing and I wanted to be supportive of a young person trying to establish herself.\u201dIt was the impetus Ms. Eastmond needed. She changed strategies. Instead of trying to use her connections to help create the next major artist, she opted to fill an unmet need in the marketplace by offering individual services usually associated with a record label to independent musicians and sound engineers. They could use her studio space, and get help with marketing, public relations and production - all for a fee.She steadily built her clientele even as she juggled three jobs to pay the bills. \u201cI really wanted to repay Paul\u2019s faith in me,\u201d she says. When she was accepted into the MaRS Studio Y fellowship for young entrepreneurs, she got a stipend of $2,500 a month. That cash went directly to current and unpaid rent. \u201cI was living on tuna,\u201d she says. But less than a year later, she owed just $1,000. And Mr. Copeland waived it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he told her. Retelling the story several weeks ago with Mr. Copeland sitting across from her prompts Ms. Eastmond to tear up. \u201cWho does that?\u201d she asks. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t need the money,\u201d Mr. Copeland responds wryly.Story continues below advertisementThe two ultimately became friends, hanging out and going to movies and concerts. He enjoyed her youth and energy. \u201cI taught her about music,\u201d he says. They both laugh. \u201cNo really,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has this insane music collection, with slave hymns and gospel music.\u201d He would drop by the studio and chat easily with whoever happened to be there.Certainly, Mr. Copeland became a bit of a business mentor for Ms. Eastmond. \u201cHe was polite but firm,\u201d she says. If she was 50 cents short on the rent, he would point it out. \u201cI think that\u2019s a huge gap in the black community. We don\u2019t learn about money or business. A lot of us are first generation [immigrants].\"After six years as Mr. Copeland\u2019s tenant, in February, Ms. Eastmond moved to a larger facility on Carlaw Avenue. It has both a sound and video/photography studio that doubles as an event space. And it represents another big leap for her \u2013 the rent is higher, she has more studio time to fill and she doesn\u2019t have Mr. Copeland in her corner. \u201cIt\u2019s likely going to be another year or two before we\u2019re thriving,\u201d she says.Ms. Eastmond still faces some of the same challenges. \u201cEven when I walked into this space today, people were filming in the front and they were like, \u2018Are you lost?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI own the business, but there\u2019s an assumption made when you look at a young black person such as myself.\u201dThose assumptions go both ways, Ms. Eastmond admits. \u201cToronto is diverse but we also stay in our own pockets,\u201d she says. \u201cThis unlikely relationship I developed with this older gentleman, who is Jewish, well off, and a decorated lawyer changed the way I interact with other human beings. It taught me you can\u2019t make assumptions. And it opened up my world and helped me feel more comfortable with people who don\u2019t look like me.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
