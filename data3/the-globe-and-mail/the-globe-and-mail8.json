If Johnson accepts the reduced damages, the final verdict would order Monsanto to pay a total of $78 million, split equally between compensatory and punitive damages.Bolanos\u2019 Monday decision is a turnaround from a previous tentative ruling she issued on Oct. 10.In that preliminary order, Bolanos said she was considering ordering a new trial on punitive damages, saying Johnson had failed to meet his burden of producing clear and convincing evidence of malice or oppression by Monsanto, a requirement for allowing a jury to award punitive damages.But following that tentative ruling, at least five of the jurors who delivered the Aug. 10 verdict sent letters to the judge, urging her to uphold their decision. Bolanos did not directly refer to the jurors\u2019 letters in her Monday ruling, but said the jury was entitled to its findings.In September 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found that the chemical was not a likely carcinogen to humans.However, in 2015, the cancer unit of the World Health Organisation classified glyphosate as \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201dStory continues below advertisementJohnson\u2019s case, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, that he alleged was caused by years of glyphosate exposure.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
