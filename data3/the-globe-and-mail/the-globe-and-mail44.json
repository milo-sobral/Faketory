Davidson remains with the team as a scout. Canada is competing in the Four Nations Cup tournament in Saskatoon.This interview has been edited and condensed for space.What has surprised you most about the job?Story continues below advertisementThe many balls that are in the air at all times. There\u2019s just so many little things. Just the administrative work and all of those things you have to think about. Certainly grew a huge appreciation for Mel. Just understanding how the whole organization works is a steep learning curve. I go home and my head is always spinning, \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019ve got to remember that.\u2019 The team aspect, I think there\u2019s nothing that came as a surprise being part of teams for many years in different roles.What is a typical game day for you at the Four Nations Cup here in Saskatoon?If we have a skate, I would go to the rink with a team. I spend most of my mornings doing some of the office work I\u2019m leaving behind, athlete agreements and following up with e-mails. Once I get to the rink, I sit in the coaches\u2019 room and hear a little bit of their prep before the game. Then I head to the stands to watch the game. I don\u2019t go to the dressing room between periods. I stay up top with Mel. After the game, we meet as a staff. We discuss the game, we rank the players. We have a postgame meal and get together with the staff and make sure they have everything they need for the next day. I would love to say I work out. I did go on one run when I got here, which is probably my first run in three years.How much pressure do you feel in this job? How did your experience as a national team player prepare you to handle it?It\u2019s a very similar feeling as a player. You have less control in this position, but it\u2019s the same feeling. It\u2019s the same type of desire to win I had as an athlete. As soon as you\u2019ve worn the jersey once in your life, you always have that pride, that chip on your shoulder, that competitiveness that, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ve got to win this.\u2019 That never dies. The fact I get to be a small part of it is something I find great pleasure and honour in for sure.What is the No. 1 lesson Melody Davidson taught you, both as your coach in the 2006 and 2010 Olympics and as the person who groomed you for this position?I would say two things. At the 2010 Olympics, the last year I played for Mel, she talked about the process a lot. That gold-medal game, her pregame speech had nothing to do with the results. It was about having gold-medal performances. I know I talk about winning a lot, but there is a huge process in place and that\u2019s where the focus needs to be. What you do today impacts tomorrow. I\u2019ve applied that in various areas of my life, but now it\u2019s certainly in the back of my mind. The second one: Working alongside of Mel is details. She always had this great vision for what it may look like eight years down the road and a great understanding of the details that go into it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as detailed as she is. I\u2019m trying to catch up to her in that aspect.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementDo you still play, even for fun?I actually stopped cold turkey when I retired. I got into coaching with the Okanagan Academy and I got my hockey fix when I coached. I always put shin pads on so I could jump in on drills. I used to teach skills for Calgary-based athletes twice a week which got me out of the office and on the ice. It\u2019s this year that I won\u2019t be going on the ice. I think I will miss that aspect. There\u2019s no doubt about it.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community. This is a space where subscribers can engage with each other and Globe staff.
