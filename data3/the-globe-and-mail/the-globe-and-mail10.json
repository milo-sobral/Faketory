{"id": "Why Hebron has a leg up on Alberta\u2019s oil sands", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Shaun RobinsonIt\u2019s been one year since ExxonMobil\u2019s long-awaited Hebron platform off the southeast coast of Newfoundland started pumping crude from its first well. It took four years, $14 billion, 132,000 cubic metres of concrete and a few thousand workers to bring it online, and so far, it\u2019s churning out about 40,000 barrels a day, with the crude bound for markets in the U.S. Gulf states, Europe and much of eastern North America. Eventually, Hebron will drill 20 to 30 wells, and is expected to produce around 150,000 barrels a day.That doesn\u2019t sound like much when compared to production in Alberta\u2019s oil sands, which sits at about 2.4 million barrels daily. But despite offshore drilling posing its own dangers, Hebron has a big advantage over Alberta: Tankers are able to easily access it. With pipelines in the West over capacity and potential new ones mired in a political no-man\u2019s land, offshore projects like Hebron are seen as an exciting new play for foreign investors, who last year sold off almost $23 billion in assets in the oil sands. Indeed, Exxon invested in Hebron as a hedge against Alberta\u2019s oil sands woes, and it seems to have paid off. With an expected reserve of 700 million barrels of recoverable crude, the Hebron project is expected to operate for 30 years. As Newfoundland\u2019s fourth offshore platform, it will play a key role in the province\u2019s plan to double overall production to more than 650,000 barrels a day by 2030.Total oil production in Newfoundlandand Labrador(Millions of Barrels)1209060300NORTHAMETHYSTCAMEONLINETERRANOVACAMEONLINEWHITEROSECAMEONLINEHIBERNIACAMEONLINESOURCE: CANADA-NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOROFFSHORE PETROLEUM BOARD; DEPARTMENT OF FINANCETotal oil production in Newfoundland and Labrador(Millions of Barrels)1209060300HIBERNIACAMEONLINETERRA NOVACAMEONLINEWHITE ROSECAMEONLINENORTHAMETHYSTCAME ONLINESOURCE: CANADA-NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR OFFSHOREPETROLEUM BOARD; DEPARTMENT OF FINANCETotal oil production in Newfoundland and Labrador(Millions of Barrels)1209060300HIBERNIACAME ONLINETERRA NOVACAME ONLINEWHITE ROSECAME ONLINENORTH AMETHYSTCAME ONLINESOURCE: CANADA-NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BOARD;DEPARTMENT OF FINANCEProduction by Province (2017)  80.7%ALBERTA 11.7%SASKATCHEWAN 5.3%NEWFOUNDLAND 1.4%BRITISH COLUMBIA 0.9%MANITOBA 0.1%OTHERSOURCE: GOVERNMENT OF CANADAProduction by Province (2017)  80.7%ALBERTA 11.7%SASKATCHEWAN 5.3%NEWFOUNDLAND 1.4%BRITISH COLUMBIA 0.9%MANITOBA 0.1%OTHERSOURCE: GOVERNMENT OF CANADAProduction by province (2017)  80.7%ALBERTA 11.7%SASKATCHEWAN 5.3%NEWFOUNDLAND 1.4%BRITISH COLUMBIA 0.9%MANITOBA 0.1%OTHERSOURCE: GOVERNMENT OF CANADAWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
