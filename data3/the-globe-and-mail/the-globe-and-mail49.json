{"id": "Montreal satellite startup NorthStar Earth & Space inks partnership", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Montreal satellite startup NorthStar Earth & Space Inc. has inked a key space-research partnership to help it build a network of satellites and ground stations it hopes will change environmental monitoring, detecting events such as chemical shifts in farmland soil and unnoticed pipeline leaks.NorthStar will announce a partnership Thursday with the Space Alliance of Europe, which represents major Italian and French aerospace industrial groups, to help deepen the company\u2019s expertise in satellite manufacturing and the development of ground stations to receive data. The Montreal startup announced $52-million in financing in August, including from the government of Quebec, and said this week that the Space Alliance and the federal government\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund were also contributors to that funding round.The company plans to launch a \u201cconstellation\u201d of 40 satellites to circle the Earth in the next 30 to 36 months, each equipped with a suite of sensors \u2013 hyperspectral, infrared and optical \u2013 that would conduct chemical analysis of the Earth\u2019s surface both night and day. \u201cThose things combined bring information levels higher in a time when dimension, precision, richness and timeliness of data is more and more in demand,\u201d said Stewart Bain, NorthStar\u2019s chief executive officer, in a phone interview.Story continues below advertisementHe describes NorthStar\u2019s mission as \u201ccontinuous environmental management,\" offering a platform, open to application developers, to use predictive analytics to relay the consequences of the data for clients. Potential end users, the company says, could include farmers, who\u2019d want to be aware of field contaminants to take action before crop death; oil and gas companies, who could be able to detect small, damaging leaks in pipelines and repair them before they grow disastrous; and forestry groups, who could be notified of extreme dry conditions to pre-emptively make water drops. The satellites would also scan the planet\u2019s orbit for potentially harmful asteroids and space debris.The company would collect the data at three \u201cEarth stations\u201d in the Canadian North; Mr. Bain said that NorthStar has scouted six northern locations to house them, some of which already have existing stations they could use.\u201cNorthstar is a shining example of how Canada\u2019s space sector is driving game-changing technologies,\" said Danielle Keenan, a spokesperson for Navdeep Bains, the federal Minister of Innovation, Science & Economic Development. The ministry oversees Ottawa\u2019s Strategic Innovation Fund, which provided $13-million in funding to the company \u2013 part of the original $52-million announced in August, but which was not disclosed until this week. \u201cThis project will lead to more research and development, and more training in advanced technologies for Canadian workers and students,\" Ms. Keenan wrote in an e-mail.NorthStar\u2019s majority owner is Telesystem Space Inc., which is jointly owned by Telesystem Ltd., the media-and-tech holding company chaired by veteran entrepreneur Charles Sirois, and an affiliate of Rogers Telecommunications Ltd. The Arizona aerospace company KinetX Inc. is a founding shareholder.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
