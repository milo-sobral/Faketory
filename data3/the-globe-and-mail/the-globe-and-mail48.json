{"id": "Trudeau intends to work toward free-trade deal with China, despite clause in USMCA", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with journalists after the 33rd ASEAN Summit in Singapore on Nov. 15, 2018.Bernat Armangue/The Associated PressCanada and China will continue to work together towards an \u201ceventual\u201d free-trade deal, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.This is despite the country being a signatory to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which specifies that if one of its partners enters a free trade deal with a \u201cnon-market\u201d country such as China, the others can quit in six months and form their own bilateral trade pact.\u201cThis clause doesn\u2019t prevent us from doing what we\u2019re already doing which is indeed continuing to negotiate with China on an eventual free trade deal,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said in a town hall with students at the National University of Singapore.Story continues below advertisementThe clause, which has stirred controversy in Canada, fits in with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to isolate China economically and prevent Chinese companies from using Canada or Mexico as a \u201cback door\u201d to ship products tariff-free to the United States.\u201cThere is an element of transparency. We have to keep our partners informed on how we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Trudeau added.The United States and China are locked in a trade war that has seen them level increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other\u2019s imports.Under the clause, the countries in the USMCA must notify the others three months before entering into negotiations that could lead to a trade deal with an outside country.Mr. Trudeau said that he and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang spoke about more than just trade deals during their bilateral meeting in Singapore on Wednesday.\u201cYes, we talked about deepening trade ties, increasing flows of goods and services between Canada and China for the benefit of citizens and businesses on both sides,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.\u201cBut I also talked about human rights, the situation of the Uyghurs, we also talked about things that are difficult to talk about,\u201d he added, without giving details.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementBeijing has faced an outcry from activists, academics, foreign governments and UN rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uyghur minority and other Muslim groups in its western region of Xinjiang.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s comments come just moments after Reuters reported that Canada is spearheading a group of 15 Western ambassadors in Beijing to seek a meeting with the top official in Xinjiang for an explanation of alleged rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
