Indeed, the government documents do not mention any instances of harm coming to patients who received infused drugs at private clinics.Outside of Ontario, private infusion clinics operate in a similar regulatory void.In fact, when a complaint was filed with Health Canada in late 2016 alleging that McKesson, the giant drug wholesaler and pharmacy company, had improperly stored the IV drug Remicade at its chain of private infusion clinics, Health Canada officials spent four months trying to figure out which government body actually oversaw the clinics, according to more than 700 pages of Health Canada correspondence obtained through another freedom-of-information request.\u201cIt sounds like Health Canada is all good with the storage and transport of the medication, but they themselves don\u2019t appear to know who regulates the actual dispensing. That was their actual question to me,\u201d said a Jan. 5, 2017, e-mail from an official connected to the regulatory college that oversees nurses in British Columbia whose name is blacked out. \u201cI found it a little strange that they didn\u2019t know the answer to this.\u201dThe Globe and Mail obtained the Ontario and Health Canada documents as part of an investigation into how Remicade \u2013 an IV drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease \u2013 became Canada\u2019s top-selling drug by revenue and one of the most lucrative in the country\u2019s history.Remicade\u2019s arrival in Canada in 2001 helped to spawn a large private infusion-clinic industry that today exists outside the public health-care system. The clinics, which are operated by third parties such as McKesson but paid for by the pharmaceutical companies that make infused medications, sprung up when Canadian hospitals were slow to make space for patients who required a new generation of high-priced chronic-disease drugs delivered by IV.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the 2016 complaint against McKesson, a former employee alleged that the drug wholesaler had improperly shipped vials of Remicade to McKesson\u2019s Inviva chain of private infusion clinics, and that the vials were allegedly stored in \u201cbar-type\u201d fridges at the clinics, rather than medical refrigerators with temperature alarms and other safety features.McKesson, a company best-known for owning the Rexall chain of drugstores, said the allegations were untrue and co-operated with Health Canada\u2019s probe. Health Canada took no action against the company, but only after more than four months of back and forth about who had jurisdiction over what one inspector called the \u201cconvoluted\u201d file.In the end, Health Canada forwarded the case to the self-regulatory bodies that oversee physicians in British Columbia and in Ontario, where most of McKesson\u2019s Inviva clinics are located, even though the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) made it clear in a Jan. 26, 2017, e-mail to Health Canada that, \u201cthe CPSO does not regulate practices of clinics per se, and specifically, the Inviva infusion clinic[s.]\u201dThe CPSO primarily handles complaints against specific physicians. Registered nurses, who are governed by their own regulatory colleges in every province, usually insert the IV lines and monitor the infusions at private clinics, but the clinic operators also pay doctors to either be on site or on call, depending on what kind of medication is being infused.\u201cSafety and high-quality patient care are our top priorities,\u201d Darius Kuras, a spokesman for McKesson, told The Globe by e-mail. \u201cInviva practices ensure that qualified health-care professionals oversee the infusion process and comply with regulatory and industry standards in all markets in which we operate.\u201dThe CPSO inspects out-of-hospital premises where procedures are performed under anesthesia, such as endoscopy clinics and cosmetic-surgery centres, while Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Health inspects other designated independent health facilities, such as diagnostic testing centres. Infusion clinics don\u2019t fall under either oversight program, nor would they fall under a new, combined inspection program that the province\u2019s former Liberal government passed into law but failed to enact before losing office in June.Story continues below advertisementWhen it comes to IV chemotherapy, most is provided in hospitals, not private clinics. However, there are exceptions to that rule when oncologists and patients with robust private drug insurance want access to cancer medications that are not covered by the public system \u2212 something that most often happens when a drug is new or its use in a particular type of cancer has not been approved by Health Canada.In those cases, oncologists may refer their patients to private centres such as the Provis Infusion Clinic in downtown Toronto. Graham Vincent, the president of Provis, said his clinic is operated much like a hospital chemo day unit, with exacting standards for cleanliness and safety. Doctors, nurses and pharmacists \u2212 all of whom work most of their hours in the public health-care system \u2212 are always on site when patients are receiving chemo, Mr. Vincent added.\u201cI don\u2019t think of IV therapy as something that needs to be regulated,\" Mr. Vincent added. \"Where do you stop? What about home IVs? [The system] is doing thousands upon thousands of IVs in the home in a more uncontrolled environment.\u201dStill, in Cancer Care Ontario\u2019s May 25, 2017, briefing note for the ministry, it warned that the lack of formal oversight at the clinics could pose risks: \u201cPatients may be receiving treatment in private infusion clinics where concordance to CCO safe-handling guidelines (and other safety-related guidelines) are not assessed; patients may be receiving treatment in private infusion clinics that are not evidence-informed and not funded by CCO; patients may be receiving medications prepared by pharmacies within private infusion clinics that are not accredited by the [Ontario College of Pharmacists]; patients may be receiving chemotherapy when a physician is not on site to provide supervision.\u201dHowever, Leta Forbes, a medical oncologist with CCO and one of the co-authors of the briefing note, told The Globe in an interview that the cancer agency simply wants to ensure that private-clinic patients are receiving the same quality care they would at a hospital. \u201cI would like to know that what\u2019s happening in [public] cancer clinics is happening in these facilities. It quite possibly is, because we have to remember that most health-care professionals go into the business to deliver good care.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
