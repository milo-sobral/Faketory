{"id": "Business, labour groups split over changes to Ontario apprenticeship system", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks during question period inside the legislature at Queen's Park in Toronto on Sept. 17, 2018. Nathan Denette/The Canadian PressBusiness groups are praising proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s apprenticeships system, saying it will ease labour shortages, but labour advocates say businesses will shift work onto apprenticeships as a way of reducing costs.The provincial government on Tuesday unveiled the Making Ontario Open for Business Act, a bill that scraps many employment reforms introduced by the previous government. The new law would eliminate paid sick days, freeze the minimum wage for two years and allow companies to pay temporary or part-time workers less than full-time staff doing the same work.The bill will also change the apprenticeship system. It would increase the ratio of apprentices to trained workers, or journeypersons, allowed on a job. This change affects 33 trades in which apprenticeship ratios are required and set by the Ontario College of Trades after independent reviews that involve industry and public consultations. The bill also proposes eliminating the College of Trades, the regulatory and enforcement body for tradespeople created in 2009.Story continues below advertisement\u201cThere have been persistent challenges in how the skilled trades in Ontario are regulated, the amount of College membership fees that apprentices and journeypersons are subject to and the complexity of the rules,\u201d stated a release from the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.Stephanie Rea, the ministry\u2019s director of communications, said the bill\u2019s intent is to reduce regulatory burdens on all parties and to encourage more people to become apprentices. The province has promised to release a plan in early 2019 for phasing out the College of Trades.Business groups such as the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) applauded the apprenticeship system reforms. They said the changes would make it easier to hire apprentices and address a growing labour shortage.\u201cFor more than a decade, both apprentices and employers alike have been urging the provincial government to remove barriers to apprenticeship training,\u201d Plamen Petkov, CFIB\u2019s vice-president for Ontario, said in a release. \u201cReducing artificial ratio restrictions, which were eliminated in most other provinces years ago, will allow more young people to enter the trades and pursue a meaningful career.\u201dMany manufacturing companies have long been asking for these changes, said Ian Howcroft, chief executive of Skills Ontario, a non-profit that promotes trades careers to young people. He said there was \u201cquite a bit of controversy\u201d when the College of Trades was created.\u201cMany felt it was too unnecessary and bureaucratic while others felt it would professionalize the trades,\u201d he said, noting Skills Ontario doesn\u2019t take a position and will work with whatever structure is in place. \u201cIn my personal view, it was off to a rocky start from the beginning ... it had a complicated governance structure and it became a partisan issue.\u201dAs the rules stand, an employer must have a prescribed number of trained workers for each apprentice, with varying ratios depending on the trade. The worker-to-apprentice ratios are as high as 6:1 for certain types of electricians, while many are 1:1, including powerline technicians and hoisting engineers.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementHaving one apprentice train alongside multiple experienced workers was meant to \u201censure the safety and quality of on-the-job training of apprentices and as a way to provide for the future skilled labour needs of industry,\u201d according to the College of Trades website. In the new regime, all trades ratios will be 1:1.Ms. Rea said the government listened to industry\u2019s complaints about Ontario\u2019s ratios, which she said are among the most restrictive in Canada.\u201cReducing ratios would allow them to hire more apprentices and meet anticipated future needs for skilled tradespeople,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, a single consistent ratio requirement would reduce the regulatory burden on employers, modernizing and making the system easier to access and navigate for employers and workers.\u201dToronto & York Region Labour Council president John Cartwright said there\u2019s a long history of construction companies trying to circumvent quality and safety in the name of cheap labour, something the apprenticeship ratio requirements were meant to address. Now, he expects some companies will take as many apprentices as they can get, in the name of cost savings, with little regard for the quality of their education.\u201cFlooding the market with a whole bunch of apprentices is only about people who want to use them as cheap labour and not to see them trained to the highest level,\u201d he said. \u201cYou [will see] impact on both sides of the generations: older workers who will find themselves without work and younger workers will find the market flooded.\u201dMichael Grieger, owner of Define Metal Fabrication in Scarborough, Ont., said he wondered the same thing when he heard about the 1:1 ratio plan. \u201cThe training may be watered down,\u201d he said.Story continues below advertisementAccording to Mr. Grieger, the measures don\u2019t appear to address the immediate problem of finding qualified tradespeople. He said focusing on education would be a better strategy. There aren\u2019t any schools left in Ontario that teach his trade, precision metal fabrication, so his apprentice has nowhere nearby to complete their education. \u201cI find it\u2019s a very empty [plan so far],\u201d he said.Apprentice electrician Megan Kinch, who lives in Toronto, calls the 1:1 ratio plan \u201ca disaster.\u201d Competing with lower-cost apprentices, she said, is already a problem for newly minted journeypersons, who worry about getting laid off when they finish their training. \u201cI\u2019ve met plumbers who ... don\u2019t want to write their exam because they feel they can\u2019t compete.\"Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
