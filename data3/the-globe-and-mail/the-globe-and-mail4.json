That\u2019s according to a new report from Canada\u2019s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, who noted that despite the lack of national data similar trends can be expected across Canada. (More than 8,000 Canadians have died from opioid-related overdoses since the start of 2016.) In developing countries, reduced life expectancy is often due to early childhood deaths from infectious diseases. Health officials say that makes B.C.\u2019s trajectory \u2013 which can be attributed to deaths in an adult population \u2013 stark and troubling.This is the daily Morning Update newsletter.

His remarks came just a day after he said he was willing to freeze exports, as the NDP pressures the Liberal government to follow Germany\u2019s lead to punish Riyadh over its alleged role in murdering dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Referring to the 14-year deal to supply the Saudis with armoured vehicles, Trudeau said: \u201cI do not want to leave Canadians holding a billion-dollar bill because we are trying to move forward on doing the right thing, so we are navigating this very carefully and that\u2019s pretty much all I can say.\u201dJohn Tory is confident the Toronto ward results will work in his favourThe centre-right mayor is likely to benefit from the reduction of NDP-affiliated voices on Toronto\u2019s smaller 25-seat council. For one, that should allow Tory to follow through on his pledge to keep residential property-tax rate increases at inflation. The smaller group of NDP councillors and other progressives will be forced to woo centrists in order to defeat Tory and his allies on any key issue. Tory also noted that the fact he won majorities in every ward gives him a \u201cvery solid mandate\u201d for his second four-year term.Here\u2019s Denise Balkissoon\u2019s view of the Toronto election: \u201cAs expected, the shortened, chaotic campaign season and reduced size of council also reduced the chances that different types of Torontonians might access political power. Perhaps council\u2019s first agenda item should be changing the city\u2019s motto, because \u201cdiversity our strength\u201d is a joke, one so funny it hurts. Council remains extremely male, extremely white and extremely middle-aged-to-old, seemingly the exact opposite of the public it\u2019s tasked with representing \u2013 and has been doing an unimpressive job representing for decades.\u201dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementKennedy Stewart\u2019s plan for affordable Vancouver housing faces hurdles in every directionThe mayor-elect wants to build 2,500 below-market-rate apartments every year for 10 years, plus another 6,000 a year at market rates. But he\u2019s already seeing pushback from the region\u2019s developers, who say construction and land costs, plus new rent-control changes, make it hard to achieve those goals. Stewart will also need to win support in a divided council, where even his presumed allies on the left may call for tough deals with developers that require things such as providing low-cost units in order to get permission to build. The Green Party, which holds three seats, wants half of all new projects to be at below-market rates. But at the same time, Green councillor Adriane Carr says the public needs to be consulted before increasing density.Got a news tip that you\u2019d like us to look into?

Trudeau says the rebates will help offset the levy which will kick in on April 1, 2019. Here\u2019s how Ottawa projects things will work out: Ontario households will pay $244 in carbon tax-related costs, and will receive $300 in rebates; those in Saskatchewan will fork over $403 and receive $598; Manitobans will pay $232 and get back $336; New Brunswickers will dish out $202 and earn $248.Story continues below advertisementHere\u2019s our editorial board\u2019s take: \u201cIt\u2019s politically smart to hand carbon revenues directly to people, rather than to intransigent provincial governments. Doing so helps counter the federal Conservative talking point that the carbon tax is a revenue grab. \u2026 [But] voters might see their election-year rebate cheques as a kind of unseemly bribe \u2013 or, even worse, they might feel more burdened by higher prices all year than they feel gratified by the annual federal cash infusion.\u201dAnd John Ibbitson argues that carbon tax versus climate change will be an epic contest: \u201cThe Liberals have scientists and economists in their corner. The Conservatives and opposing premiers are appealing to a tax-weary and skeptical public. Who will prevail? This debate will occupy us, perhaps consume us, in the months to come.\u201dMORNING MARKETSMarkets mixedWorld stocks marked a sixth straight day of losses on Wednesday as fears about global economic growth kept sentiment fragile, with Wall Street tipped for a weak open and oil prices languishing near two-month lows.

Instead, they drive desperate migrants to increasingly use human smugglers. Smuggling in turn provides funds for transnational criminal organizations that also traffic cocaine. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has blamed violence in the region on these organizations, which cater to the U.S. demand for illegal drugs. Tougher migration policies increase their revenue, which in turn decreases U.S. security. \u2026 The government can pretend that tough policies will stop desperate people, or it can acknowledge that they will continue to come \u2013 legally or illegally. Providing a path to legal entry and status allows the government to monitor the flow of people, respond to needs of local communities, and screen those entering.\u201d \u2013 Sarah Bermeo, associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke UniversityCanadians love living in the suburbs, so why aren\u2019t we building more of them?\u201cCanada\u2019s National Dream, the modern edition, began in 1953. That was the year Don Mills, the country\u2019s first large-scale, fully planned suburb, began selling affordable, ranch-style homes north of Toronto. Immediately, middle-class Canadian families yearning for their own bit of heaven \u2013 a yard, a garage and room for the children to play \u2013 began packing their bags for the burbs. And almost as quickly, folks who claimed to know better were complaining about it. \u2026 Not much has changed in 65 years. People are still flocking to the suburbs. And the experts are still complaining about it. But after more than half a century, isn\u2019t it time to finally admit Canadians would simply rather live in the burbs and figure out how to make that happen?\u201d \u2013 Peter Shawn TaylorBlunt honesty may be one way for the Alberta Party to gain political traction\u201cYou don\u2019t often find political leaders answering questions with unflinching, unfiltered honesty. Today they have been trained to say as little as possible, as mundanely as possible. But once in a while, someone comes along who defies convention. Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel did just that this past weekend when he was asked by reporters to give his appraisal of the province\u2019s economic future without the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. \u2018We\u2019re screwed,\u2019 he said. While I\u2019m not sure the situation is quite that dire, Mandel\u2019s no-frills bluntness will be applauded in a province that appreciates straight talk. Making those types of provocative statements is easier when you\u2019re the leader of a three-seat political party, and not Premier. But right now, the only thing Mandel should be worried about is building his political brand and establishing a persona that is unique and inviting.

Houndr is the latest in a wave of dog-care apps which help owners find people in their neighbourhood to walk or pet sit. The cost is much cheaper than traditional services, with the payment meant more as a gift of gratitude. And if you\u2019re not a dog owner, but still want to spend time with one, there\u2019s even an app for that: Dogtime Community lets people pay a monthly fee to spend time with local pups.MOMENT IN TIMECanada wins gold in lacrosse at the Olympics(S&G and Barratts/EMPICS Sport)S&G/S&G and Barratts/EMPICS SportOct, 24, 1908: Not to brag, but this country has been the defending Olympic gold medalists in field lacrosse for 110 years. Canada, which first won a gold in the sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, repeated that feat on this day in 1908 in London. At those Olympics, which had started in July before taking a couple of months off, Canada fielded a group of men who are now considered to be the first Team Canada \u2013 elite players chosen from across the country. And they did the country proud against the only other competitor, Britain. Canada led 6-2 at the half, before the plucky Britons tied it 9-9. In the fourth quarter, Canada poured it on to win 14-10. (One of the players was Tommy Gorman, who would go on to be a founder of the National Hockey League.) Sadly for Canada, where the popular sport was the national game, the victory marked the end of lacrosse as an Olympic medal event. It was a demonstration sport in 1928, 1932 and 1948. The earliest it could return to the Games (no decision has been made) would be 2028 in Los Angeles. Canada would be a favourite. \u2013 Philip KingIf you\u2019d like to receive this newsletter by e-mail every weekday morning, go here to sign up.
