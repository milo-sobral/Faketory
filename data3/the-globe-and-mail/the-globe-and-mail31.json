{"id": "China Telecom diverted internet traffic in U.S. and Canada, report finds", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.China Telecom, a state-owned telecommunications firm, has systematically diverted internet traffic in Canada and the United States by shunting it through its own network in an effort to commit espionage and steal intellectual property, two cybersecurity researchers say.Yuval Shavitt of Tel Aviv University and Chris Demchak of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I., published a paper recently in Military Cyber Affairs, the journal of the Military Cyber Professionals Association, outlining how China has been rerouting Canadian and U.S. internet traffic via access points it has set up legally in North America, ostensibly to improve service for its customers.Although the Chinese government has signed no-hacking agreements with numerous Western countries, including Canada and the United States, to prohibit direct attacks on computer networks, the accords did nothing to prevent the diverting of online traffic on key Western internet infrastructure, the authors say.Story continues below advertisement\"China Telecom has ten strategically placed, Chinese-controlled internet \u2018points of presence\u2019 (PoPs) across the internet backbone of North America,\u201d Prof. Shavitt and Prof. Demchak say. \u201cVast rewards can be reaped from the hijacking, diverting, and then copying of information-rich traffic going into or crossing the United States and Canada \u2013 often unnoticed and then delivered with only small delays.\u201dGlobal Affairs Canada said Greta Bossenmaier, the Prime Minister\u2019s national security adviser, will raise the issue with senior Chinese officials at a security and legal affairs meeting in Beijing this year.\u201cCanada raises such issues with China regularly. The topic of cyber hacking will be a priority when the Canada-China National Security and Rule of Law Dialogue meets next,\u201d Global Affairs spokesperson Stefano Maron said in a statement to The Globe.Related: Foreign espionage of Canadian research a risk to \u2018national interests,\u2019 CSIS warnsForeign telecom carriers set up such internet access points in North America in order to serve clients in their home countries and to expand business opportunities. PoPs also make it easier for these telecom firms to influence the routing of internet traffic. China Telecom has at least eight in the United States and two in Canada \u2013 in Toronto and Vancouver, the researchers say.Using an Israeli-designed internet traffic route tracing system, the authors detected \u201cunusual and systematic hijacking patterns associated with China Telecom.\u201dOne such example the authors give is the diverting of routes between Canada and South Korean government sites. For six months beginning in February, 2016, internet traffic was diverted by China Telecom and routed through its PoP in Toronto, then forwarded to its PoP on the West Coast, then on to China and finally to South Korea. The shortest route for this traffic would normally have been Toronto to the United States to South Korea, the authors says. \u201cThat this pattern continued for six months is good evidence that this was no short term misconfiguration or temporary internet conditions disruption.\u201dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementThey describe what happened with the Canadian internet traffic as the \u201cperfect scenario for long-term espionage.\"Prof. Shavitt said Monday that similar attacks have been recreated from China Telecom\u2019s PoP in Toronto for shorter periods, including in 2018, when still more data being sent from Toronto to the South Korean government was diverted.\u201cIt is a company that wants to make profits, of course, but it is also owned by the Chinese government and it is used by the Chinese government for these kinds of operations,\u201d Prof. Shavitt said in an interview. \u201cThose malicious activities are a small fraction of their activity. The major activity is commercial.\u201dPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale\u2019s office would not comment on the study.The Communications Security Establishment, which is responsible for cybersecurity and signals intelligence, said it was aware of the report and that it takes any cyber threat seriously. The CSE said its new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security provides \u201cextensive guidance to help Canadians secure their online communications.\u201dChina Telecom did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa dismissed the Military Cyber Affairs report as \u201cgroundless speculation.\u201dStory continues below advertisement\u201cCyber security is a complicated global issue given the fact that cyber attacks are conducted anonymously and across borders,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. \u201cThe Chinese side calls for all parties to seek a common solution through enhanced dialogue and cooperation. Groundless speculation, hyping up or accusation is not helpful to solve the problem nor conducive to any party\u2019s interests.\u201dThe researchers \u2013 with expertise in electrical engineering and cybersecurity \u2013 say they discovered similar attacks on networks in Italy, Japan, Thailand and Scandinavia in 2016 and 2017, including traffic from U.S. locations to a large Anglo-American bank\u2019s headquarters in Milan that terminated in China. The authors say that after the data was copied by China Telecom for encryption breaking and analysis, it was delivered to the intended networks with only small delays.Prof. Shavitt said Canada and the United States should not be allowing China Telecom to set up PoPs in North America unless China allows Western telecoms to set up similar access points to internet infrastructure in China.\u201cThere is no regulation [in North America] about who can own internet infrastructure ... and this is the main problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very substantial and critical infrastructure that is not regulated, and the government should actually take action and regulate who can own it.\"The authors recommend that China Telecom be limited to one PoP in North America, which would be easy to monitor, but they also say it would be better if the state entity were limited to an access point in Hong Kong.Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party does not allow U.S. or Western telecoms to set up PoPs on China\u2019s national internet network, which means its internet traffic is protected from foreign hijacking.Story continues below advertisementProf. Shavitt said that creates a major imbalance in access between China and Western democracies, \u201cwhich allows for malicious behavior by China through China Telecom at a time and place of its choosing, while denying the same to the U.S. and its allies.\u201d\u201dSpeaking about the current imbalance \u2013 where China forbids U.S. or Western telecom firms from internet \u2018points of presence\u2019 in China,\" said Richard Fadden, a former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, \u201cin dealing with China, it\u2019s important to recall that what is good for the goose is not good for the gander. China often takes advantage of Western openness but does not reciprocate. It\u2019s true in a variety of sectors \u2013 trade, rule of law, etc.\u201dThe United States and Beijing signed an agreement in 2015 to stop conducting state-sponsored cyberattacks to steal private trade secrets and proprietary technology. Ottawa signed a similar accord with China in 2017, but the deal did not cover the hijacking of internet traffic.This is not the first time China Telecom has been accused of internet traffic hijacking. In 2010, the company denied allegations by a U.S. congressional watchdog that it had hijacked significant volumes of internet traffic by redirecting it unnecessarily through servers in China. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said on April 8, 2010, that China Telecom rerouted traffic sent to about 15 per cent of the internet\u2019s destinations, including branches of the U.S. military, the U.S. Senate and companies such as Microsoft Corp.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
