A vote will take place when Canada Post presents offers that meet our demands for health and safety, gender equality and more full-time jobs.\u201dAt the same time, Canada Post asked its international partners to halt mail and parcel shipments to Canada as it reeled under the weight of a delivery backlog that had grown to 30 days as a result of the dispute.The Crown corporation said on Friday that its domestic customers were also backed up with packages waiting for delivery as rotating strikes that began on Oct. 22 continued across the country.\u201cThe backlogs are also extending to international mail and parcels entering the country,\u201d Canada Post spokesman Jon Hamilton said in an e-mail.\u201cAs a result, we have been forced to request that international posts, including the United States Postal Service, refrain from shipping items until we can clear the backlog.\u201dBritain\u2019s Royal Mail, in a bulletin to its corporate customers, said it would hold any shipments posted to Canada within the last couple of days in its distribution centres \u201cawaiting further updates.\u201dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisement\u201cAs a result of ongoing industrial action, we have now been requested to suspend the dispatching of international traffic destined for Canada, from today until further notice,\u201d it said.\u201cThis applies not only to us, but all international postal operators,\u201d the Royal Mail added.A similar bulletin was issued by Hong Kong postal service. Online sales giant eBay said it also received a notification from China Post that it was halting deliveries.Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have been in contract negotiations for nearly a year, with no success.CUPW began rotating strikes across the country that have shut down postal operations in over 200 communities, hoping to pressure Canada Post into agreeing to contract demands, including better job security, reduced workloads and stronger health and safety measures.The walkouts have resulted in backlogs at the agency\u2019s main sorting plants, particularly in Toronto, where Mr. Hamilton said the number of mail-filled tractor trailers awaiting processing had reached 407 as of Friday. Dozens of trailers were also sitting idle in Montreal and Vancouver.Story continues below advertisementThe Crown corporation issued new contract offers this week aimed at reaching agreements with its approximately 42,000 urban employees and 8,000 rural and suburban carriers.CUPW said the latest proposals made positive steps, but not enough to put an end to walkouts, which rotated Friday through most of Manitoba, as well as communities in Ontario, B.C., Alberta and New Brunswick.The offers were time sensitive, with Canada Post imposing a deadline of Saturday, at one minute before midnight, for the union to accept them.CUPW wouldn\u2019t say whether it believed tentative deals could be reached by then, but said the union would not be held to an arbitrary deadline.Mr. Palecek was also critical of Canada Post for halting shipments from outside Canada.\u201cThere is no reason to halt international shipments,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLet us solve our issues at the bargaining table.\u201dStory continues below advertisementThe union said it wants concrete proposals for dealing with an escalating number of work injuries at Canada Post.Mr. Hamilton said the corporation has proposed a way for the company and union to work together to identify ways to make the workplace safer, and offered to fast-track a review of workloads to reduce overburdening of carriers who have seen a rapid increase in the number of parcels they have to deliver while letter volumes have declined.Earlier this week, eBay called on the government to legislate an end to the dispute in time for Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events tied to American Thanksgiving.The Canadian PressWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
