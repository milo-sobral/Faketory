{"id": "Red flags raised as Ontario reinstates doctor\u2019s note requirement for sick workers ", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.The Ontario government\u2019s proposal to reinstate the doctor\u2019s note requirement for staff who call in sick is welcome news to many employers, but critics say the policy overburdens the medical system and spreads illness.As part of the Making Ontario Open for Business Act, or Bill 47, the Progressive Conservatives plan to bring back the medical note requirement for employees. The legislation would replace the Fair Workplaces, Better Jobs Act, or Bill 148, passed by the previous Liberal government.The law now grants employees up to 10 personal emergency leave days a year, two of them paid. Employers also can\u2019t ask employees to provide a medical note.Story continues below advertisementThe proposed bill, which was tabled this week and could become law as early as next month, would give workers up to three days for personal illness, two for bereavement and three for family responsibilities. The days will be unpaid and employers \u201chave the right to require evidence of entitlement to the leave\u201d from a health professional.Sarah Letersky, director of communications at the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, said the government wants to create an environment where businesses can grow and create jobs. \u201cRequiring \u2018evidence reasonable in the circumstances,\u2019 including sick notes, is an employer work force and attendance management tool,\u201d she said in an email statement to The Globe and Mail.Many in the medical community argue that requiring employees visit a doctor to get a note puts additional strain on the health-care system. The requirement could also put others at risk of getting sick, in particular patients with serious illnesses and low immune systems.\u201cThis is a policy that will send more patients with uncomplicated viral illnesses into my emergency waiting room solely to get documentation so they don\u2019t lose their jobs,\u201d said Kate Hayman, an emergency physician in Toronto and spokesperson for the Decent Work & Health Network.Dr. Hayman believes the PC government is responding to anecdotal stories from business owners who reported staff abusing the no-note policy, but not taking into consideration the larger health and economic impacts.\u201cIt\u2019s bad health policy,\u201d Dr. Hayman says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good use of health care dollars and is shifting cost back on to the public system. For a government that talks about efficiencies, it\u2019s nonsensical.\u201dSome business owners are concerned employees will abuse the system if workers don\u2019t have to get a medical note as proof of why they were off work. Employers also say they may not always ask for a doctor\u2019s note from sick staff, but want the flexibility if they believe it\u2019s required.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementRik Ocvirk, vice-president of The Distillery Restaurants Corporation, poses for a photo at Cluny Bistro and Boulangerie in the Distillery District in Toronto on Sept. 20, 2018.Tijana Martin/Globe and MailEmployers, including Rik Ocvirk, vice-president of Distillery Restaurants Corp., reported a spike in people calling in sick once Bill 148 took effect in January. He says about 75 per cent of the 700 staff he oversees have taken both of their sick days so far this year, a higher rate than in the past.\u201cIt\u2019s a change people are unfortunately taking advantage of,\u201d Mr. Ocvirk says. \u201c[Bill 47] rights that wrong in some way and allows the employer-employee relationship to be something that is managed by them, not by a government.\u201dMr. Ocvirk believes most employers only ask for a note when they \u201cthink there\u2019s not a real sickness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just allowing an employer to have the ability to ask the question in order to hold people accountable,\" he says. \"The challenge for us is that [Bill 148] took away any ability for an employer to simply ask questions and have accountability of their own staff.\u201dOntario Medical Association president Nadia Alam, however, urged the government to \u201cthink of this in the broader public health context,\u201d in a brief e-mail statement.\u201cWith flu season upon us, prolonged wait times and hallway medicine, we need to find ways to keep doctor\u2019s offices free for patients sick enough to need it,\u201d Dr. Alam said. \u201cWe need to find ways to let people stay home to recover from minor illnesses.\u201dStory continues below advertisementShoetopia president Peter Mohr stands in his Waterloo store on March 28, 2018. Globe and MailPeter Mohr, owner of Shoetopia Footwear, which has stores in Fergus, Waterloo and Mount Forest, says he\u2019s considering offering two paid sick days a year for employees, even if it\u2019s removed in the new bill. But he will ask for a doctor\u2019s note if allowed again by law. He believes the notes prevent employees from taking advantage of paid sick days.\u201cIf the doctor says you\u2019re sick, we\u2019ll pay for [the day off],\" he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not, we\u2019re not paying for it.\u201dShoetopia offered some paid sick days before Bill 148 mandated it. When paid sick days became law in January, he estimates roughly 80 per cent of his 20 employees used their two paid sick days by the end of February.\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, we don\u2019t want you at work anyway because you\u2019ll infect everyone else,\u201d Mr. Mohr says. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
