{"id": "Why jobs and stocks won\u2019t help Trump\u2019s Republicans in the midterms", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.No matter the controversies swirling around his administration, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly points to two things as proof of his presidential success: stocks and jobs.Ten years after the Great Recession, the U.S. economy continues to churn out thousands of jobs by the month, and despite a recent pullback, stocks are broadly higher since Mr. Trump was elected two years ago \u2013 facts which the President is never shy to trumpet on social media.\u201cBest Jobs Numbers in the history of our great Country! Many other things likewise. So why wouldn\u2019t we win the Midterms? Dems can never do even nearly as well! Think of what will happen to your now beautiful 401-k\u2019s!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Oct. 21.Story continues below advertisementBut the electoral math is a tad more complicated. Neither jobs nor stocks will help the Republican Party in the midterms, if history is any guide \u2013 and a more reliable equation suggests Mr. Trump\u2019s side will lose its majority in the House of Representatives.Numbers aside, the U.S. midterm elections are a tough slog for any incumbent party. Since 1950, the president\u2019s party has gained seats in the House only twice, and on three occasions for midterm Senate races. A strong jobs market doesn\u2019t lessen the blow, either.On both occasions when incumbent parties gained House seats, the U.S. unemployment rate was south of 6 per cent. But consider the midterms of 1966 and 1994. In the latter, Bill Clinton\u2019s Democrats lost 53 seats, despite the jobless rate being at 5.6 per cent. In 1966, Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Democratic Party lost 47 seats, even with the unemployment rate at a scant 3.6 per cent. (The jobless rate is currently near a 50-year low of 3.7 per cent.)The situation is no better with stocks. We looked at the relationship between House results and the S&P 500\u2019s one-year change up to election day. The message is clear: Even if stocks are bolstering Americans\u2019 401(k) retirement accounts, voters don\u2019t seem to care.There are, however, some metrics with stronger predictive power. For one, there are presidential approval ratings. \u201cThat\u2019s not great news for the GOP,\u201d investment bank UBS Group AG said in a September report, when Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating was 41 per cent, according to Gallup figures. (It has since dropped to 40 per cent.) \u201cBased on this figure alone, it would appear that Republicans face a challenging landscape in November.\u201dStill, there are some historical outliers. Four years ago, Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating was a paltry 42 per cent before election day, though his Democratic Party lost only 13 seats. Circa 1958, Dwight Eisenhower had a robust approval rating of 57 per cent, and his Republican Party lost 48 seats in the House, with many crediting a brief but nasty recession for the result.A stronger gauge is to combine approval ratings with two other metrics: real disposable income per capita \u2013 essentially, the change in each person\u2019s spending money \u2013 and the deficit or surplus of House seats currently held by the president\u2019s party compared to its eight-election moving average. Admittedly, this is getting into wonky territory. But combined, those variables explain about 65 per cent of the change in House seats since 1946, according to research from Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementThat\u2019s likely bad news for Mr. Trump. In the second quarter, disposable income grew 2.1 per cent from a year earlier. Combined with Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating, the Republicans are slated to lose about 33 seats under Mr. Jacobson\u2019s model, enough to lose the House. (The Democrats must flip 23 seats, assuming they hold on to vacated party seats, to form a majority.) That said, the model has a hefty margin of error (13 seats), so the Republicans retain a sliver of hope.Current House breakdownCurrent House breakdownDemocraticDemocraticDemocraticDemocraticRepublicanRepublicanRepublicanRepublicanVacantVacantVacantVacantMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVCurrent House of Representatives breakdownCurrent House of Representatives breakdownDemocraticDemocraticDemocraticDemocraticRepublicanRepublicanRepublicanRepublicanVacantVacantVacantVacantMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVCurrent House of Representatives breakdownCurrent House of Representatives breakdownDemocraticDemocraticRepublicanRepublicanVacantVacantMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVMATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: HOUSE.GOVOne \u201cpeculiarity,\u201d Mr. Jacobson noted in a recent paper, is the disparity between a strong U.S. economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings.\u201cOrdinarily, we would expect a president enjoying very good economic numbers (solid economic growth, very low unemployment, low inflation, a strong stock market, and the rosiest public views of the economy in more than a decade) to have much higher overall approval ratings than Trump has enjoyed so far,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHis low approval ratings are thus eloquent testimony to how off-putting the rest of his performance has been to people outside his base.\u201dAs such, the Republicans need their economic story \u2013 one that goes beyond jobs \u2013 to overshadow a divisive president.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
