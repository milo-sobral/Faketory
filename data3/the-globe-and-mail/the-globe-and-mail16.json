A friendly, three-eyed green monster isn\u2019t far behind. No, this isn\u2019t some new trendy play space trying to compete with Chuck E. Cheese and the like, though there is one commonality: captivating games that hold the attention of young minds.At its core, Squiggle Park is a video game that teaches children how to read, but the educational program, developed by Canadian entrepreneurs Leah Skerry and Julia Dexter, offers more. It\u2019s an immersive platform with a cheerful interface that promotes literacy among pre-kindergarten to Grade 2 students \u2013 and more recently, adults learning English as a second language \u2013 by building confidence in reading through play.According to the Canadian Education Statistics Council, just half of Canadian adults age 16 and above read at a level deemed necessary to live and work in today\u2019s society. It\u2019s an alarming statistic, and one that pushed Ms. Skerry and Ms. Dexter to take action, in addition to their own personal experiences with shortcomings in the education system.Story continues below advertisement\u201cIn classrooms, teachers have huge, diverse groups of learners, but they\u2019re being asked to support them in a very personal way, which is impossible. It\u2019s impossible to scale,\u201d Ms. Dexter says. \u201cWe believe that if we can create innovations that help kids be driven to push their own learning that we can revolutionize how education is delivered.\u201dSquiggle Park was brought to market as a paid product in 2017, though research and development initially began in 2014. Currently, it\u2019s used in more than 10,000 educational institutions, including major school boards across Canada, like Peel Region in Ontario, Surrey Schools District in British Columbia, and all school boards in Nova Scotia. In the United States, Squiggle Park can be found in participating New York public schools and across the Chicago Public Schools district, the third-largest school district in the United States. Its reach extends beyond North America, too. Students as far as Oman, China, India, Vietnam, Brazil and soon Barbados use it to improve their English reading.Leah Skerry, left, and Julia Dexter of Squiggle Park, a Canadian EdTech company that uses video games to improve language.\u201cCanadian education content is seen as a premium product around the world,\u201d Ms. Dexter says. \u201cJapan, for example, has a one-to-one tablet program for preschoolers. So there\u2019s actually less reluctance to using technology with even the youngest learners in some of these nations.\u201dSquiggle Park isn\u2019t strictly used in school settings. Outside of the classroom, community programs such as the Boys and Girls Club of Canada as well as the YMCA have implemented the game in their programming, and parents can download the app onto a home computer or tablet.Earlier this year, Squiggle Park partnered with the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to help both children and adult English language learners improve literacy skills. The pilot program found that those who used the video game learned nearly twice as many new sounds as those who did not play, and on average, the pre-kindergarten players nearly tripled the number of letters they knew.The content is designed in such a way that players practice and repeat different skills, like phonemic awareness (comprehending the sounds of a word) and phonics (understanding the relationship between the sounds that letters make), to better understand words within each game. Everything is done at the player\u2019s speed and, as with the structure of a traditional video game, one progresses only once the current level has been mastered.While Squiggle Park is a Canadian company \u2013 Ms. Dexter is based in Halifax and Ms. Skerry in Waterloo, though she\u2019s spending the next several months in Chicago \u2013 the goal was always to go global.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisement\u201cWe decided to target the U.S. market right away by hitting the phones and calling principals in the U.S. to join a pilot program that we launched in the fall of 2016. The pilot had 1,200 teachers participate and there were clusters from specific states, including, Rhode Island, Texas, California and Illinois,\u201d Ms. Dexter says.Immediately focusing on the U.S. market helped to propel the business forward, but participating in startup incubators like Google For Entrepreneurs and Waterloo-based Communitech and its Fierce Founders accelerator program have also been critical in Squiggle Park\u2019s success thus far.\u201cIn these programs we were paired up with top mentors who helped us understand the value of focusing on our strengths,\u201d Ms. Dexter says. \u201cFierce Founders pushed us to think about how to reach real scale in our business by building sales and marketing infrastructure to succeed.\u201dSquiggle Park has since graduated into Communitech\u2019s Rev program, which focuses on accelerating revenue, and the company meets weekly with its mentors.With the company\u2019s co-founders living in different parts of the country, operations are not that of a traditional business; there is no brick-and-mortar office building with a Squiggle Park logo on the front door. But for an ed-tech startup, a strong remote team is almost expected, and technology plays an important role in how the team stays on track.Currently there are 15 employees, two of whom are based in the United States (an account executive and a developer).Story continues below advertisementWeekly video conference calls to review KPIs (referred to affectionately by the team as \u201crocks\u201d) and Friday check-ins to share highs and lows are strictly enforced. Twice per year in-person retreats with the entire staff provide invaluable face-to-face time.Squiggle Park is pushing boundaries in education, but not all Canadian innovators are as risk tolerant as its co-founders.Children work with the Squiggle Park video game. Educating adults on the value of meaningful screen time for children, meanwhile, is an uphill battle. 'Technology doesn\u2019t have to be a negative thing. It can actually be a quite positive thing if used properly,' Ms. Dexter says. \u201cCanadian CEOs have reported that their greatest barrier to innovation is \u2018risk and uncertainty,\u2019 which is rather ironic given that areas with risk and uncertainty are full of upside opportunity,\u201d says Elicia Maine, professor of innovation and entrepreneurship and academic director of the Invention to Innovation program at the Beedie School of Business, at Simon Fraser University in B.C.Most recently, Dr. Maine was on the Council of Canadian Academies\u2019 expert panel that researched how business schools can better promote and teach innovation skills across the country. (Findings were published on Oct. 18.)\u201cWhat we need to teach and role model more in Canada are the skill sets of how to manage under conditions of uncertainty, so that our ventures and established companies have the chance to profit from the upside of uncertainty, while mitigating their downside exposure,\u201d Dr. Maine says.Squiggle Park is profiting \u2013 it\u2019s on track to generate $1-million in sales this year \u2013 but it still faces challenges. Hiring outside of Canada is one.Story continues below advertisement\u201cThe competition for technical talent is fierce and to attract the best when you are a startup means you have to find ways to inspire potential hires about your vision and culture and then deliver,\u201d Ms. Dexter says.And while teaching may be the crux of Squiggle Park\u2019s ethos, educating adults on the value of meaningful screen time for children is an uphill battle.\u201cTechnology doesn\u2019t have to be a negative thing. It can actually be a quite positive thing if used properly,\u201d Ms. Dexter says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the global market is quite exciting because other countries are so much more advanced in terms of how they\u2019re using technology in education and how open they are to trying that.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
