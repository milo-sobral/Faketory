He ruled in Kandahar, the former Taliban heartland, with an iron fist and had survived several attempts to kill him, including one last year that resulted in the death of five diplomats from the United Arab Emirates.Security has been steadily deteriorating in Afghanistan, with increasingly brazen attacks being carried out by insurgents, and Afghanistan\u2019s security forces have been on high alert ahead of Saturday\u2019s elections.The Taliban have threatened the polls and warned teachers and students not to participate in the vote and not to allow schools to be used as polling centres.
