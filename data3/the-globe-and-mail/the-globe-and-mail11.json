For years, health professionals have recognized there are sex differences when it comes to heart disease. But they\u2019re only now beginning to learn that women also have poorer outcomes after stroke, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Women tend to experience strokes later in life than men, they aren\u2019t treated as quickly and are more likely to die.\u201cWe always thought they present the same. It\u2019s not like their symptoms are different,\u201d says Patrice Lindsay, director of systems change and the stroke program at Heart & Stroke. But within the past year, she says, research has shown \u201cthere are some significant gender differences, which has surprised us, worried us and motivated us.\u201dOne of the studies presented in Montreal, co-authored by Lindsay, examined administrative data on more than 388,000 Canadian hospital admissions for stroke between 2003 and 2016. It found mortality is higher in women over the age of 45 than in men.Another study, conducted by researchers in Australia, found women died more often than men within the first year after a stroke.And yet another study, led by Thalia Field of the Vancouver Stroke Program, found Canadian women were less likely than men to receive the clot-busting drug alteplase for ischemic stroke. Those who did receive it waited an average of 14 minutes longer than men between the time they entered hospital and the time they were given the drug \u2013 a significant time gap since the treatment must be given quickly to curb brain-cell death.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementFor the study, Field and her colleagues examined data for nearly 260,000 Canadian stroke patients between 2009 and 2016. They found women were also more likely to die within seven days of their stroke.Field, a neurologist and assistant professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia, says more research is needed to understand the reasons for these discrepancies. Some of these differences are biological, she says. Since women tend to be older than men when they experience stroke, they may have more illnesses, and they may be more frail and less likely to recover. But there are also social and cultural factors. Women are more likely to outlive their husbands, and thus, may be living alone when they have a stroke, Field says. This could make them less likely to seek timely treatment or have anyone to support them in recovery.But even though researchers have yet to tease out the \u201cwhys,\u201d scientists and clinicians should be considering these sex differences and thinking about the barriers female patients face, and how they can improve care, Field says.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to get people\u2019s attention so that they\u2019re aware of it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat will affect both clinical care as well as research awareness into looking further into what the underlying reasons are and how we can correct them.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
