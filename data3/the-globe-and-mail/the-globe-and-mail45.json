It is especially inappropriate and insulting to our sovereignty to needlessly submit to social policies which the United States Congress has so far explicitly refused to accept.\u201dSignatories to the letter include Iowa Republican Steve King, who made headlines in Canada last month when he tweeted his support for the controversial Toronto mayoral campaign of alt-right anti-immigration champion Faith Goldy.The language in the agreement is relatively mild, pledging all three countries to support \u201cpolicies that protect workers against employment discrimination on the basis of sex, including with regard to pregnancy, sexual harassment, sexual orientation, gender identity,\u201d as well as caregiving responsibilities and child-rearing.Another offending clause calls for \u201cco-operative activities\u201d in the promotion of equality and ending job discrimination \u201cin the areas of age, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other characteristics not related to merit or the requirements of employment.\u201dBut the critics fear that in its current form, the agreement would make it impossible for Trump to roll back changes to non-discrimination policies that added sexual orientation and gender-identity language to existing federal laws when Barack Obama was president.A New York Times report last month cited an internal Department of Health and Human Services memo that proposes defining gender as an immutable biological condition determined by a person\u2019s sex organs at birth, triggering fear among gender-rights advocates that the Trump administration was planning to erode LGBTQ rights by making transgender Americans legally nonexistent.Friday\u2019s letter cited that policy direction \u2013 as well as an October 2017 Justice Department memo that essentially declared that U.S. civil-rights law doesn\u2019t ban sex-based workplace discrimination \u2013 as it warned that signing and ratifying USMCA would contradict the government\u2019s goals.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisement\u201cAt the same time your administration is carrying out a cohesive agenda regarding policies surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity, in the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services specifically, it is deeply troubling that the office of the U.S. Trade Representative has included contradictory language in the (USMCA),\u201d the letters tells Trump.The trade agreement, forged after 13 months of negotiations that laid bare tension in the Canada-U.S. relationship, is scheduled for what Canadian officials say will be a low-key, low-level signing when the three countries gather Nov. 30 for annual G20 meetings, taking place this year in Buenos Aires.The tensions have not eased, thanks largely to the fact that Canada and Mexico both remain subject to Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum exports. Officials in the Canadian Embassy in Washington have been trying to get those tariffs lifted.And a Reuters report Thursday said Canada has been pushing back against what it described as U.S. attempts to amend the text of the deal, something officials in Ottawa characterize as a routine vetting exercise.One Canadian source familiar with the ongoing effort said Friday that officials in Ottawa don\u2019t expect any substantive changes to the text before the signing.Trade watchers are also waiting nervously as the newly Democratic House of Representatives prepares to wield its power in opposition to the Trump legislative agenda. A number of prominent Democrats have signalled they won\u2019t vote to ratify the USMCA without more robust enforcement measures for the agreement\u2019s labour and environmental provisions.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
