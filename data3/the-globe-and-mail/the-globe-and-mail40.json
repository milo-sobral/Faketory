{"id": "Home from service, many veterans turn into entrepreneurs ", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Veteran Mike George has opened an artisanal import shop called Aurelius Food Co. on Ottawa\u2019s west side.Dave Chan/Dave ChanHe didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Mike George\u2019s post-military career started to come together one August afternoon in 2016, in a small village just north of Rome.Mr. George had spent most of the past decade \u201cgo-go-go,\u201d as he puts it, in a hectic military career that saw him on tours of duty in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Mali, Iraq and elsewhere. That summer afternoon in Italy, he was visiting his uncle, Jean, whose rural property contained an abundance of olive trees. The day before Mr. George was due to head back to Canada, his uncle asked whether there might be a market in Canada for the olive oil produced there.\u201cIt just went on like a light,\u201d Mr. George says. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to make this happen.\u2019 The next day I was on the plane, drafting scenarios and creating plans of attack. I had zero connections with the food world, so I just started sketching out scenarios and figuring out how to make those connections.\u201dStory continues below advertisementMr. George dove into the challenge with the intensity of a special forces soldier \u2013 which, of course, he was \u2013 and olive oil became his unlikely-sounding exit strategy from the Canadian Forces.\u201cI had to step away,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been doing this for 11 years; spent 900 days overseas, not including training. I was at a point in my life where I just wanted to be home a little more.\u201dHe finally put in his papers and was released from service in June. In September, he opened a brick-and-mortar shop called Aurelius Food Co. on Ottawa\u2019s west side, specializing in artisanal imports, including the olive oil he started out with.Mr. George\u2019s business may be unique, but his entrepreneurial path isn\u2019t.Canada doesn\u2019t track how many military veterans choose entrepreneurship. In the United States, veterans are 45 per cent more likely to own a business than non-veterans. In Canada, about 5,000 people exit the Forces every year, at an average age of 41 \u2013 young enough to have decades of working life ahead of them, but old enough to be disconnected from the civilian work force, and at a disadvantage in trying to break into existing professional networks. According to Veterans Affairs Canada, one-third of veterans report a difficult adjustment to civilian life.According to Kathleen Kilgour, program manager at Prince\u2019s Operation Entrepreneur (POE) \u2013 which provides mentoring, educational and financial assistance to veterans seeking to start a business \u2013 entrepreneurship is a common path on this side of the border, as well. The organization lists nearly 350 veteran-owned Canadian businesses on its website at buyveteran.ca.\u201cMilitary personnel have worked for years in careers where they\u2019ve had to exercise discipline, leadership, stay on mission, troubleshoot problems, mitigate risk,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many traits that are great for building a business.\u201dStory continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementThat is especially true, she believes, for the one-fifth of departing veterans who are medically released in any given year, for reasons ranging from physical injuries to PTSD and anxiety. Among POE\u2019s clients, 70 per cent were medically released. \u201cIt\u2019s a great fit because it\u2019s flexible,\u201d Ms. Kilgour says, \u201cand if they need to take time to manage their physical or mental health, they have the autonomy to do that.\u201dRegardless, she adds, entrepreneurship fills one of the veterans\u2019 most common needs: a new mission.That was certainly the case for Mr. George, who was still working at what he calls a \u201chigh operational tempo\u201d while planning his new business. He spent his days training, travelling and doing parachute exercises in California, and his nights arranging meet-and-greets with Ottawa chefs, and number-crunching expenses.One of the biggest impediments to post-military success, he believes, is veterans who don\u2019t understand how to translate their skills into the civilian world.\u201cI know a lot of guys who think they\u2019re only good at shooting guns and exploding things,\u201d Mr. George says. \u201cBut you\u2019re good at planning, you\u2019re good at scheduling, and time management.\u201dPaul B. Carrol spent 24 years in uniform as an infantry and special operations officer, before leaving the military in 2016. Today, he divides his time between a full-time job with the Bank of Nova Scotia, and an entrepreneurial gig as managing partner with Pathfinder Leadership Associates, a company founded in 2015 by Mr. Carroll\u2019s long-time \u201cfire-team partner,\u201d David Quick. Pathfinder provides military-style leadership training to corporate clients, including Air Canada, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., and others.Story continues below advertisement\u201cIf you\u2019ve spent decades being posted from job to job, you don\u2019t know how to do job interviews,\u201d he says.\u201cYou\u2019re used to a very rigid hierarchy, which is different from the civilian world,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut the money and time the taxpayer has invested in a soldier has produced a lot of skills, including leadership skills, that can be leveraged by the nation. To have those people just end up sitting in a townhouse in [Ontario towns] Oromocto or Petawawa is a waste to the nation.\u201dFor all of the strategic training inculcated in soldiers, Mr. Carroll says, many fail to strategize their own careers post-release. He suggests veterans develop a five-year plan before leaving. \u201cIf your network is only folks in uniform, you don\u2019t really have a network,\u201d he says.\u201cThe military is all \u2018we, we, we,\u2019 but in the private sector you\u2019ve got to be able to say \u2018I,\u2019 and not be afraid to sell yourself, which is something a lot of veterans struggle with.\u201dMr. George concurs.\u201cWhen people notice how much energy or discipline I put into it and my store, it\u2019s all a function of how I was in the military. But the important thing is that I take it for what it is \u2013 my time in the military was really important to me, but it doesn\u2019t define me. It\u2019s something I did, not who I am.\u201dWelcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community. This is a space where subscribers can engage with each other and Globe staff.
