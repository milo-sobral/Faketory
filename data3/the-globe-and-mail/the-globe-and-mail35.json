{"id": "Dragons\u2019 Den star raises $70-million for startup that finances e-commerce retailers", "paragraph": "The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.Partners Andrew D'Souza, left and Michele Romanow at the Clearbanc office in Toronto on Nov. 9, 2018.Christopher KatsarovMichele Romanow started to notice a pattern as she sat through pitch after pitch as a star of TV\u2019s Dragons' Den earlier this decade. While Ms. Romanow didn\u2019t want to invest in many of the e-commerce businesses appealing for her money, she did think she could provide them with capital in a more effective way by temporarily underwriting their online advertising in exchange for a cut of revenues.After doing about 10 such deals with her life partner, Andrew D\u2019Souza, the two successful serial entrepreneurs had a business idea of their own to pitch.On Monday, their three-year-old Toronto company, Clear Finance Technology Corp. (operating as Clearbanc) is set to announce it has raised US$70-million to offer a new financing alternative for young e-commerce businesses. Investors include a dozen U.S. and Canadian venture capital firms such as Emergence Capital Partners, 8VC, Social Capital, iNovia Capital and Power Corp. of Canada\u2019s Portag3 Ventures.Story continues below advertisementClearbanc fronts companies' online advertising on Google and Facebook in exchange for a small percentage of revenues \u2013 typically 5 per cent to 10 per cent \u2013 that spending generates until they are repaid, plus a 6-per-cent premium. It\u2019s relatively cheap financing and an opportunity that didn\u2019t exist until the huge recent shift in online advertising dollars to Silicon Valley\u2019s giant social-media platforms made it easier to measure returns on marketing dollars. \u201cMore than anything, Andrew and I built this by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs,\u201d Ms. Romanow said.Customers don\u2019t have to provide personal guarantees, give up equity or even submit to credit checks. They just have to provide Clearbanc access to business data from their online payment processors, Facebook and Google advertising accounts and their bank accounts.Clearbanc\u2019s software platform crunches that data and assesses their unit economics in minutes, spitting out an automated financing offer based on what the software determines is the customer\u2019s ability to repay. There is no fixed repayment schedule, maturity date, late penalties or collateral. As the revenue comes in to its customers, a small cut flows out daily to Clearbanc until it is repaid.\u201cA credit score is useful for personal underwriting but we should be looking at real business data to make these decisions,\u201d Ms. Romanow said. \u201cWe\u2019re using totally different data sources than have been traditionally used\u201d to assess credit-worthiness of small business.\u201cNo bank would ever say, \u2018we\u2019re going to give you a loan and please go spend it on marketing.\u2019 But we have a lot of confidence in digital channels; we deeply understand [e-commerce] customer acquisition models,\u201d Ms. Romanow said, thanks to her and Mr. D\u2019Souza\u2019s experience building and backing startups.Clearbanc chief executive Mr. D\u2019Souza added, \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot of time and money in building the integrations, testing the data, back-testing the underwriting. It\u2019s one of these businesses where if you don\u2019t do it right you can lose a lot of money very quickly.\u201d He predicted the company could keep default rates below 1 per cent and \u201can order of magnitude lower than the industry average.\u201dClearbanc has already done 500 such financings, underwriting between $5,000 to $10-million a deal. The company has financed $100-million to date \u2013 translating to millions of dollars in revenues for Clearbanc this year. While Clearbanc has funded much of its business from venture capital financing, it is now working to tap a range of capital sources to fund its underwriting activities including large banks and credit funds.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisement\u201cThe first time we looked at the metrics we didn\u2019t really believe it,\u201d said iNovia Capital\u2019s Toronto-based general partner Karamdeep Nijjar. \u201cThe nuance here is the capital turns very quickly. It\u2019s 6 per cent, but it goes out the door twice per year\u201d \u2013 meaning Clearbanc can effectively earn 12 per cent, well more than its cost of capital.\u201cIf it helps their customers grow faster, they get paid faster and that generates a higher return.\u201d Mr. Nijjar added that rather than aggressively grow revenues as some online lenders have done, \u201cinstead they\u2019re building a real, scalable business.\u201dWith e-commerce still representing a minority of retail spending and much advertising flowing through Facebook and Google, Clearbanc\u2019s founders estimate their total market could amount to tens of billions of dollars in financing annually.\u201cThe early numbers look quite good and the market is pretty large,\u201d 8VC general partner Alex Kolicich said.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
