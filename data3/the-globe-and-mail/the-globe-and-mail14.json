Neither category was considered in trouble 15 years ago. Now, scientists are recommending that the barren-ground caribou be listed as threatened, while the eastern migratory caribou \u2013 whose numbers have plummeted from more than one million to about 225,000 animals \u2013 qualify as endangered, the highest level of threat.canada\u2019s Caribou populationDesignat-able unitCurrentestimateHighestestimateBarren-Ground800,0002,000,000EasternMigratory225,0001,100,000NorthernMountain43,00048,000Boreal33,000N/ANfld.32,000100,000Dolphinand Union20,000100,00013,700Peary50,000TorngatMountains1,4005,000SouthernMountain1,4002,500CentralMountain5001,300Atlantic-Gasp\u00e9sie1301,500Note: Numbers collected 2014-2017THE GLOBE AND MAILSOURCE: CANADIAN GEOGRAPHICcanada\u2019s Caribou populationDesignatableunitCurrentestimateHighestestimateBarren-Ground800,0002,000,000EasternMigratory225,0001,100,000NorthernMountain48,00043,000Boreal33,000N/ANewfoundland32,000100,000Dolphinand Union20,000100,000Peary13,70050,000TorngatMountains1,4005,000SouthernMountain1,4002,500CentralMountain5001,300Atlantic-Gasp\u00e9sie1301,500Note: Numbers collected 2014-2017THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: CANADIAN GEOGRAPHICcanada\u2019s Caribou populationDesignatable unitCurrent estimateHighest est.800,000Barren-Ground2,000,000225,0001,100,000Eastern MigratoryNorthern Mountain48,00043,000Boreal33,000N/ANewfoundland32,000100,000Dolphin and Union20,000100,00013,700Peary50,000Torngat Mountains1,4005,000Southern Mountain1,4002,500500Central Mountain1,300Atlantic-Gasp\u00e9sie1301,500Note: Numbers collected 2014-2017THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: CANADIAN GEOGRAPHICDr. Ray, who is Canadian president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the dismal trend is echoed by continued declines among caribou in the Rocky Mountains and across the boreal forest that have long been understood to be at risk. Some caribou units are moving into higher threat levels faster than scientists can assess them.While the threats caribou face are complex and vary by region, the common denominator is human activity, primarily through resource development and, increasingly, climate change.Wherever they are found, caribou play the role of umbrella species, meaning their presence is of central importance to their ecosystems. In the North, they are also a food source for Indigenous communities.All caribou in Canada belong to one species. Scientists regard the 11 units as distinct because of a combination of their habitat, ecology and genetic differences. Some units contain only one herd; larger units have dozens.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementCARIBOU DISTRIBUTION ACROSS CANADACURRENT THREATSTATUS*DOLPHINAND UNION!!!Special concern!PEARYThreatened!!!!NORTHERNMOUNTAIN!Endangered!!!TORNGATMOUNTAINS!!!BARRENGROUND!!NFLD.!EASTERNMIGRATORY!!!CENTRALMOUNTAIN!!!!!!BOREAL!!!!!SOUTHERNMOUNTAINATLANTICGASPESIE*Based on assessments of 11 distinct population units ofcaribou for the Committee on the Status of EndangeredWildlife in CanadaCARRIE COCKBURN AND MURAT Y\u00dcKSELIR/THE GLOBEAND MAIL, SOURCE: CHRIS BRACKLEY/CANADIANGEOGRAPHICCARIBOU DISTRIBUTION ACROSS CANADACURRENT THREATSTATUS*DOLPHINAND UNION!!!Special concern!PEARYThreatened!!!!NORTHERNMOUNTAIN!Endangered!!!TORNGATMOUNTAINS!!!BARRENGROUND!!NFLD.!EASTERNMIGRATORY!!!CENTRALMOUNTAIN!!!!!!BOREAL!!!!!SOUTHERNMOUNTAINATLANTICGASPESIE*Based on assessments of 11 distinct population units of cariboufor the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in CanadaCARRIE COCKBURN AND MURAT Y\u00dcKSELIR/THE GLOBE AND MAILSOURCE: CHRIS BRACKLEY/CANADIAN GEOGRAPHICCARIBOU DISTRIBUTION ACROSS CANADACURRENT THREAT STATUS*!!!DOLPHINAND UNION!Special concernPEARY!!Threatened!!!!!EndangeredNORTHERNMOUNTAIN!!!!TORNGATMOUNTAINSBARRENGROUND!!!NFLD.EASTERNMIGRATORY!!!CENTRALMOUNTAIN!!!!!!BOREAL!!!!!SOUTHERNMOUNTAINATLANTICGASPESIE*Based on assessments of 11 distinct population units of caribou for theCommittee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in CanadaCARRIE COCKBURN AND MURAT Y\u00dcKSELIR/THE GLOBE AND MAILSOURCE: CHRIS BRACKLEY/CANADIAN GEOGRAPHICThe vast geographic range of caribou presents a challenge for scientists trying to understand how the species is doing. That task is compounded by the fact that caribou populations are in constant flux, which makes it difficult to separate normal variations from a sustained downturn.Yet, even in the far north, the emerging prognosis for the caribou is no longer in doubt. Unless definitive action is taken, scientists say, caribou could be heading to a point of no return, even if they linger for generations.\u201cWe know there are natural cycles with their numbers, but all the herds except for a few seem to be approaching population minimums and we\u2019re not seeing those signs of recovery that you normally would see,\u201d said Brandon Laforest, an Iqaluit-based specialist in Arctic species and ecosystems with the environmental group WWF Canada.The caribou are among the most visible of the approximately 16,700 species that have suffered an average 60-per-cent decline since 1970, according to a new WWF report released on Monday.Experts say a big part of the problem in Canada has been government reluctance to come to grips with the plight of the caribou at a scale that goes beyond single resource projects and their local impact on individual herds.For example, last December, WWF Canada wrote to the Trudeau government, which opposes U.S. development on the Alaskan calving grounds of the Porcupine River caribou herd, which is part of the barren-ground unit, to ask why it has not moved to prevent mining projects on calving ground in Nunavut. The government has yet to respond.Story continues below advertisementConservation groups say the heel-dragging illustrates the inadequacies of Canada\u2019s legal framework for species protection in the face of resistance from provincial governments and industry.Last year, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society launched a lawsuit against federal environment minister Catherine McKenna for what it says is a failure by the government to uphold its responsibilities to protect boreal caribou.In April, the federal government issued a report that said the provinces were failing to develop and implement boreal caribou protection plans as required, but Ottawa has so far not taken stronger action.\u201cCanada\u2019s caribou populations need our help, and the Government of Canada is working closely with the provinces and territories \u2013 who have primary responsibility \u2013 to better protect them,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said.Boreal, or woodland, caribou are a threatened species in Canada\u2019s boreal forests, due in large part to disruptions in their habitat by the forestry industry and roads.VAL\u00c9RIE COURTOIS/CANADIAN BOREAL INITIATIVEOutside of Canada, the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in Washington, is calling on Ottawa to employ a \u201csafety net order\u201d that would supersede provincial authority to protect boreal caribou habitat.From a global perspective, the action would be doubly effective, said Courtenay Lewis, a policy manager for the organization, because it would protect forests whose destruction would contribute significantly to climate change.Story continues below advertisement\u201cSome of the largest carbon stores in the boreal directly overlap with some of the last remaining boreal caribou habitat,\u201d she said.Dr. Ray said she plans to lay out her insights on Wednesday at the Ottawa meeting after having worked on six reports between 2009 and 2017 that detail the condition of every caribou unit in Canada.While her conclusions will not surprise experts, she said, her assessment work, based on the collective efforts of scores of scientists, has given her a rare vantage point on the species. In conjunction with her presentation, she has also worked with mapmakers at Canadian Geographic to show how the caribou units are distributed across the country and their worsening threat levels.But what is crucial, she said, is that the information translate into action.\u201cIt\u2019s time to move in a real way towards protection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to change the paradigm.\u201d    Gwich'in people in the Yukon have depended on caribou for food for thousands of years.
