It hosts dance lessons, Wednesday night chess, even stamp-collector meetings. The city\u2019s emergency response workers \u2013 paramedics, firefighters and local RCMP \u2013 used to have their own standing reservation in a separate section. But they stopped coming in soon after federal tax auditors made a bombshell allegation.The Canada Revenue Agency began poring through the MGM\u2019s books in 2006 and became convinced that owner-operators Tony and Helen Samaroo were tax cheats of the highest order. The agency accused them of skimming $1.7-million over a two-year period, resulting in 21 criminal tax-evasion charges in 2008. The Samaroos faced serious prison time and financial ruin.Many individual taxpayers, accountants, tax lawyers and former CRA employees describe the agency\u2019s approach as having become overly adversarial, straining its relationships with taxpayers.Chris Wattie/REUTERSAs a B.C. Supreme Court judge would later find, CRA investigators never seriously considered the possibility the Samaroos might be innocent. After the story made the front page of the local newspaper, one auditor said in an e-mail to colleagues, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to read the edition after the guilty verdict.\u201d Even when it became clear the CRA didn\u2019t have a case, the agency\u2019s lead investigator on the file manufactured incriminating evidence, while concealing evidence that might have helped clear the restaurant owners, according to the judge\u2019s ruling. The CRA set out to make the facts of the case fit, the judge said.Story continues below advertisementIt did not succeed. In 2011, the Samaroos were acquitted in a criminal trial that exposed serious flaws in the CRA investigation.Not that it meant an end to their saga. \u201cOver the past 12 years we have not had a single day in which we have been free of the fear of destruction by the CRA,\u201d the Samaroos said in an e-mail.In fact, many individual taxpayers, accountants, tax lawyers and former CRA employees describe the agency\u2019s approach as having become overly adversarial, straining its relationships with taxpayers \u2013 particularly small businesses.Now facing a level of public, political and legal scrutiny the agency is unaccustomed to \u2013 including scathing reviews from the Auditor-General, who is scheduled to release a report on the CRA\u2019s audit activities on Nov. 20 \u2013 the CRA is in the midst of a Trudeau government effort to soften its image and instill a \u201cculture of service.\u201dIt has a long way to go, its critics say.\u201cThe Prime Minister has said that the CRA is to treat taxpayers like clients, but instead they treat them with contempt, they treat them abusively and predatorily,\u201d said Steven Kelliher, a Victoria-based lawyer who has represented the Samaroos for more than a decade, as well as other clients who have found themselves in the taxman\u2019s crosshairs. \u201cWhen we sit down to fill out our tax form, we are afraid of them \u2013 and that\u2019s what they want.\u201dThe CRA interacts with virtually every business and individual in the country, making it a main point of contact between Canadians and the federal government. For the most part, it\u2019s a civil exchange: By global standards, Canada is a country of honest taxpayers, with some of the world\u2019s highest tax compliance rates \u2013 about 93 per cent, according to the CRA.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementBut offshore tax evasion has assumed a high public profile recently, sparked by the revelations in the Panama Papers, which included dozens of Canadian names on a list of wealthy people hiding money in foreign tax havens. The CRA\u2019s subsequent efforts to crack down on evasion and abusive tax avoidance \u201cidentified\u201d $2.9-billion in \u201cfiscal impact\u201d last year. But PEI Senator Percy Downe, a frequent critic of the agency, said the CRA is proving less effective at actually collecting money from those sources. \u201cSo they overcompensate on domestic tax evasion,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tough talk they use about overseas tax evasion is a reality domestically.\u201dWhich is one of the reasons why, in much of the tax profession, the CRA has developed a reputation for treating small-business owners with a presumption of guilt. Once the agency\u2019s systems flag a potential tax evader, it can be hard to disabuse investigators of their suspicions.\u201cWe hear it from taxpayers and we see it as professionals,\u201d said Fred O\u2019Riordan, a former CRA assistant commissioner who is now the national leader for tax policy with Ernst & Young LLP. \u201cThere are audits that are not well founded, and it\u2019s very difficult to move the agency off its positions.\u201dDoing so often requires onerous amounts of time and money, which raises concerns about a two-track tax system \u2013 one for those with the means to hide from and fight the CRA and one for those who do not. \u201cIf you\u2019re an average Canadian and you get a call that the CRA wants to visit you, you should be shaking in your boots,\u201d Mr. Downe said.Any blame for the current state of the CRA, according to the government, belongs to its predecessors. \u201cAfter 10 years of fear-mongering and aggressive communication with taxpayers under the Harper Conservatives, our government has been working hard to take a client-focused approach,\u201d Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier said in a written statement. \u201cHowever, I recognize that this will take some time and that there is still work to be done.\u201dAnd yet, since the Liberals came to power, most new CRA funding has not gone to client services, employee training or dispute resolution but to auditing and enforcement. And the government expects a big return on that investment, putting pressure on investigators, auditors and collectors to hunt for hidden income and boost tax revenues.Story continues below advertisementIn the three budgets tabled so far by the Trudeau government, roughly $1.5-billion in new funding has been allocated to the CRA over a five-year period. About two-thirds of that money has been earmarked for enforcement activities meant to crack down on tax evasion and to fight sophisticated tax avoidance. \u201cThe pointy end of the stick gets all the attention and all the additional resources,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Riordan said.As the federal budget papers make explicit, for every new dollar of funding dedicated to auditing, the government expects a return of about $5 in tax revenues. That kind of expectation to deliver financially filters through the ranks of the CRA\u2019s audit division. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an auditor who has a huge assessment, that\u2019s viewed as a thumbs-up in the audit area,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Riordan said.Having that huge assessment stand up on appeal is a different matter. A 2016 Auditor-General report found that 65 per cent of tax objections reviewed by the CRA over a five-year period were settled fully or in part in favour of the taxpayer. The CRA has since seen little improvement on that front, with 63 per cent of assessments being reversed at the appeals level in the fiscal year ended last March.\u201cThat means that all those taxpayers were put through this grief for nothing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Riordan said. And it suggests a quality-control problem in CRA investigations.The outcomes of tax objectionsTaxpayers filed more than 220,000 objectionsover a five-year period ending March 31, 2016.Nearly 175,000 went to review, resulting infavourable decisions for taxpayers in about 65per cent of cases.No change toassessment:34.8%Objection allowedin full: 42.3%Objection allowedin part: 22.3%Increase in incometax owed: 0.6%MATT LUNDY, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: AUDITOR-GENERALThe outcomes of tax objectionsTaxpayers filed more than 220,000 objections over a five-year period ending March 31, 2016.

That analysis suggested the Samaroos misappropriated $1.7-million. But the auditor made a basic accounting mistake that could have accounted for almost $1-million. Inheritances of almost $400,000 were also missed.\u201cA net-worth audit is an increasingly popular tool for the CRA. But it\u2019s a very blunt tool \u2013 and it\u2019s often flawed,\u201d said Toronto tax lawyer David Rotfleisch. \u201cA lot of auditors are just ticking off boxes and coming up with numbers that make no sense.\u201dStory continues below advertisementWhether taxpayer grievances and negative experiences add up to a systemic problem at the CRA is a matter of opinion. Mr. O\u2019Riordan said that in his experience at, and with, the CRA, \u201c99 per cent of the people are very professional and trying to do the best job possible.\u201d But many dealing with auditors and collectors on a daily basis speak of a deterioration of service and an unfamiliarity with the tax code. \u201cThe CRA doesn\u2019t give enough resources to their auditors. Tax evolves very quickly, and there are a lot of very difficult concepts. I find that sometimes auditors are left to figure it out on their own,\u201d said James Rhodes, a Kitchener, Ont., lawyer specializing in tax disputes.Once auditors make their assessments, they are often taken off the file. Mistakes may never make their way back to the original auditor, even if the appeals division fully reverses the decision. \u201cTo me that\u2019s the greatest fault with the system. I feel that there is no disincentive to doing a bad job,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. To that end, however, the CRA says it is making progress, having launched the \u201cfeedback loop\u201d process, which is meant to improve communication between the agency\u2019s various entities.But the sheer amount of time it takes the CRA to resolve disputes, particularly complex ones, undermines the idea of timely feedback. Auditor-General Michael Ferguson\u2019s 2016 report also found that the average high-complexity income-tax objection took almost 2\u00bd years to settle. \u201cThat type of performance just isn\u2019t acceptable, and the government departments need to find a way to design their services so that they actually meet the needs of the citizens,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said at the time. The CRA said it has brought down processing times, though they remain well in excess of those of other countries with similar tax systems. The most complex disputes, for example, currently take an average of 690 days \u2013 almost two years \u2013 to resolve.In other branches of the agency, service standards have also been found to be dismal. A subsequent Auditor-General report last November found that CRA call centres blocked more than half of the 53.5 million calls received between March, 2016, and March, 2017, so the agency could meet its standards for call wait times. Additionally, call-centre agents gave bad advice to taxpayers almost a third of the time. In response, the CRA said it has hired more agents and improved its training.Liz Temple had a reputation for being one of the \u201csofter\u201d collections officers. In 24 years at the CRA, she spent much of her time visiting people who owed taxes, assessing their ability to pay and figuring out a plan to settle their debts. \u201cI didn\u2019t go for the jugular right away. I gave them a chance,\u201d Ms. Temple said. Her accounts often consisted of very small business owners who lacked basic accounting controls. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do it on their own. They need bookkeeping, but they just can\u2019t afford it.\u201dLiz Temple spent 25 years as a collections officers/auditor at the CRA. She left in 2014, unhappy with the CRA\u2019s increasingly aggressive approach. She now acts on behalf of small businesses in Kitchener who find themselves facing big tax assessments.Ian WillmsOver the years, the softer approach lost favour with her superiors, Ms. Temple said. The process resorted more quickly to legal options such as garnishment and seizure of assets. She said she felt a culture shift to a stricter posture. There was less consideration for honest mistakes, reasonable explanations for anomalies or for a person\u2019s ability to pay. By the time she retired in 2014, Ms. Temple said the CRA\u2019s prevailing attitude toward anyone who owed taxes had hardened: \u201cYou\u2019re stealing from the government.\"It took Luc Dubois six years to convince the CRA he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. He owned and operated a group of Quebec summer day camps as well as a large residential camp in the Laurentians. In 2010, an audit claimed Mr. Dubois and his company had underreported income for the four years prior by more than $1-million. He faced a bill of $750,000 in taxes, penalties and interest. When he met at his accountant\u2019s office with the CRA auditor, Mr. Dubois\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHe had already made up his mind. He was not interested in understanding our business at all,\u201d Mr. Dubois said. \u201cI realized I was in big trouble.\u201dHe committed himself almost full time to challenging the CRA\u2019s claims, while simultaneously preparing for bankruptcy should he lose his case. \u201cWe were almost killed by this,\u201d he said.In 2010, the CRA claimed Luc Dubois failed to report $1.4-million in revenue, making for a $750,000 bill with taxes and penalties. For six years he fought, eventually getting the CRA to admit he owed nothing. Roger LemoyneFinally, after dealing with six different investigators and managers and six reassessments over six years, Mr. Dubois wrestled his CRA tax bill down to about $6,000. He didn\u2019t even want to pay that on principle. \u201cBut I had to stop the bleeding.\u201d He had spent almost $100,000 in accounting and legal fees. He sold the company and vowed to never go into business in Canada again.The CRA said privacy rules prevent it from discussing Mr. Dubois\u2019s file. But his lawyer confirmed the facts of the tax dispute. \u201cIt never should have happened in the first place,\u201d said Alain M\u00e9nard, a partner at Cain Lamarre LLP in Montreal. \u201cYou can see it at work, this must-win-at-all-costs attitude.\u201dThis was not always the way of the CRA, said Mr. Rhodes, the Kitchener lawyer. In his early years in the business, the point of an audit was to arrive at the right answer. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Your client didn\u2019t claim enough for their work space and home, but here are some other expenses we just can\u2019t accept.' It was a corrective thing. \u2026 These days, auditors will never mention anything that\u2019s in your client\u2019s favour.\u201dThe agency is not oblivious to the complaints. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no doubt that collection or audit situations can be tense, the CRA has heard the message that this is an area for improvement and is working with small business representatives on the issue,\u201d CRA spokesman Dany Morin said in an e-mail.For much of its history, the CRA was left to its own devices as it went about the business of filling the national coffers. When Mr. Downe served as prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s chief of staff, he sat in on every cabinet meeting for two years. \u201cThere were never any hard questions asked about just what kind of job they were doing. I don\u2019t think the CRA was ever mentioned,\u201d Mr. Downe said.Hard questions are being asked now. In addition to the Auditor-General\u2019s attention, recent court decisions have opened the agency up to a new level of legal exposure. Once virtually immune to civil claims, the CRA was found by the B.C. Supreme Court in 2014 to owe a \u201cduty of care\u201d to taxpayers \u2013 an obligation the CRA strenuously resisted. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous concept \u2013 though they have so much power and control over people, they\u2019re not going to accept any responsibility in how they wield it,\u201d said Laurie Armstrong, a retired lawyer who represented the plaintiff in the suit.In August, a ruling in Quebec Superior Court found the CRA negligent in conducting an offshore tax audit. \u201cTaxpayers, the courts, and the CRA will now be alive that there\u2019s a movement of the times towards negligence awards against the CRA,\u201d said John Grant, a tax litigator at national law firm Miller Thomson LLP. \u201cThere should be a chilling effect on CRA\u2019s management.\"For the Samaroos, the struggle did not end with their acquittal.Last March, they won a lawsuit against the CRA in a groundbreaking finding of malicious prosecution. In ordering the CRA to pay the Samaroos $1.7-million in damages and legal fees, Justice Robert Punnett said the prosecution of the family \u201cviolated fundamental rights and was highly reprehensible.\u201d And he suggested the issues exposed by the trial and civil suit that followed may in fact extend to the core of the CRA \u2013 that it is potentially permeated by an \u201cunfortunate culture.\u201dThe CRA is appealing the decision.Welcome to The Globe and Mail\u2019s comment community.
