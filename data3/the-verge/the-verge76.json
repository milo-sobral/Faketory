{"id": "Spinal implants help treat paralysis but aren\u2019t ready for primetime", "paragraph": "David Mzee\u2019s left leg has been paralyzed ever since he bounced off a trampoline and broke his neck in 2010. So when he woke up in the middle of the night last year and realized he was moving his left toe, he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was real,\u201d he says. He kept wiggling the toe, resting it, and then wiggling it again. \u201cI think I was awake for an hour after that, just to see if it keeps on moving.\u201dIt kept moving. Mzee\u2019s toe wiggle was the result of months of physical training and a device that delivers pulses of electrical stimulation to Mzee\u2019s spinal cord. Now, after participating in a study at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL), he and Gert-Jan Oskam, another man with partial lower body paralysis, can walk across the ground with crutches. A third participant, Sebastian Tobler, came to the study with an extreme case of lower body paralysis \u2014 and by the end, he could walk across the ground with a walker, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. For all of the study participants, stepping is still slow and difficult; they continue to use wheelchairs to get around (and, for Mzee, to play competitive wheelchair rugby.) But the surprising thing is that even with the spinal stimulation turned off, both Mzee and Oskam can now take a handful of steps with crutches, and move joints that they couldn\u2019t move before \u2014 like Mzee\u2019s left toe. It shows that with electrical stimulation and training, the spinal cord can regain control over paralyzed muscles even years after an injury. The study, led by Gr\u00e9goire Courtine, an associate professor at EPFL, is the third small study in just over a month to show similar results. And it raises the question of whether it\u2019s time for these spinal stimulation devices to move beyond the lab and into the clinic. \u201cIf we rush too fast, there\u2019s going to be mistakes and that could set back everything,\u201d says Reggie Edgerton, a professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Edgerton, who was a co-author on one of the three recent studies, encourages caution, tempered by the urgency felt by many in the medical community: \u201cAt the same time I know that patients are waiting, and keep waiting.\u201d Each year, traumatic incidents around the world injure hundreds of thousands of people\u2019s spinal cords, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, 1.3 million people have paralysis due to spinal cord injuries. For people living with such injuries, these studies may offer hope that being able to move once-paralyzed muscles even a little bit could bring massive benefits like more independence, better blood pressure control, and boosted stamina. But for now, there\u2019s no real treatment. \u201cOutside of these experimental trials, there\u2019s not really anything else available that even claims to offer long term benefit,\u201d says Jeff Marquis, whose lower body has been completely paralyzed ever since a mountain biking accident.Like Mzee, Marquis received a spinal cord implant as part of a research study. The implant and training at the University of Louisville in Kentucky helped Marquis and another participant with complete lower body paralysis, Kelly Thomas, walk across the ground with walkers. \u201cI used to not get out of bed without someone there to help me transfer. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t even think about doing now,\u201d Marquis says. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s benefited me.\u201d Thomas has made so much progress with walking that she\u2019s now working on getting rid of the walker altogether \u2014 but other strength gains have made a major difference for her, too. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to contract all my torso muscles prior to having this implant, and now if I need to cough, or need to clear my throat, I can,\u201d she says. \u201cIt puts my mind at ease.\u201d Yet another person with complete lower body paralysis who participated in a study at the Mayo Clinic can now take steps across the ground with assistance, according to a second paper published last month. The track record isn\u2019t perfect: there were two participants in the Louisville study whose gains weren\u2019t quite as dramatic as those of Thomas and Marquis, and another person in the Mayo clinic study whose results haven\u2019t been published yet. None have returned to their pre-injury health. Still, three studies in three different centers have shown positive results \u2014 using somewhat different approaches. Courtine\u2019s team in Switzerland took the tech itself the farthest: they MacGyvered a device intended for deep brain stimulation, the Medtronic Activa RC, to send timed pulses of electricity into the spinal cords of Mzee, Oskam, and Tobler.  \u201cWe scienced the shit out of it,\u201d says Courtine, whose team at EPFL collaborated with neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch and others at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) on the research. \u201cThe way we stimulate the spinal cord is with the precision of a Swiss watch \u2014 where we stimulate, when we stimulate.\u201d The theory is that this pulsed stimulation resembles signals from the brain, and the precise timing \u2014 matched to the study participants\u2019 steps \u2014 might help rewire the injured nervous system. \u201cIn the central nervous system, plasticity is related to time. When neurons fire together they breed new connections,\u201d Courtine says. Right now, it\u2019s still a theory \u2014 supported by the group\u2019s work in animal models. But the Louisville and Mayo Clinic studies also showed positive results using a simpler strategy that sends continuous, rather than pulsed, electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. Both approaches are helping people move parts of their bodies that they couldn\u2019t before. Still, despite the successes, there\u2019s a long way to go before either method is made available to patients at a broader scale. The first step is improving the technology, Courtine says. \u201cClearly we have reached the limit for what we can do as academic investigators,\u201d he says. To that end, the team has spun out a startup called GTX medical to continue their work with the stimulation tech: the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) owns the patents, and is exclusively licensing them to GTX medical.The goal is to continue optimizing the electrode array and the neurostimulator, as well as the voice-activated user interface. \u201cIt needs to be incredibly reliable,\u201d Courtine says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just use Siri.\u201d For example, imagine if someone talking next to you could turn on or off your stimulation, he says. But those investments in research and development, followed by clinical trials, aren\u2019t cheap. That\u2019s one reason that Courtine\u2019s startup isn\u2019t facing a crowd of competitors. In the traditional regulatory pathway for medical devices, companies invest upwards of $100 million for large-scale, long-term clinical trials to show the device is safe and effective. \u201cOn average, to go from absolute startup to approval is in the eight-to-ten year range,\u201d Donald Palme, a strategic scientist for NAMSA, a medical research organization says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, and that\u2019s the major barrier: the potential for profit, for most of these companies.\u201dAnd conducting clinical trials in the spinal cord injury population can be challenging: \u201cEvery injury is different, every extent of the injury is different. It\u2019s going to work in some, and it\u2019s not going to work in others,\u201d Palme says. He suspects that the big names in electrical stimulation like Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and Abbott are following these academic research studies closely. But the one with the closest ties to the tech, Medtronic, has little to say about their future plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to learn related to what type of product this indication really needs and the clinical pathway associated with getting this therapy to market,\u201d Sara Thatcher, a spokesperson for the company, says in an email. Even if an implant does make it to large-scale clinical trials, there\u2019s still another group of people who will have to buy into the technology, Mzee, Thomas, and Marquis agree: the people it\u2019s intended for. And using it takes a serious commitment, they all say. There\u2019s surgery, the time investment for the physical training, and there are no guarantees that it will work for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not a magic pill that makes you walk,\u201d Mzee says. \u201cYou need to train hard.\u201dIn addition to the physical work, the cycle of hope and disappointment as abilities look like they might re-appear and then never materialize can take a toll, too, he says. For Mzee, it\u2019s been worth it. Having more control over his once-paralyzed left leg means he can flip over in bed, and get comfortable enough to sleep, for one thing. \u201cBut people should know that sometimes it\u2019s a roller coaster of feelings and that the training can be very hard.\u201d Mzee says. \u201cAnd we still don\u2019t know the long-term effects, whether good nor bad.\u201dUpdate November 3rd, 2018: Updated to include the study contributions of researchers at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).
