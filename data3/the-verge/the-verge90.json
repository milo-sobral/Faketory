{"id": "The internet\u2019s horrified with Detective Pikachu", "paragraph": "To understand the intense reaction to Detective Pikachu\u2019s first trailer, you have to understand where the Pok\u00e9mon fandom stands in 2018. As a franchise, Pok\u00e9mon taps into a yearning for adventure: it\u2019s just you, your pet pals, and the open road. Defeat the gyms and you\u2019ll get actual emblems for your success. No parents, no responsibilities. The possibilities seem endless. For a while, that fantasy is enough for Pok\u00e9mon fans \u2014 and then they grow up.For years now, there\u2019s been a growing shift within the Pok\u00e9mon fandom, as the franchise continues to cater to children even as its original audience ages. The kids who sneaked Game Boys under their desk in the \u201890s now have wrinkles and mortgages, but the games themselves have been preserved in amber. Ash Ketchum will never truly age. Obviously, companies behind these decisions know what they\u2019re doing: Pok\u00e9mon is still extremely successful, especially after the advent of Pok\u00e9mon Go. But Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s refusal to mature means that part of the fandom has grown obsessed with what darker pocket monsters could look like. That pitch \u2014 Pok\u00e9mon, but realistic, more adult, is everywhere.Fan art with savage, grittier renditions of pok\u00e9mon regularly goes viral on the internet, accruing millions of page views and hits. Pok\u00e9mon fan games that blow up on the internet often promise storylines where protagonists are older, or are in more complicated situations than simply having the desire to catch them all. And whenever a new game in the core franchise gets released, weary fans always ask: is this one actually going to go somewhere different?Hardcore old-school fans want nothing more than for Pok\u00e9mon to evolve as a franchise. This, then, might explain why we\u2019ve suddenly been saddled with the terror that is Detective Pikachu, a live-action movie where our favorite yellow rodent speaks actual words. Right now, everyone is fixating on how strange every creature in this trailer looks, especially when it comes to the textures. Something looks off when you add actual fur or realistic skin to iconic monsters, no?And yet! Something about all of this looks incredibly familiar to anyone who has ever seen \u201crealistic pok\u00e9mon\u201d fan art. Isn\u2019t this the style that\u2019s gone viral a thousand times over on the internet? Isn\u2019t the idea that pok\u00e9mon can be out in the real world exactly what made Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s trailer blow up? Haven\u2019t fans always wondered what pok\u00e9mon might say if we could actually speak to them? This is exactly what people asked for!Well, technically. Yes, people want \u2018realistic\u2019 pok\u00e9mon. Yes, they want a Pok\u00e9mon game that feels modern and self-aware, they want to know what it might feel like to have the games be less of a fantasy and more of a reality. But... not like this. Detective Pikachu feels like someone took a very specific list, checked off every item, and then went to a dollar store to fulfill the order with off-brand merchandise. The fact this looks like fan art and not official renditions says everything, and explains why the internet can\u2019t stop talking about this trailer. But hey, at least the jokes are good. pic.twitter.com/r19LHO99RKMister Pikachu. pic.twitter.com/zoHoNTi5ebpic.twitter.com/15hCt7o4Vkseth everman pic.twitter.com/0rhh26o4DKthis one frame got me i pic.twitter.com/u7zvyG5Xodpic.twitter.com/BjoJoiL1QkThat one person who never quite stopped looking like a weird baby. pic.twitter.com/26IM7FWQ1ZDetective Pikachu looks great pic.twitter.com/rG0IjmDt0uCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
