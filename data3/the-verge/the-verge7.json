{"id": "Android\u2019s new multitasking is terrible and should be changed back", "paragraph": "I\u2019ve been using the Google Pixel 3 XL since its launch two weeks ago, and I wholeheartedly agree with our review\u2019s conclusion that the Pixel 3 offers the best Android experience right now. But there\u2019s one aspect of that Android experience that I can\u2019t abide, and no, it\u2019s not the gargantuan notch. It\u2019s the appallingly bad new multitasking system, which is mandatory on this year\u2019s Pixel generation, foregoing the option of the old familiar Android button trio as we had with the Pixel 2 on the same Android 9 Pie OS.On its surface, Google\u2019s new approach to switching between apps looks a whole lot like the one Apple introduced with the iPhone X. It relies on swipes and shares two of the same fundamental gestures: one swipe up from the bottom of the screen brings up the multitasking overview, while lateral swipes across the bottom navigation bar flip between apps. Like my colleague Dan Seifert, who argues everyone should copy the iPhone X\u2019s gestures, I think Apple\u2019s implementation of this approach is gorgeous (in its animations) and quickly becomes second nature once you figure out the basics. Google\u2019s, on the other hand, is filled with internal contradictions and painful annoyances.Google\u2019s first major sin with implementing these new gestures in the Android interface is that the company refused to get rid of a fundamental old one. The app drawer, the place where you stash all the apps you don\u2019t need on your home screen, has for a long time been accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. (At least in Google\u2019s flavor of Android.) Now, that same swipe is how you get into multitasking mode, which is all well and good \u2014 I don\u2019t fear change \u2014 but Google thought it wise to still have an upward swipe to access the app drawer, just a much longer and horribly unnatural one. With a phone the size of the Pixel 3 XL, it\u2019s legit thumb tendon exercise to execute a full-screen swipe.When I want to access my apps, what tends to happen most often is I fail at completing the awkward long swipe, wind up at the multitasking menu, and then I do another quick swipe to get to the apps. This may sound minor, but it genuinely takes away from the speed with which I\u2019m able to access my less commonly used apps. Even if I populated a half dozen home screens or folders with those apps, that\u2019d still take longer than Google\u2019s previous, effortless system of swiping up and picking out the desired app immediately. Where there was once fluidity and speed, Google has now introduced frustration.The slickest aspect of Apple\u2019s iPhone X / XS navigation is the way you can swipe across the gesture bar at the bottom to switch between apps. Google has a drunk version of this. Firstly, it lacks the smooth animation of Apple\u2019s system. In Android Pie, the app window shrinks back, slides right, and then the previously used app zooms into full view. This animation is jarring, with the latter app seeming to bounce up at you.Apple\u2019s navigation also allows the user to swipe left and right between apps, whereas Google\u2019s only toggles between the most recently used app and the current one. To go further back, you don\u2019t do more swipes, you have to hold your finger on the right of a navigation bar that shows up and functions somewhat like a scroll bar in desktop operating systems. The problem there is that I can never judge the correct amount of holding to do to get to my desired app. With the iPhone, I know that the fifth most recently used app is five swipes away, I can do that without looking at or paying attention to the phone. With the Pixel 3, I have to very carefully pick the exact right moment to let go as the phone flicks between my recently used apps. It feels like trying to walk on an ice rink.Set aside the comparisons to Apple\u2019s gesture-based interface, which is still not everyone\u2019s favorite cup of UI tea. What about Google\u2019s existing multitasking system in previous Android iterations? It had a dedicated software button to access multitasking, so no swiping conflict with the app drawer, and I could double-tap that button to switch to my most recently used app. It was fast \u2014 but more to the point, that action was easy to turn into an unconscious habit. There\u2019s nothing easy or natural about Google\u2019s new system.Another undesired change in Google\u2019s latest multitasking view is that you basically only see your current app in it, with only vertical slivers of the two neighboring apps. In previous versions of Android, you\u2019d get a vertical stack of apps, letting you tap to access older apps more quickly. Samsung still does this, and when I pick up the Galaxy Note 9 with Android 8.1, I feel like I\u2019ve had an interface upgrade when switching apps.In summary, Google has reduced the usability and information density of its multitasking without gaining much of anything. Even if you believe, as Google does, that the trio of Android software buttons needed to go away to simplify the experience and allow more space on the screen for other uses, that hasn\u2019t really happened with the iteration introduced in Android 9 Pie. There\u2019s still just as much space occupied on the screen by the back and home button as there used to be with the previous three buttons.I don\u2019t think Google\u2019s new multitasking system is an irredeemable disaster, but neither do I think it\u2019s worthy of being the default and only option for the company\u2019s signature version of Android on the Pixel 3. Just give us the old option back, Google, while you iron out the kinks in your new one.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
