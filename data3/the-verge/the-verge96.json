{"id": "Detective Pikachu trailer proves pok\u00e9mon shouldn\u2019t be realistic", "paragraph": "The first live-action Pok\u00e9mon movie is coming next year, whether you want it or not. Legendary Pictures and The Pok\u00e9mon Company released the first trailer for Detective Pikachu, starring Ryan Reynolds as a very furry version of the franchise\u2019s best-known character.Detective Pikachu follows a young man named Tim (Justice Smith), whose father has gone mysteriously missing. Tim pairs up with Pikachu, his dad\u2019s former partner, who also... talks. The movie was inspired by the game of the same name, which also features a gruff, talking Pikachu. But enough about the plot! We need to talk about the hyper-realistic style the films\u2019 creators have taken here. Every pok\u00e9mon from my childhood is now a textured nightmare, from Jigglypuff\u2019s fur (I guess I always pictured it as more balloon-like) to whatever is going on with Charizard. Pikachu seems to have gone the way of Winnie the Pooh in Christopher Robin. Psyduck is a nightmare. We also get to share these from the early sneak peek into #DetectivePikachu... they look pretty good, right? pic.twitter.com/Sflk6SBK6oThis will be the last thing I see before I die. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
