{"id": "The latest bizarre Simpsons meme is about downloading songs on Limewire ", "paragraph": "The glory days of The Simpsons, which recently began its 30th season, have been over for multiple decades. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the show from inspiring some viral memes in recent years that wrap its mid-90s humor in the contemporary, often bizarre visual language of modern internet humor. While the most famous remains the endless iterations on the now-famous 1996 \u201dSteamed Hams\u201d dinner scene, the latest Simpsons meme might be the strangest yet. It revolves around two very retro concepts: The Simpsons (back when it was good), and using the now-defunct, mid-aughts peer-to-peer filesharing service Limewire. In this spirit of many of the best memes, the Simpsons / Limewire combo is not only non-sequitur but oddly specific, focusing on the malware-inflected files that often posed as MP3s on the service, particularly those claiming to be the song \u201cNumb\u201d by Linkin Park.These Limewire memes are excellent pic.twitter.com/CtAyaLj49VIt\u2019s a potent, nostalgic triumvirate for social media users of a certain age, a highly specific Venn diagram of the comedy, technology, and music that many of them found edgy or important at the time \u2014 only to watch them decline into mediocrity or irrelevance as they grew older and the world moved on. This specialized intersection makes it all the more potent for those who recognize all the pieces of the puzzle and say, \u201cyes!\u201d There\u2019s something of a secret password element to this, a shibboleth that not only marks users of a certain age and experience but unites them.For example, if you aren\u2019t familiar with the subject matter and comedic cadence of a sixth season episode where the Simpson family travels to Australia \u2014 as well as the frustrations of trying to illegally download music without riddling your computer with viruses in 2005 \u2014 the following image will make little to no sense. If you do, well, you\u2019re welcome.Why is Limewire this weeks meme?   pic.twitter.com/SKZ631ZQrVIt\u2019s the memetic equivalent of \u201conly [insert generation] kids will remember this!\u201d And for those who do, there\u2019s a very particular pleasure in feeling seen, in feeling known, in feeling for a fleeting moment that the experiences and joys of your youth have not passed forever beyond the veil of irrelevance. In 2018, sometimes this means photoshopping a giant lime on to the face Homer Simpson. Who are we to judge?Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
