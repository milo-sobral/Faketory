{"id": "Russian woman charged with managing budget for US election interference plot", "paragraph": "The Department of Justice has unsealed a criminal complaint against a Russian national who allegedly attempted to interfere with US elections. Originally dated to late September, it accuses a St. Petersburg-based woman named Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova of acting as the chief accountant for Project Lakhta, an expansive political influence operation that\u2019s been mentioned in earlier indictments. This follows the indictment of several other Russian figures who allegedly conspired to manipulate the election.According to the criminal complaint, Khusyaynova managed the budget of Project Lakhta, funded by the companies Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering \u2014 both of which were mentioned in earlier indictments. The total operating budget between January 2016 and June 2018 was allegedly $35 million, which covered activities directed at the US, Russia, the European Union, and Ukraine. Among other things, Khusyaynova allegedly coordinated payment for expenditures like \u201cactivists, advertisements on social media platforms, registration of domain names, the purchase of proxy servers, and \u2018promoting news postings on social networks.\u2019\u201dThe complaint states that Khusyaynova kept \u201cdetailed financial documents\u201d that outlined payments for activities meant to undermine US elections. An itemized budget covering the year leading up to January 2017, for instance, listed expenses for Instagram, Facebook, and VKontakte ads. It also included budget lines for \u201cbloggers,\u201d \u201cdeveloping accounts\u201d on Twitter, and funding online videos. Between January and June of 2018, she submitted expenditures of roughly $60,000 for Facebook ads, $6,000 for Instagram ads, and $18,000 for bloggers and Twitter accounts. In its press release, the Justice Department thanked Facebook and Twitter for \u201cexceptional cooperation\u201d during the investigation.The release coincides with a joint statement from the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, expressing concern about \u201congoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies.\u201d The statement said that they \u201cdo not have any evidence\u201d of any breach that would let these operations prevent voting or change vote counts, but acknowledged the threat of propaganda and disinformation during the upcoming 2018 and 2020 elections.Today\u2019s complaint covers some territory seen in earlier cases, including the broad strokes of Lakhta\u2019s alleged goal: to \u201csow discord\u201d in the US political system by exaggerating the presence of extreme viewpoints online and aggravating existing political divides. It provides a number of examples of this propaganda. One guidance document, for instance, emphasizes that \u201ccolored LGBT are less sophisticated than white\u201d and are \u201cvery sensitive toward #whiteprivilege,\u201d so posters should \u201cbe careful dealing with racial content.\u201dAnother string of messages suggest finding ways to \u201cbrand [Sen. John] McCain as an old geezer who has lost it and who long ago belonged in a home for the elderly,\u201d in order to discredit his criticism of Donald Trump, and to brand fellow legislator Paul Ryan as \u201ca complete and absolute nobody incapable of any decisiveness.\u201dThe complaint also lists some specific names of fake identities used for misinformation: \u201cHelen Christopherson\u201d was a supposed New York City resident who became a co-coordinator of an anti-Trump flash mob, and \u201cBertha Malone\u201d was used to create over 400 inflammatory Facebook posts focused on immigration and Islam. She also created the \u201cStop AI\u201d Facebook page that appeared in a list of propaganda ads released last year. Again, some of these names were already known \u2014 like \u201cLuisa Haynes\u201d or @wokeluisa, whose popular liberal tweets were picked up by several news agencies before her identity was discovered.According to the complaint, net neutrality was one of the favored topics for debate, alongside gun rights, the 2018 midterm election, and negotiations with North Korea. An account with the handle @KaniJJackson reposted tweets praising Republican senators who voted for net neutrality rules and urging voters to \u201crepeal\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for voting against them.As before, the Justice Department emphasizes that it\u2019s not alleging this conspiracy actually influenced the election \u2014 only that there was a coordinated attempt to do so.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
