{"id": "Jake Paul\u2019s racism controversy reveals the flaw in Shane Dawson\u2019s docuseries", "paragraph": "Speaking purely in terms of raw numbers, Shane Dawson\u2019s eight-part documentary on the most notorious YouTuber on the planet has been a tremendous success \u2014 in less than 24 hours, the 105-minute finale has been watched 10 million times. Some fans, however, have questioned whether Dawson truly held Jake Paul accountable for his seemingly careless treatment of former colleagues, particularly when it came to racist remarks he\u2019s made; it\u2019s a criticism that speaks to one of the series\u2019 greatest \u2014 and perhaps defining \u2014 weaknesses.At the start of the documentary, Shane Dawson establishes that he wants to be hardline about Jake Paul. This is important, Dawson suggests, because, historically, he\u2019s acted more as a friend or confidant to his documentary subjects rather than interviewer, reporter, or skeptical party. He decides that he can\u2019t handle Jake Paul \u2014 a creator who has been criticized for performing dangerous stunts, overly promoting merchandise to a young and impressionable audience, and abusing his former colleagues \u2014 in the same way. \u201cI am way too nice, way too forgiving, way too loyal, and I don\u2019t wanna do that this time,\u201d Dawson says in the first episode. \u201cI want this time to, like, actually sit down in a room with him and be like, \u2018This is why people don\u2019t like you. This is what you did that was bad. I want you to tell me why you did it, be honest about it, and change your life. And fucking stop.\u2019\u201dDawson continues to hammer this point throughout his series, often playing up how tricky it will be to strike a good balance between doing his job as a documentarian and wanting to be the Nice Guy that empathizes with Jake Paul. When the pair sit down for the final interview, Dawson goes through a long list of sins that paint Jake Paul in a negative light. For each one, Paul explains his thought process and why he did what he did, and for the most part, Dawson doesn\u2019t really push back. Instead his responses are largely sympathetic to Paul\u2019s woes, and when he does counter them, he does so gently and unthreateningly. For the most part, that kind of approach is Dawson\u2019s modus operandi, one that is easy to overlook if we treat the series as a piece of entertainment. Even so, on social media Dawson\u2019s fans are in disbelief at how he handles Paul\u2019s explanation of a racism controversy involving former members of Team 10. Dawson\u2019s stumbles are a consequence of his generally toothless approach to Jake Paul, one that has come to define the series, for better or worse.Late last year, Spanish YouTubers Ivan and Emilio Martinez alleged that their departure from Jake Paul\u2019s influencer group had been because the YouTuber had bullied them, terrorizing them with pranks like destroying their room. The brothers speak English as a second language, which, they say created a barrier between them and the rest of Team 10; the divide was regularly widened by Paul, who would allegedly make racist remarks and mock their background and heritage.When Dawson brings this up to Jake Paul in the interview, the YouTuber denies that any physical abuse went on. All the pranks were fake, he says, and he would tell people about them in advance so they always knew what would happen. This arrangement was mutual, Paul says, and the brothers would tell him in advance of the practical jokes they\u2019d pull on him, too. \u201cMy vlogs are like, lightly scripted,\u201d Paul says. Dawson only nods. He does not ask Paul if he ever gave the brothers the option to say no, or if they felt pressured to agree to whatever pranks Paul thought of, no matter how dangerous, demeaning, or uncomfortable. He does, however, ask Paul if he feels their interactions were bad enough to justify the twins\u2019 departure. \u201cI think sometimes there was a language barrier when we would be joking around off-camera,\u201d Paul admits. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d see them get mad at me, but I would always try to fix it.\u201d Dawson then brings up the accusations of racism \u2014 the twins allege that Paul would call them \u201cbeaners,\u201d for instance \u2014 but he immediately couches the criticism by relating to Paul\u2019s childhood. Dawson grew up in an environment where anything could fly; if Paul grew up in similar circumstances, that would make it difficult to know when a line has been crossed. \u201cIt was aggressive, the jokes were crazy,\u201d says Dawson, who has come under fire for wearing blackface in the past. \u201cIt was offensive. And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s good. I wouldn\u2019t raise my kids that way, especially now. But, that\u2019s where I came from, right? So when I started YouTube, and I started saying jokes, and I started saying things with my friends and stuff, I didn\u2019t know it was too far.\u201dJake Paul takes the out, agreeing that this was the case for him, too. He says he waded in \u201chigh school locker-type vibes\u201d in the past; meanwhile, early footage of him on Vine mocking a Chinese accent plays onscreen. The Martinez twins, he explains, came onto his team composed of best friends who treated everything as a joke, where nothing was off-limits. \u201cWe\u2019d talk about each other\u2019s moms, we\u2019d talk about sisters, we\u2019d diss each other,\u201d Paul says. \u201cAnd anything anyone said about me, my family, it was all just jokes ... so when we\u2019d say jokes to the Martinez twins, I think at the time they thought it was funny, but then maybe looking back on it, they were like, \u2018Oh, they were like being racist.\u2019\u201dPaul admits that he would call the brothers beaners, but that it was a back and forth where they would also call him a cracker, or a stupid white person. \u201cWe would just like, give [the insults] back, bros being bros,\u201d Paul says. \u201cAnd when they left, I think they used that against us. To be like, \u2018They called us this and that,\u2019 when that was the culture in that house. And they did it to us, too.\u201d Without questioning any of this, Dawson insists he didn\u2019t notice that kind of culture when he was visiting the house. He only asks if Paul feels he\u2019s changed since then. \u201cOne hundred percent, those words wouldn\u2019t even come out of my mouth, \u2018cause ... to this day, I\u2019d be scared of someone just, even saying that I said something bad,\u201d Paul says. \u201c...I definitely learned from that situation, like, not everyone is gonna joke around in the same way. And even they are joking around, they might not actually be okay with that environment.\u201dEssentially thanking Paul for talking with him about this at all, Dawson then reassures him that it\u2019s okay to be mad at the twins for what they\u2019ve said about him. Paul, for his part, says he\u2019s still in disbelief about the brothers\u2019 Team 10 departure, given that he discovered them, taught them English, raised them out of poverty, and brought them into the influencer fold. He claims that they\u2019ve only accused him of racism because the controversy would help their career after leaving Team 10.\u201cI was, like, the first person that they would ever even feel comfortable to speak English with,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m mad about it.\u201d Most of the reception to the documentary has focused on subjects like Jake Paul\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but for some, the dilemma with the Martinez twins has taken center stage. #ShaneDawsonisOverParty was reportedly trending on Twitter at one point; right now, if you search \u201cShane Dawson\u201d on the website, it\u2019s not a highly visible hashtag, but many top results reference the discussion of racism.\u201cI\u2019m blocking ANYONE who still supports Shane Dawson after giving MULTIPLE FUCKING RACISTS a platform,\u201d one tweet declares, likely in reference to an earlier Shane Dawson interview with Jeffree Star, a beauty YouTuber who has been criticized for using the n-word in the past. \u201cShane Dawson: defending an abuser, defending racists, making platforms for all of them, loosing [sic] his shit when people call him out,\u201d another Tweet reads. Most tweets on the subject append some sort of video, GIF, or image that makes fun of how Dawson excuses, sympathizes, or doesn\u2019t really critique Paul\u2019s use of racist slurs. Despite his refusal to apologize for making offensive jokes in the past, it\u2019s undoubtedly a good thing that someone with Jake Paul\u2019s reach now thinks twice before making them again. But Dawson\u2019s insistence on being the likable good guy, no matter who he speaks to, highlights the biggest flaw with his docuseries: even if it\u2019s entertaining and successful, it can\u2019t deliver on his own self-imposed promise to stop being \u201cway too nice, way too forgiving, way too loyal.\u201d Most of all, he wants to have a good time with Jake Paul, outright saying so at one point during the series. Throughout, Dawson seems more committed to enjoying making the ill-advised documentary than he is to holding Paul accountable.spoiler alert: ur family to me now. love u too man. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/lAa6RI1hHbThis is not a work that wants you to think critically of Jake Paul as much as it is a series that really wants you to feel bad for Jake Paul \u2014 or perhaps even give you a list of reasons to like him. By the end of it, the whole thing feels like a glorified PR stunt that will help the younger Paul brother rehabilitate his unruly image: if Shane Dawson, the charming king of YouTube, loves Jake Paul, then who are you to hate him? No wonder Jake Paul feels comfortable coinciding the relaunch of his entire brand with the end of the series, when the views of sympathetic viewers are flowing his way."}
