{"id": "Chevy\u2019s new electric Camaro is the near future of EV drag racing ", "paragraph": "GM made a fun surprise announcement at this past week\u2019s Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show: an all-electric Chevrolet Camaro concept with 700 horsepower meant to bust out a quarter mile run in about nine seconds. And unlike EV performance cars like the NIO EP9 or the upcoming second-generation Tesla Roadster, which are purpose-built, the Camaro concept appears to be a beautiful, cobbled-together Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a car. The car, dubbed the eCOPO Concept (after the original COPO Camaro special order performance models from the late 1960s) looks like any other modern Camaro from the outside, even in electric blue paint. Inside is much different. For instance, the eCOPO is powered by a combination of BorgWarner electric motors, which are the same ones used in these Daimler electric trucks. The motors draw power from an 800-volt battery pack, which is twice as much as you\u2019d find in a Chevy Bolt. But the eCOPO doesn\u2019t use a \u201cskateboard\u201d style battery pack that takes up the whole floor of the car, which is pretty much the standard for EVs these days. Instead, the pack is split into four 200-volt modules that are tucked into different spots around the car\u2019s frame: two sit in the rear-seat area, and two are in the trunk, with one over the rear axle and one taking up the spot where the spare tire usually goes. GM says distributing the mass of the batteries like this helps improve performance on a drag strip, as it gives the car a 56 percent rear weight bias, which helps on launch. But it also shows how much of a sort of clever workaround effort this was on the part of Hancock and Lane, an electric drag racing team that helped Chevy build the car. \u201cThis project exemplifies Chevrolet and General Motors\u2019 commitment to engaging young minds in STEM education,\u201d Russ O\u2019Blenes, the director of performance variants, parts, and motorsports at GM, said in a statement. \u201cIt also represents our goal of a world with zero emissions, with the next generation of engineers and scientists who will help us get there.\u201d  GM\u2019s brands aren\u2019t involved in any of the current EV racing series like Formula E, but the eCOPO might be a sign that they\u2019re thinking about it as the company moves its fleet toward hybrid and electric power. And they\u2019re approaching it in an interesting way that might make electric racing a bit more accessible.\u201cI like that they\u2019re using proven off-the-shelf components and that they\u2019re pushing electric vehicles into motorsports,\u201d automotive journalist Bozi Tatarevic tells The Verge. \u201cThe motor that they are using is obviously stout since Daimler chose the same one for the eCanter. The inverters they are using are widely available and match up with their claims of running 800 volts.\u201d  Perhaps most important, Tatarevic says, is that the housing for the electric motors matches  that of GM\u2019s combustion LS motors, which are supremely popular. This \u201coffers an opportunity for other race cars to adapt the same system if they decide to offer it as a crate package,\u201d Tatarevic says, theoretically making it easier for people to explore EV drag racing beyond just bringing their Tesla to the track. O\u2019Blenes admitted as much in the official press release. \u201cThe possibilities are intriguing and suggest a whole new world for racers,\u201d he said. \u201cChevrolet pioneered the concept of the high-performance crate engine right around the time the original COPO Camaro models were created, and the eCOPO project points to a future that could include electric crate motors for racing, or even your street rod. We\u2019re not there yet, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re exploring.\u201dThe eCOPO is far from the first muscle car that\u2019s been retrofitted with electric power. Three years ago we met a man who turned his 1968 Ford Mustang into an 800-horsepower electric monster. A Maryland-based company called Genovation recently transformed a modern Chevy Corvette into a similarly powerful EV. Seeing a company support the effort to make a car like this, though, signals that there\u2019s interest in electric racing beyond purpose-built solutions like Formula E\u2019s cars. In fact, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) praised the concept this week. \u201cChevrolet\u2019s dedication to innovation and performance is evident in this new concept vehicle,\u201d NHRA president Glen Cromwell said in a statement. \u201cNHRA has been discussing and exploring how electric cars are evolving to determine how they will shape the future of drag racing. The new COPO Camaro is an exciting development in that process.\u201dCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
