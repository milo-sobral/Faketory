According to the department, Chinese intelligence officers and their operatives worked to steal the technology behind a turbofan engine used in commercial airliners. The scheme allegedly went on from at least early 2010 until May 2015, and targeted an unnamed French aerospace company that was working on the engine with a US company. Chinese intelligence officers allegedly hacked the French company, as well as aerospace companies in several states and the United Kingdom. Prosecutors said the hackers used techniques like spear phishing and malware to gain access to the confidential information. The indictment is the third of its kind announced by the Justice Department since last month. In one case, the department accused another Chinese intelligence officer of attempting to steal aircraft engine secrets, while a US Army recruit has been accused of working on behalf of Chinese intelligence. \u201cState-sponsored hacking is a direct threat to our national security,\u201d US Attorney Adam Braverman said in a statement. \u201cThis action is yet another example of criminal efforts by the MSS [China\u2019s Ministry of State Security] to facilitate the theft of private data for China\u2019s commercial gain.\u201dCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
