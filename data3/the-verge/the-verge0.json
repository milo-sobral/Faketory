{"id": "Saudi Arabia reportedly groomed Twitter employee to spy on user accounts ", "paragraph": "On Saturday, The New York Times published a report detailing Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to combat dissent on platforms like Twitter, such as slain US journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was subjected to intense and personal attacks online before his death. As part of those efforts, the kingdom\u2019s reportedly worked to groom a Twitter employee to spy on user accounts. According to the Times, western intelligence officials contacted the social media company, saying that the Saudi government was \u201cgrooming\u201d one of its employees, Ali Alzabarah, \u201cto spy on the accounts of dissidents and others.\u201d Alzabarah worked at Twitter beginning in 2013 as an engineer with access to user accounts, and was convinced by Saudi intelligence officials to look into several accounts. Once alerted, Twitter reportedly placed Alzabarah on administrative leave while an investigation took place, and while \u201cthey could not find evidence that he had handed over Twitter data to the Saudi government,\u201d he was fired at the end of 2015. The company then notified a \u201cfew dozen accounts\u201d that they might have been targeted. Following his dismissal, Alzabarah returned to Saudi Arabia. Reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson said that the company has \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d The Times says that among the accounts that were notified belonged to security researchers, academics, and journalists, including individuals who worked for the Tor project. Prior to his death, Khashoggi was involved in launching a project designed to combat online abuse. The report doesn\u2019t say if Khashoggi\u2019s accounts was one of the ones viewed by Alzabarah, but it does say that he had been subjected to attacks from the troll farms set up by the Saudi government to silence critics. The group was led by one of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s advisors, Saud al-Qahtani, who was fired recently from his post after the country admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in the Saudi\u2019s Turkish consulate. According to the Times, the group used group chats in messaging apps to distribute lists of people to harass, topics to monitor, and to issue pro-government messaging across multiple sock-puppet accounts. The group focused on topics like the war in Yemen and women\u2019s rights in the country, mass-reporting tweets to get Twitter to hide tweets by the people they were targeting. On Thursday, NBC News reported that Twitter suspended a botnet account that was used to push out pro-Saudi propaganda in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s death, and that this particular network, created between 2011 and 2017, used sophisticated tactics to avoid detection after the company implemented new rules to combat the use of such automated accounts.
