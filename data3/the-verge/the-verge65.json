{"id": "Apple\u2019s new MacBook Air faces strong Windows and iPad competition", "paragraph": "Steve Jobs changed the world of laptops 10 years ago when he introduced the MacBook Air by removing it from a tiny paper office envelope. It was a moment that shocked the audience at Apple\u2019s Macworld 2008 keynote, and sent shockwaves through the entire PC market. Apple created a wedge shaped laptop that at its thickest part was still thinner than the thinnest part of the Sony TZ Series \u2014 one of the thinnest laptops back in 2008. No other PC maker had anything that could compete, and it took years for the PC market to find an answer. \n    Related\n  Apple\u2019s MacBook Air from 10 years ago signaled a new era for laptops, but the company\u2019s latest refresh, unveiled earlier this week, shows how the competition has caught up. While the original MacBook Air dazzled the crowd 10 years ago, the model unveiled earlier this week is more a refresh than a revolution. A quiet revolution has been occurring in the Windows laptop space over the past decade, though.A big part of the appeal of the original MacBook Air was its reliable hardware. The keyboard had the right amount of travel, the glass trackpad felt buttery smooth, and you could open the lid and know it would reliably resume. You could even close the lid on a MacBook Air and the battery wouldn\u2019t drain even if you left it for weeks. The sleek wedge design and lightweight frame also made it very appealing if you wanted to travel light, and the battery life was solid. This combination of hardware was very appealing to consumers.Windows laptops at the time were a mess. Most were built out of plastic, with erratic trackpads that were so unreliable that PC users just got used to the poor experience. Booting up a Windows laptop was slow, and resuming was hit and miss. Battery life was also poor on many Windows laptops compared to the MacBook Air, and while some like Dell\u2019s Adamo managed to beat the thinness of the MacBook Air, none managed to beat the whole package for more than five years.I spent a lot of time searching for the perfect Windows laptop when Windows 8 was released in October 2012, and like many others I opted for a MacBook Air. Running Windows on a MacBook wasn\u2019t ideal, but it was simply the best option at the time. It wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the PC industry finally unveiled an answer to the MacBook Air. Dell\u2019s XPS 13 appeared at CES 2015 with an impressive edge-to-edge display, a glass trackpad, and a machined aluminum and carbon fiber design. I switched to it immediately, and it was this period of time when PC makers finally figured out how to compete with the MacBook Air.It was the same period in time that Microsoft had just released its Surface Pro 3 and reignited the Mac vs. PC conflict for its marketing campaign. While the Surface Pro 3 debuted with Windows 8, Microsoft had spent years developing Windows 10 to step away from its drastic tablet-focused changes in Windows 8. Microsoft also worked closely with Intel to improve Windows trackpads and the gestures in Windows 10 made PC laptops feel identical to the MacBook Air\u2019s trackpad. Apple\u2019s MacBook Air felt dated at the launch of Windows 10 in 2015, and the competition has grown even stronger recently.The best Windows laptops you can buy right now include devices from Huawei, HP, Microsoft, and Lenovo. While there was some experimentation during the Windows 8 days, the industry appears to have settled on a common 2-in-1 form factor that provides some tablet functionality alongside a more traditional laptop format. HP\u2019s Spectre X360 does a good job at this combination, while devices like Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 2 and Huawei\u2019s MateBook X Pro offer the traditional laptop in a modern touchscreen package.Surprisingly, Apple\u2019s new MacBook Air doesn\u2019t do much to overtake these latest crop of Windows laptops. A new high resolution display is now included on the MacBook Air, which was a much-needed addition after the existing Air has been available for $999 with a low resolution non-IPS display for 10 years. While Microsoft refreshed its Surface Laptop 2 with Intel\u2019s latest quad-core U series processors, Apple has opted for a less powerful dual-core Y series processor inside the new MacBook Air. Apple also decided to ship the latest generation of its controversial butterfly keyboard on the new MacBook Air. It\u2019s still too early to know whether the improvements Apple has made to the butterfly switches are enough to combat dust issues, but it\u2019s still a keyboard that people either love or hate.Apple did add Touch ID to its latest MacBook Air, although a bigger improvement would be Face ID. Windows 10 introduced support for Windows Hello, to allow you to log into a PC with just your face. Most modern Windows laptops now include Windows Hello, and Face ID would be a welcome improvement to any MacBook.Most of Apple\u2019s more notable hardware improvements appear to have been reserved for the iPad Pro. Apple added Face ID to its latest iPad Pro, and a powerful A12X processor. It\u2019s built on 7nm technology, and has an 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU. Apple claims the new iPad Pros are faster than 92 percent of all portable PCs sold in the last 12 months, and the new hardware \u201cdelivers Xbox One S-class graphics performance.\u201d These performance advances on the iPad Pro combined with reduced bezels and Face ID are far more impressive than a refreshed MacBook Air. Apple\u2019s new MacBook Air won\u2019t drive the laptop market forward significantly, but the iPad Pro is stealthily making advancements. It\u2019s been clear for some time that Apple is prioritizing the iPad Pro over the MacBook as its consumer \u201ccomputer\u201d of choice, but it was made even clear during Apple\u2019s event earlier this week. Apple revealed it has sold more iPads in the past year than the entire lineup of notebooks from any single manufacturer. \u201cThis makes iPad not only the most popular tablet, but the most popular computer in the world,\u201d said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple also revealed there are 100 million active Mac devices worldwide, compared to the 1.5 billion active Windows PCs figure that Microsoft briefly revealed last weekend before replacing it with the company\u2019s 700 million Windows 10 figure. It\u2019s no surprise that Apple will focus on iPad over Mac, as Mac is just 6 percent of the overall desktop PC market. While Apple didn\u2019t mention the active number of iPads, Cook did reveal more than 400 million iPads have been sold to date. Even if only half of those are still active today, that\u2019s still double the amount of active Mac devices worldwide.Throughout 2017 Mac sales continued to buck the PC industry trend and grow year-over-year, even if most quarters experienced tiny growth. During 2018 Mac sales have consistently dropped every quarter, while iPad sales have been mostly flat. Apple still makes more revenue from Mac sales than iPad sales, but if it can convince more consumers to opt for an iPad Pro than a MacBook Air or another Windows laptop then that will change. This year\u2019s iPad Pro is priced at $799 for the 11-inch model, a $150 price increase from the previous 10.5-inch version. The larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro now starts at $999 instead of the previous $799 starting price. When you factor in the price of an iPad keyboard (which also increased) then a 12.9-inch iPad Pro is now the same price as a base model MacBook Air ($1,199). That sets up an interesting choice of picking between macOS, iOS, or a Windows-based machine. Apple is now going to make it difficult to see how people are making that choice. Apple has traditionally been surprisingly transparent with its Mac and iPad sales numbers, reporting them every quarter unlike the rest of the industry. That\u2019s all about to change, though, as Apple\u2019s price hike strategy shows early signs of paying off. Apple will no longer report sales numbers for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, so it will make it more difficult to see just how well the MacBook Air and iPad Pro compete against traditional PC laptops.The debate over tablet vs. laptop will rage on for many years, but it\u2019s clear that Apple\u2019s new MacBook Air now faces stronger competition than it has ever faced before. The PC industry has changed for the better, thanks to both the MacBook Air and the iPad, but it\u2019s the iPad that will now shape its future and not the new MacBook Air.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
