{"id": "Kickstarter to end Drip, fund new platform with XOXO festival creators", "paragraph": "Nearly a year after launching its subscriber-based crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter announced today that Drip is on the way out. Fortunately, for the creators currently working with Drip as well as anyone looking for an alternative to Patreon, Kickstarter isn\u2019t abandoning the platform. Instead, the company is providing seed funding to XOXO festival creators Andy Baio and Andy McMillan to create an entirely new one with an explicit focus on providing financial stability and transparency to independent artists.The new initiative came about through conversations between Kickstarter founder Perry Chen and Baio, a former Kickstarter CTO. \u201cYou start thinking, what\u2019s next, what are the possibilities?\u201d says Chen. \u201cAs we talked more and more, I ended up thinking that this could be a good way for this to progress, for [Baio] and [McMillan] to build on what we\u2019ve done with Drip over the last year.\u201dBaio and McMillan have a reputation for working with and supporting independent artists, primarily through their work at the annual XOXO arts and tech festival that they created in 2012. \u201cSo much of the festival is about helping independent artists and celebrating their work and helping them connect with one another,\u201d says Baio. \u201cBut there\u2019s the financial component, too. And helping them getting ongoing funding for their work is something we\u2019ve been thinking about for the better part of a decade.\u201dThere is no specific launch date for the as-yet-unnamed platform, but Kickstarter will continue to run Drip for the next year until existing Drip creators can be migrated there or to another service of their choosing. Baio and McMillan have incorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC) for the project, much like Kickstarter, which reincorporated in 2015 as a PBC. The new platform they want to build is \u201cmuch more community driven, much more social,\u201d says Baio. \u201cThe thing we keep coming back to is building something that works for every project, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re currently seeking funding.\u201dThe duo emphasizes again and again that they understand the responsibility that comes with this sort of subscription-based funding, which many creators rely on to pay their bills month to month. \u201cIt\u2019s different from project-based funding like Kickstarter,\u201d says Baio. \u201cYou need to be around for a long time. We are specifically structuring it as we go to make something that is as sustainable as possible.\u201dThe pair remains uncertain about the policies they will adopt around NSFW content. McMillan says that while they wanted to support as many creators as they can, \u201cthere are complex technical problems in supporting [NSFW content], like payment gateways. We need to look into how technologically possible it is to support those creators but I would say that we have a history of prioritizing and including those people in the community and that\u2019s a priority for us moving forward.\u201dWhen asked whether LGBT content would be flagged as adult content, even if it is not explicit \u2014 a controversy that has recently erupted around Patreon \u2014 Baio\u2019s response was succinct: \u201cLGBT content is not inherently explicit or NSFW in any way.\u201dBaio and McMillan also emphasized that they planned to be communicative with their creators about any significant changes to the service, particularly anything that would affect the income of the people on the platform. \u201cEssentially what you\u2019re offering here is financial stability for independent artists,\u201d says McMillan. \u201cThe thing that we are producing for these people is going to look like a piece of software, but really it\u2019s financial stability. And we have to be incredibly respectful of bringing people into this ecosystem, in everything that we do. One aspect of that is inevitably is going to be radical transparency whenever we decide that we\u2019re going to change something.\u201dAlthough early phases of the new platform may be invite-only, their goal is to make it open to everyone. And despite the seed money, Chen makes it clear that Kickstarter will have no oversight or control over the project. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to support,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s their ship to steer. And that\u2019s exactly the way it should be.\u201dCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
