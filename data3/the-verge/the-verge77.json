Subscribe to the newsletter here.\n  As the midterms approach, a central question has been how campaigns would adapt to the fact their digital ads were now public. Thanks to online archives established this year by Facebook, Google, Twitter, we now have unprecedented visibility into campaigns. But as I\u2019ve noted here a couple times now, advertisers are working hard to make themselves less visible. The tug-of-war between transparency and obscurity is turning out to be one of the defining stories of this election.ProPublica identified a dozen ad campaigns from industry lobbying groups that obscured their true backers.The 12 ad campaigns, for which Facebook received a total of more than $800,000, expose a significant gap in enforcement of its new disclosure policy, and they cast doubt on Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s assurance to the U.S. Senate in September that \u201cyou can see who paid for\u201d ads. Adopted this past May in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook\u2019s rules are designed to hinder foreign meddling in elections by verifying that individuals who run ads on its platform have a U.S. mailing address, governmental ID and a Social Security number. But, once this requirement has been met, Facebook doesn\u2019t check whether the advertiser identified in the \u201cpaid for by\u201d disclosure has any legal status, enabling U.S. businesses to promote their political agendas secretly.Facebook told reporter Jeremy B. Merrill that it didn\u2019t have the resources to evaluate every submitted advertiser name to evaluate its authenticity.Rob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management, said Facebook doesn\u2019t try to verify the provenance of every political ad. The lack of a \u201creliable source to look and see every possible entity name that would be valid, including \u2018doing business as\u2019 names,\u201d would make it a herculean task, he said. \u201cWe have to rely on the things that we can scalably look at.\u201d Facebook primarily monitors disclaimers for profanity, names of hate groups and \u201cvague or inaccurate\u201d descriptions, as well as URLs (banned because they\u2019re not official names), he said.Notably, Twitter takes a different \u2014 and possibly more effective \u2014 approach:Twitter verifies advertisers\u2019 names via their Employer Identification Numbers, making it harder for the actual sponsors to hide. For instance, ads from Energy In Depth carried a disclaimer on Twitter \u2014 but not on Facebook \u2014 that they were paid for by Independent Petroleum Association of America.It\u2019s something for Facebook to consider as its ad archive evolves over time.The flip side of advertiser disclosures is that platforms are asking people to verify their identities in order to post plainly apolitical material. The Atlantic stress-tested the algorithms responsible for determining ads\u2019 political content and found a bunch of mistakes:Most of the ads that Facebook prohibited were for national parks or Veterans Day parades. One prohibited ad advertised a music album that shared a name with a candidate. Facebook prohibited 5 percent of our ads for Veterans Day gatherings. Facebook also prohibited 18 percent of national park ads linking to government websites. When we appealed some these decisions, Facebook\u2019s reviewers reversed them, confirming our belief that they were initially mistakes.Maybe these mistakes aren\u2019t so surprising. Overall, Facebook prohibited 11 percent of our park and parade ads and 1 percent of product ads that included a candidate name, a difference of 10 percentage points. Political ads often mention imagery and values common to many Americans. Machine-learning models designed to detect these political ads could easily learn these features and systematically prohibit information and ideas central to nonpartisan American civic life. Whatever the reason, the company prohibited fewer product ads.I understand it must be annoying to have to send Facebook a post card in order to buy an ad for an event at a national park. And yet also \u2026 I can\u2019t really bring myself to care. A few false positives seem more than worth the trade-offs involved here.In their conclusion, the Atlantic authors lay it on thick: \u201cThe greatest collateral damage from these protections could be the nonpartisan communities and conversations that divided societies most desperately need.\u201d Facebook is not banning those nonpartisan communities, though. It\u2019s asking them to mail in a postcard.That, I think, democracy can survive.Midterm Election 2018: Tracking Campaign Ads From Health Care to Taxes and JobsSpeaking of ads, Bloomberg has a beautiful data visualization of the subjects of political ads across the country right now, broken down by location and medium.In many parts of the country, candidates and groups supporting them are still appealing to pocket books, focusing their ads on tax cuts and job growth. Elsewhere, politics are still local\u2014topics like public safety, teachers\u2019 salaries and tariffs on crops are all driving the political conversation. In Tennessee, it\u2019s all about praise for President Donald Trump; in Washington D.C., anti-Trump fervor has dominated.Bloomberg News analyzed more than 3 million election ads for 2018 congressional and gubernatorial races to get a sense of the most commonly discussed issue in 210 local television markets, as defined by the Nielsen Company. Across the U.S., 16 different topics are mentioned more than anything else during midterm TV ads.Facebook Allowed Advertisers to Target Users Interested in \u201cWhite Genocide\u201d \u2014 Even in Wake of Pittsburgh MassacreAnd still speaking of ads, because it\u2019s all anyone is speaking about, this isn\u2019t great:Earlier this week, The Intercept was able to select \u201cwhite genocide conspiracy theory\u201d as a pre-defined \u201cdetailed targeting\u201d criterion on the social network to promote two articles to an interest group that Facebook pegged at 168,000 users large and defined as \u201cpeople who have expressed an interest or like pages related to White genocide conspiracy theory.\u201d The paid promotion was approved by Facebook\u2019s advertising wing. After we contacted the company for comment, Facebook promptly deleted the targeting category, apologized, and said it should have never existed in the first place.Private messages from 81,000 hacked Facebook accounts for saleRussian hackers told the BBC that they have obtained personal information from 120 million accounts. Facebook says that it was not compromised, that the number is likely overstated, and that any data leak is likely the fault of a rogue third-party browser extension. I have no idea what to make of this story:The hackers offered to sell access for 10 cents (8p) per account. However, their advert has since been taken offline.\u201cWe have contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores,\u201d said Facebook executive Guy Rosen. \u201cWe have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts.\u201dGoogle CEO Pichai Says He\u2019s Still the Boss Amid Employee RevoltsSundar Pichai wants to remind you that, yesterday\u2019s walkout notwithstanding, he is in charge of Google:\u201cWe don\u2019t run the company by referendum,\u201d Pichai said at a conference in New York on Thursday. \u201cThere are many good things about giving employees a lot of voice, out of that we have done well.\u201cChina is making the internet less free, and US tech companies are helpingShannon Liao looks at the connection between internet companies\u2019 embrace of China and yesterday\u2019s Freedom House report about the decline of the free internet:As US companies work to reach China\u2019s nearly 1 billion internet users, the promise of profits seems to outweigh the dwindling of online freedom that it could help accelerate. Hundreds of US internet services in China are already blocked, and the ones that remain available have completely acquiesced to the government. While it\u2019s possible that American companies will be able to grow in China without compromising their values, the experience of many US companies of late proves just how hard, if not impossible, that may be.How Apple News is covering the midtermsWill Oremus looks at Apple\u2019s plans to cover the midterms. Which is an unbelievably weird sentence to type y\u2019all!Launched in June, Apple\u2019s Midterm Elections project is already in full swing. But starting at 8 p.m. ET on Nov. 6, the company will launch a redesigned, election-night version. Midterms news will take over the top of both the app\u2019s main \u201cToday\u201d feed and its \u201cDigest\u201d tab, while also being featured in the widget that appears when you swipe right from the home screen of an iOS device. The section will lead with the latest results based on data from the Associated Press, which will update once a minute without making you refresh the page. And it will pipe in live TV coverage from at least two major networks, along with clips from CNN, Fox News, and others, without requiring users to log in as pay-TV subscribers.Top Apple executives have publicly advocated for the company\u2019s decidedly editorial approach to picking news stories. \u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d its chief of apps, Roger Rosner, told the New York Times recently. That\u2019s a responsibility from which Facebook and other internet companies have shied, professing to be mere tools for their users to communicate with one another.Peter Thiel says Russian ads on Facebook didn\u2019t help Trump win electionWell that settles that, then! Sorry to have asked. (Oh wait but also this.)Twitter Listed A Trending Topic For \u201cKill All Jews\u201d After A Brooklyn Synagogue Was VandalizedHere is your reminder for today that it is long past time to retire \u201ctrending topics\u201d from social feeds. They are easily gamed, prone to being abused, and platforms refuse to dedicate staff to seeing what keywords are trending until it\u2019s too late.Google\u2019s top Washington lobbyist is leaving roleSusan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman, will leave the company at the end of the year, David McCabe reports. She\u2019ll retain an advising role:Earlier this year, the company hired GE executive Karan Bhatia to lead its global policy efforts. Bhatia said in an email to policy employees working on the Americas that Molinari \u201cwill focus on the critically important goal of strengthening our relationships with key external constituents\u201d and will report to him.Alt-Right and Alt-Social MediaBy now you\u2019ve heard of Gab. But are you familiar with other right-wing social networks, such as Seen.life and Voat? The Digital Forensics Research Lab is here to introduce you:Seen.life is advertised as a \u201cfree speech\u201d Facebook alternative. It appears to be a subsidiary of fringe media outlet BeforeItsNews.com, run by Temporal Media Ltd. It\u2019s worth noting that BeforeItsNews.com does not mention their shared ownership in their advertorials for Seen.Life.Alt-right, xenophobic, and Anti-Semitic content is particularly prevalent on Seen.Life. Among the most popular groups on this nascent social networking site is \u201cRise Against Islam\u201d. It describes itself as a group dedicated to \u201cresolving the [Islam] situation\u201d and calls moderate Muslims to \u201cchange their belief system or face the wrath of the countries they are trying to occupy.\u201dUnfold launches a design agency for Instagram StoriesKatharine Schwab profiles Alfonso Cobo, whose app for building Instagram stories has 11 million downloads:That\u2019s where Unfold, an app specifically for Instagram Story templates, is poised to help. Founded in March 2017 by Alfonso Cobo\u2013an architect by training\u2013Unfold began as an app for designers to create portfolios via iPad, before Cobo realized that Instagram Stories were catching on. At the time, \u201cInstagram Stories was really limited in terms of tools and how we could showcase our work in this platform,\u201d Cobo says. \u201cI saw there was a huge potential in Stories.\u201dThe Unfold app features seamless UX that lets you build a story out by electing individual page templates from five different series, each with a different aesthetic, and then add photos and text. Once you\u2019ve designed the whole thing, you can download it to your phone, where each page will save as a separate image, easily uploadable to Instagram (or you share directly on the app itself).Snapchat will display polling locations in its Snap Map on Election DayGood on Snap for this:In preparation for the US midterm elections on November 6th, Snapchat is now adding election-themed lenses and filters that will guide voters to their polling locations through its Snap Map on Election Day. According to Engadget, the filters will dress up your Bitmoji in a special costume on your Snap Map.The feature is part of Snapchat\u2019s continued effort to encourage young voters to go to the polls. In September, the app displayed a link to a voter registration page on the profile of every user over 18, resulting in over 400,000 users registering to vote in two weeks.Tencent is launching its own version of Snap SpectaclesHere\u2019s a Snapchat clone I didn\u2019t see coming: China\u2019s Tencent now has its own version of Spectacles. Rita Liao and Jon Russell report:Tencent, which is best known for operating China\u2019s massively popular WeChat messenger, has been an investor in Snap for some time after backing it long before it went public. But, when others have criticized the company and its share price struggled, Tencent doubled down. It snapped up an additional 12 percent stake one year ago and it is said to have offered counsel to Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on product strategy. We don\u2019t know, however, if the two sides\u2019 discussions have ever covered Spectacles and thus inspired this new Tencent take on then.The purpose behind Tencent\u2019s new gadget is implicit in its name. Weishi, which means \u201cmicro videos\u201d in Chinese, is also the name of the short-video sharing app that Tencent has been aggressively promoting in recent months to catch up with market dominators TikTok and Kuaishou .Facebook Gives Away AI Tools Used to Improve Video, MessengerThe realm of artificial intelligence is so competitive that the big tech platforms are making many of their tools open source. This week Facebook made available a tool that optimizes elements of video display and notifications:Facebook used this set of tools internally to optimize how 360-degree videos are displayed on the social network, taking into account such factors as the available bandwidth and how much of the video has already been buffered. The same tools, according to the blog post, were also used to improve what content to push to users through notifications. And it was used to hone the suggestions that its intelligence assistant, which is called M, makes to users of its Messenger app.The Horizon software is focused on reinforcement learning, in which software improves itself by trial-and-error from experience to maximize some reward or minimize some loss, rather than from labeled data sets.Political Reality: Buy Ads on Facebook or Risk Losing the ElectionChristopher Mims notes that even the politicians who have questioned Facebook most sternly generally still buy ads there:That few politicians feel they can escape the necessity of advertising on Facebook is precisely why we need to contemplate its ever-growing scale, revenue and power. The ramp-up in political spending across Facebook\u2019s social networks, which also include Instagram, is breathtaking: In 2014, digital ad spending was 1% of all political ad spending. Now it\u2019s 22%, or about $1.9 billion, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Facebook says that politicians have spent nearly $300 million in the U.S. on Facebook ads since May. As of Oct. 30, Democrats were outspending Republicans on Facebook 3 to 1.Politicians who want to reach the same voters their competitors are reaching on Facebook have little choice but to go there, too. That\u2019s despite mounting criticism that Facebook\u2019s algorithms are actually driving increased political polarization and concerns that the site serves as a vector for influence campaigns by Russia and now Iran. Facebook, a driver of our fractious political debate, can be seen as profiting from the fallout.Nothing is more terrifying than this Slack spoofMegan Farrokhmanesh has a fun roundup of the week\u2019s best memes, which includes several Halloween costumes you should go out of your way to see.
