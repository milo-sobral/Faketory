{"id": "It costs $649 to repair the new iPad Pro without AppleCare+", "paragraph": "Apple\u2019s newest iPad Pro, announced today in New York, is one of the most expensive tablets the company has ever made. The cheapest option starts at $799 for the 64GB 11-inch iPad Pro, and it can run all the way up to a whopping $1,899 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with LTE. That also makes the new iPads also the most expensive to repair, if you\u2019re out of warranty and don\u2019t have AppleCare+, Apple\u2019s extended warranty program.Apple\u2019s support page for iPad repairs lists the fees to repair each tablet if it\u2019s out of warranty. AppleCare+, which costs $129 for a two-year iPad Pro warranty, covers two incidents of accidental damage as well as other malfunctions. But if you let your complimentary limited warranty run out after a year, and your new 12.9-inch iPad Pro needs repairs, you\u2019ll have to pay $649 to get it fixed. Apple\u2019s first year of limited warranty doesn\u2019t even cover accidental damage, just defects, so if you break your iPad two days after you get it, you\u2019ll still have to pay $649.The AppleCare+ service fee remains $49 across all iPads for now, which seems cheap compared to how much Apple charges for AppleCare+ for its iPhones. AppleCare+ with theft and loss deductibles can run up to $269 for the iPhone XS, which seems unnecessarily expensive for a phone that already costs over $1,000. But it still might be a better one-time investment than having to pay $649 if you need your iPad Pro repaired and you\u2019re out of warranty.Correction: The original version of the article misstated that Apple\u2019s complimentary limited warranty was 90 days, and that it covers accidental damage. Apple\u2019s limited warranty is one year of hardware repair coverage, and it doesn\u2019t cover accidental damage. We regret the error.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
