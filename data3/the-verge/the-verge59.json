{"id": "Faraday Future founder resigns, employees being furloughed amid cash crunch", "paragraph": "Faraday Future is nearly out of money following a fight with its main investor, a founder has resigned, and the company is taking even more drastic measures to keep the company from collapsing until new investment comes in, The Verge has learned. Last week\u2019s layoffs and salary cuts have not trimmed enough of the some $10 million monthly payroll, so management has decided to shut down some operations this week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Gardena, California, and at its factory in Hanford, California. Workers will be placed on unpaid leave, or a \u201cfurlough,\u201d until new funding is secured, according to an email from CEO Jia Yueting obtained by The Verge.In addition, Nick Sampson, one of Faraday Future\u2019s three co-founders, resigned on Tuesday, according to a separate email obtained by The Verge. His departure comes just one day after Peter Savagian, a longtime GM executive and Faraday Future\u2019s senior vice president of technology and product development, also left the company. And it follows last week\u2019s news of layoffs and salary cuts, which came as a result of a fight with Faraday Future\u2019s main financial backer, Chinese real estate giant Evergrande Group. After this article was published, Faraday Future spokesperson John Schilling confirmed Sampson and Savagian\u2019s departures in an email to The Verge. \u201cWe wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors,\u201d he wrote.\u201cThe company is effectively insolvent in both its financial and personnel assets, it will at best will [sic] limp along for the foreseeable future. I feel that my role in Faraday Future is no long [sic] a path that I can follow, so I will leave the company, effective immediately,\u201d Sampson wrote. \u201cI cannot continue knowing the devestating [sic] impact we are having on the lives of our employees, their families and loved ones as we as the [sic] ripple effect this will have on lives throughout our suppliers and the industry as a whole.\u201dSampson added that \u201cif circumstances should materially change, I certainly would consider returning to the company.\u201dFaraday Future\u2019s CEO (and only remaining founder) Jia says in his email that all employees who started working after May 1st of this year \u201cmust take a furlough.\u201d Full-time staff workers who have been with Faraday Future since before May 1st will have the option to remain on board with a reduced salary of $50,000 per year, according to the current and former employees. Hourly workers who have been with the company for more than six months will be allowed to stay on, but at minimum wage, the current and employees say. Jia said the furlough will last at least through December, and is dependent on finding new funding. \u201cWe are grateful to all of the hundreds of employees who are willing to stay with the minimum wage [sic] and continue to work on the FF91 core project,\u201d Jia wrote. \u201cThis was an extremely tough decision to make, and we recognize the emotional stress and financial strain this puts on people\u2019s personal lives.\u201d Have information about Jia Yueting, or Faraday Future?

I am sorry and sad that this day has been reached but I must do what my heart tells me.\u201d Faraday Future\u2019s discord with Evergrande Group resulted in layoffs and wage cuts \u2014 of 20 percent \u2014 last week, as well as stalled payments to a number of suppliers. The company had spent the first $800 million from Evergrande by July, and it was denied an advance on the remaining $1.2 billion after taking the case to arbitration in Hong Kong. The arbitrator did allow Faraday Future to seek up to $500 million in new investment money, but it is subject to Evergrande\u2019s approval. Jia said in Tuesday\u2019s email that Faraday Future is \u201ccurrently engaged in conversations with investors from different backgrounds.\u201d Faraday Future signed a lease for the Hanford factory in August 2017, and it promised the local government that it would eventually create around 1,300 jobs. The company spent most of 2018 refurbishing the factory \u2014 which had sat dormant since 2001 when it was used to make Pirelli Tires \u2014 to get it ready for the production of the company\u2019s electric luxury SUV, the FF91. It bought the Gardena headquarters in 2014 and has occupied the building ever since.
