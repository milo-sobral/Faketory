{"id": "Daredevil\u2019s \u2018suffering makes a man\u2019 trope is common, familiar, and bad for everyone", "paragraph": "Like the first two seasons of Netflix\u2019s Daredevil series, the third season loves to show its hero getting beaten up. For the first few episodes, Daredevil, aka Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), is convalescing after the events in Netflix\u2019s Defenders crossover miniseries, and the camera lingers lovingly on his battered face and body, watching him stagger about the screen in an ecstasy of infirmity and pain. When he\u2019s somewhat recovered and back battling bad guys, the fight sequences are grinding, extended affairs. Viewers are meant to feel it viscerally every time a nose shatters or a rib cracks. Murdock emerges from each conflict bloodied, bruised, and exhausted \u2014 and in one notable instance, with a pair of scissors sticking out of his chest. Daredevil depicts Matt Murdock in pain because enduring that pain is what makes him a hero. He\u2019s not alone, either. Whether it\u2019s Daniel Craig laughing and joking through a brutal testicle-whipping in Casino Royale, or Bruce Willis pulling broken glass out of his bare feet in Die Hard and continuing to fight, men in action movies and television series are constantly expected to shrug off tremendous damage, including being shot, stabbed, and graphically tortured. These narratives of stoic anguish make it seem natural and unremarkable for men to coldly ignore pain in real life. And at the same time, the trope usually makes women\u2019s suffering seem uninteresting or marginal.The most obvious result of glamorizing and exaggerating men\u2019s imperviousness to pain is that men who suffer feel like they are supposed to endure it without complaint. Deadpool 2, as just one example, actually starts with the protagonist trying to kill himself out of grief. He literally blows himself into small pieces \u2014 but he has regenerative powers, so he\u2019s back in the next scene, wisecracking and complaining. His attempted suicide is played off as a joke; his depression and despair are just another way to demonstrate his invulnerability.The Deadpool version of the story is an extreme exaggeration, and just one of many gags that\u2019s reaching for subversion by making light of the most serious subjects the screenwriters can find. But the \u201cheroes suffer, and it doesn\u2019t slow them down\u201d cultural trope does reflect a common social stereotype. Men are expected to shrug off setbacks and power through emotional difficulties without sharing or showing them. Films glamorize heroes who don\u2019t feel anything but anger or fear \u2014 and who then find ways to make the anger dominant. It\u2019s a culturally ubiquitous message that makes it more difficult for men to seek help when they\u2019re emotionally distressed or depressed. That\u2019s part of the reason men account for 77 percent of suicide deaths in America, killing themselves at almost four times the rate that women do. \u201cWomen are far more likely to acknowledge that they have depression and seek help,\u201d according to Amit Anand, a professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lerner College of Medicine.Pushing through pain is supposed to be heroic and manly. But pain is even more validating if it\u2019s suffered in pursuit of some worthy goal, like protecting weaker people through the sheer force of endurance. Daredevil\u2019s injuries are the result of fighting the good fight; he\u2019s battling to save his city and to stand between his friends and the dangers that threaten them. He isn\u2019t beaten and tortured for no reason \u2014 it\u2019s in the line of the duty he\u2019s chosen for himself. Like most superheroes, he shows his strength by using it on other people\u2019s behalf. The idea that it\u2019s honorable for men to suffer while doing their job is similarly reflected in the real world, and it comes out through workplace injury numbers. Getting injured on the job is overwhelmingly linked to gender. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the men were the victims of 93 percent of fatal work injuries.Men are injured so often at work in part because sexist barriers to hiring women, plus the gender expectations for certain jobs, mean that high-risk occupations are often overwhelmingly male. The 11 people killed on the Deepwater Horizon in 2010 were all men, for example, because jobs on oil rigs are overwhelmingly male. As on oil rigs, so at war: while women make up a greater share of military personnel than they did in the past, men continue to be the vast majority of soldiers on active duty \u2014 85 percent in 2015. That\u2019s reflected in death tolls; as of 2018, the conflict in Afghanistan has killed 2,297 American men and 50 women.But men are also vulnerable to injury because they\u2019re more likely to indulge in high-risk behaviors than women. Daredevil insists on trying to prepare himself for combat even when his injuries mean he\u2019s hardly able to stand. Guys are socialized to disregard their health, safety, and lives in pursuit of a greater cause \u2014 whether that\u2019s fighting crime in New York, or extracting oil. And by the same token, because it\u2019s supposed to be okay for men to sacrifice their health for work, companies have less incentive to make heavily male, high-risk workplaces safe. Similarly, war is justified because it gives men a chance to prove themselves through endurance and callousness. The famous ambivalently anti-war film Full Metal Jacket ends with its main character, Joker, forced to shoot a wounded sniper in cold blood. That moment of psychological trauma is painful, which is meant to make it validating. \u201cHardcore,\u201d one of the onlookers breathes as the deed is done, and Joker \u2014 who is, appropriately, his outfit\u2019s joker \u2014 becomes a warrior.It\u2019s no accident that the sniper Joker shoots is a woman. Male suffering onscreen often is built on female suffering, which it obscures and expropriates. The trope-definining instance came in a 1994 Green Lantern comic, in which the hero discovers his girlfriend murdered and stuffed in their refrigerator. Pointing to this comic in particular, comic writer Gail Simone coined the term fridging to describe the common plot device in which a woman is murdered, mutilated, or sexually assaulted in order to traumatize the man closest to her, giving him a worthy motive for violence and revenge.But the strange flip side of the cultural emphasis on tough, impervious men is that when men do let their pain out, they may be taken more seriously than women, because of the assumption that women are emotional all the time, while any emotions men are unable to hold inside must be overwhelming. \u201cWe are primed, almost from birth, to find men\u2019s emotions more serious and more worthy of empathy than women\u2019s,\u201d author Sady Doyle wrote earlier this month, in response to the Senate testimony of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In his response to sexual assault allegations, Kavanaugh shouted, cried, and belligerently claimed to have been wronged, putting his pain on display. That resonated for many viewers because male pain is such a powerful narrative trope, and men expressing it openly goes so counter to cultural expectations that it\u2019s taken seriously when it happens.Some commenters criticized Kavanaugh for his weakness in breaking down, but others were clearly moved by the spectacle he made of his suffering. \u201cMen can afford pain,\u201d Doyle wrote, \u201cbecause when faced with the spectacle of male pain, our culture\u2019s first instinct is to look for whatever is making him uncomfortable and remove it\u200a \u2014\u200a and, more often than not, what is making him uncomfortable is a woman asking for more than he\u2019s prepared to give.\u201dDaredevil season 3 is also built on the erasure of a woman\u2019s agony. The Defenders ends with a building falling on Daredevil and his love / nemesis Elektra (Elodie Yung). The physical punishment Daredevil suffers is a reflection of the inner torment he feels because he\u2019s responsible for Elektra\u2019s death. Her suffering is more a part of his story than her own; it adds interest to him, without being important in itself. In the same vein, newly introduced Daredevil villain Bullseye (Wilson Bethel) is a troubled young man whose violence is motivated by one woman who dies of cancer, and another whom he stalks and frightens. The suffering of women is a narrative sideline, which motivates two men to dramatically, viciously beat the snot out of each other.Like so many action heroes, Daredevil is cool because he\u2019s tough. He gets punched and kicked and he just keeps punching back. Pain and manliness validate each other in action stories, creating wish-fulfillment scenarios where the audience can imagine being just as calm under fire as their heroes, just as impervious to any physical or emotional pain they feel, just as capable of shrugging off whatever hurts or frightens them. But an obsessive focus on men expressing themselves primarily through anger and invulnerability can make suffering seem heroic in itself \u2014 which is why the series, in every season, is so eager to show scenes of Daredevil torturing people. When pain is what makes a man, everybody of every gender who comes in contact with men ends up suffering along with them.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
