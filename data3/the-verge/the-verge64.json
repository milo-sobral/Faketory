{"id": "Why Guillermo del Toro\u2019s attention to detail makes his movie monsters stand out ", "paragraph": "Guillermo del Toro is behind some of cinema\u2019s most inventive and visually-pleasing genre films in recent years \u2014 Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, Hellboy, and The Shape of Water all enjoy stunning costume and set design that complement their stories and which stand out from the rest of what you might see in theaters. A new video from YouTuber Kristian Williams, (aka kaptainkristian) explores why the filmmaker\u2019s movie monsters are so memorable, especially in an age when CGI is so prevalent. A key reason for why del Toro\u2019s films are so memorable is the attention to detail and effort put into the design of his characters, and how they interact with their surroundings. In Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, Williams notes that the faun complements his surroundings, and vice-versa \u2014 when he\u2019s introduced, he\u2019s part of the landscape. He\u2019s a central part of the story, not just because he\u2019s important to the narrative, but because he feels like he belongs there. del Toro goes on to say that when he creates a character, he has to make sure that the character\u2019s design, wardrobe, production design, and color and lighting all work together to bring that character to life. But good design is only part of the story: the performance of actor Doug Jones \u2014 who has played many of the fantastical creatures in del Toro\u2019s films \u2014 is also critical. Williams notes that while he\u2019s covered under prosthetics \u2014 and some visual effects \u2014 those features augment Jones\u2019 performance in any given film, bringing a new level of believability to the character. All of that comes together to produce movie monsters that \u201cfeel alive\u201d \u2014 not just for the performers acting out the scene, but for the audience as well. \u201cTheir significance is in more than just their presence \u2014it\u2019s what they represent\u201d in the story, something that del Toro describes as \u201ceye protein,\u201d rather than \u201ceye candy.\u201d\n    Related\n  Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
