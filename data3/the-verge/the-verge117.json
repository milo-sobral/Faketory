{"id": "This might be Google\u2019s budget Pixel, complete with headphone jack", "paragraph": "Surely you remember the fateful week when Google\u2019s big day was spoiled \u2014 when Russian bloggers revealed the Pixel 3 phone to the world in all its glorious detail? We still don\u2019t know how, exactly, a batch of phones fell into their hands, but it may have just happened again: Russian tech blog Rozetked claims that you\u2019re looking at the first images of the \u201cPixel 3 Lite.\u201dAnd unless our eyes deceive us, this phone comes with a bona fide headphone jack. According to the publication, this Pixel 3 Lite has a 5.56-inch, 2220 x 1080-pixel IPS display, a plastic case, and a Snapdragon 670 processor, all of which would make it a cheaper Pixel but probably not a smaller one. The existing Pixel 3 has a 5.5-inch screen, too \u2014 but Google\u2019s unprecedentedly expensive $800 flagship has a more expensive OLED panel that\u2019s nearly on par with the screens in Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9 and the iPhone XS, according to Dieter\u2019s Pixel 3 review.There are reasons to take this leak with a grain of salt, though, even though Rozetked was the first publication to bring us a blowout of the Pixel 3 XL, and even though a cheaper Pixel has long been rumored to be in development.First off, it\u2019s bugging me that the logo on the back of the phone looks wrong. It\u2019s supposed to be a G, not a C, as those previous images of the leaked Pixel 3 XL clearly showed. I\u2019ve also got to wonder whether it makes strategic sense for Google \u2014 would it want to start yet another round of blowback about missing headphone jacks, after first mocking Apple for dropping them and then getting roundly thumped for ditching the jack themselves in the Pixel 2? Also, don\u2019t forget that none other than Google head of hardware Rick Osterloh was the one to quash those first rumors of a cheaper Pixel in March 2017, with the words \u201cPixel stays premium.\u201dCompanies and people can change their minds, of course. And the apparent codename of this phone, Sargo, did appear buried in the code for Google\u2019s ARCore app a while back. (You can thank Android Police for that tidbit.) But we need more evidence.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
