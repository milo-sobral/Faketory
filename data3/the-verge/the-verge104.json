{"id": "Unagi is the $1,190 electric scooter you won\u2019t want to share with anyone", "paragraph": "If you\u2019re tired of those janky dockless electric scooters and ready for an upgrade, a new startup based in Oakland, California may have what you\u2019re looking for. Unagi is the Japanese word for freshwater eel, but now it is also a stylish electric scooter for the luxury set. Electric scooters are fast becoming a convenient and fun way to commute for city folks. But not everyone lives in a city with dockless, shareable scooters like Bird and Lime. David Hyman, the former Beats Music CEO and co-founder of music startup MOG, says he was inspired to launch Unagi after finding the scooter-sharing services to be kind of a \u201cdrag.\u201d Many of the scooters are broken, and they could be hard to find when you need them the most, Hyman said. \u201cThe real breaking point was a year ago, taking one to Whole Foods to buy groceries and coming outside to find someone took my scooter,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI had just bought a $7 pint of Jenny\u2019s ice cream and it was 75 degrees outside. I walked to the closest scooters based on their apps showing them to me on a map, and as i approached (1/4-1/2 mile away), someone jumped on and rode away. I walked home with melted ice cream and decided at that point, I needed to own one.\u201dFirst introduced in China as Swan, the scooter company rebranded as Unagi for its US release. Hyman traveled to China where he toured several scooter factories and was most impressed by the team at Qingmai Company working on Swan. He convinced three of the company\u2019s industrial designers to form Unagi for the purpose of releasing the scooter in the US. \u201cWe spent six months massively improving on the legacy design,\u201d he said. \u201cNew motors, new braking mechanism, new lighting, new display, and most importantly, rebuilt from the ground up controller from the drone world that\u2019s bullet-proof.\u201d\u201cThe Swan was the 1.0 and the Unagi is the 2.0,\u201d Hyman added, \u201cand going forward it\u2019s all Unagi.\u201d The company launched its own Kickstarter last week, and has already reached his goal in raising over $100,000. Hyman said he hopes to begin shipping scooters in January. The Unagi scooter cuts an attractive profile. The handlebars are magnesium, the stem is Japanese carbon fiber, and the deck is machined aluminum with embedded silicon. The price tag, though, differs wildly from the original price for the Swan scooter in China. Unagi comes in a couple of different models \u2014 a 250 watt for $890 and a 450 watt for $1,190. Compare that to popular brands available on Amazon, like Xiaomi Mi for $599, or Segway-Ninebot for $777. According to Electrek, Swan is currently available in China for\uffe52,499 (~$384). Both of the models have three riding modes: beginner (9.3 mph max speed), intermediate (12.4 mph max speed), and advanced (15.5 mph max speed). A digital display between the handlebars indicates what mode you\u2019re in, how fast you\u2019re going, and how much battery life you have left. I got a chance to test the Unagi a few days last week. I live in New York City, so my experience with electric scooters is pretty minimal; the scooters are still technically illegal under state law, but I\u2019m seeing more people riding them every day. And the big scooter-sharing companies like Bird and Lime are actively lobbying city officials to lift the ban. That said, New York is an extremely inhospitable place for electric scooters. Riding on the ancient, pockmarked streets of lower Manhattan, there were several times I felt I would fall into a pothole and never emerge. The Unagi\u2019s tires and shocks are fairly solid, but I would recommend sticking to more recently paved roads when riding one. With wheels measuring just 7.5-inches in diameter, you still end up feeling every bump and crack in the road.Hyman said his scooters can get the job done. \u201cI\u2019m from NYC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe roads there are no worse than the roads here in Oakland I think.\u201dTwo paddles control the acceleration and brakes. The scooter\u2019s braking distance on a dry road is about 13 feet. When I was testing it, the roads were a little slick after a rain, so the distance may have been slightly further. The brakes are completely electronic, unlike some other scooters that also include manual hand brakes or disc brakes. I found the Unagi\u2019s brake to be a little jerky in advanced mode, even though the company says it aims to bring the scooter to \u201ca safe, steady stop.\u201dUnagi claims its patented stainless steel hinge system is one of a kind. Of course, other electric scooters fold in half, too, but Unagi\u2019s works very well. I brought the folded scooter onto the subway, and was able to get through the turnstiles with no fuss. It wasn\u2019t the lightest scooter I\u2019ve ever handled, but at 24.48 lbs, it wasn\u2019t particularly heavy either. Unagi has a number of other helpful features, like a headlight with adjustable brightness, and a rear tail light. The lithium ion battery is built into the platform, takes about four to five hours to fully charge, and has a range of over 15 miles. Of course, purchasing items through Kickstarter can be risky, so you may want to wait and see what happens with Unagi before making a decision. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something unique that, in its current state, is not ready for outside investment and may never be,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring something beautiful to people from our own passion for it, regardless of whether it checks off the VC\u2019s boxes.\u201dElectric rideables \u2014 bikes, scooters, skateboards \u2014 are growing increasingly popular, so it makes sense we\u2019d begin to see more premium models like Unagi. But Hyman said it was important to offer his scooters at a price competitive with top-end electric bikes and scooters on the market. \u201cThere [have] been plenty of electric bike shares but their popularity has paled in comparison to scooters,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also something inviting about just jumping on a scooter that feels much less cumbersome. And you don\u2019t mess up your clothes either.\u201dCommand Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
