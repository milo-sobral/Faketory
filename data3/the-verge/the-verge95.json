{"id": "An academic reported sexual harassment. Her university allegedly retaliated", "paragraph": "Lara Carlson remembers November 20th, 2012, as a pivotal moment in a bruising conflict with her employer, the University of New England. On that day, Carlson entered a meeting with the university\u2019s human resources department to discuss troubling problems she\u2019d had over the past year. She\u2019d received what she considered to be lewd emails from her boss, Paul Visich, the chair of the Exercise and Sport Performance department. She alleged that he made unwanted, sexually charged remarks as well as unwanted physical contact. Visich was her direct supervisor \u2014 he wrote up her teaching evaluations and merit raises and oversaw the direction of her curriculum \u2014 and was, until his recusal, the head of the committee that decided whether Carlson, 50, received tenure. So Carlson complained to Sharen Beaulieu, a human resources director at the university, as well as Timothy Ford, the interim dean of UNE\u2019s Westbrook College of Health Professions. Carlson printed out the emails from Visich and put them in a binder. Ford and Beaulieu, Carlson says, acknowledged Visich\u2019s actions were sexual harassment. Beaulieu told Carlson that she had to meet with Visich. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Carlson says, adding that she was fearful that Visich would brush off her complaints or seek to damage her career. \u201cI was scared. I was scared to death.\u201d Beaulieu was the first to speak at the November 20th meeting, and she said Visich had called the meeting. \u201cYou and I talked, Paul,\u201d the administrator said, \u201cand you said you thought it would be good for us to get together.\u201dCarlson felt blindsided. She had complained, yet Visich\u2019s concerns, in her view, dominated the meeting. \u201cI was shocked, and I felt betrayed,\u201d she tells The Verge. Carlson recorded the meeting.Her tape recorded Beaulieu telling Carlson that Visich \u201cis your chair so we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to make this work.\u201d The HR director urged Carlson to improve her communication with Visich. A second binder of emails \u2014 evidence of Carlson\u2019s harassment allegations \u2014 that Carlson brought in case the first she gave to Beaulieu was not used remained on the table, unopened. \u201cIt was clear that no matter what, UNE was going to keep Visich as my chair,\u201d Carlson says.\u201cI know there\u2019s times when we\u2019ve had issues and you\u2019ve tried to stay as far away as possible from me and I\u2019ve had to go hunt you down,\u201d Visich said in the recording. \u201cBeing part of the team is important. And you have kind of set yourself apart from all of us... You have created some animosities with the faculty.\u201d Carlson pushed the binder across the table toward Visich. He refused even to glance downward, she says. After an hour and a half, Carlson left to give a lecture. The next Monday, Carlson emailed Beaulieu to ask about Visich\u2019s harassing emails. \u201cI addressed his interactions with you and inappropriate emails immediately after you left for your class,\u201d the HR director replied. Visich, in a September 7th, 2016, deposition, told attorneys he called for the meeting, but he did not recall discussing these emails with HR.Less than three years after the meeting, Carlson, no longer a part of the Exercise and Sport Performance department, would be embroiled in a legal battle against the university for retaliating against her after she raised sexual harassment complaints. The reporting that follows tells Carlson\u2019s story based on court documents and interviews with Carlson and her colleagues. The fallout from the events at UNE, including that meeting, upended her once-promising career.After Carlson filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in Maine, the university asked the court to dismiss the claim. \u201cUNE exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any discriminatory, harassing or retaliatory behavior,\u201d wrote the university\u2019s attorneys in the answer to Carlson\u2019s complaint. She had \u201cunreasonably failed to take advantage of the corrective opportunities provided by UNE or otherwise failed to avoid harm.\u201dBetween 60 and 80 percent of women in the workplace experience some form of sexual harassment. Carlson\u2019s story \u201cis the sort of thing that I\u2019ve heard quite a bit over the years,\u201d says Kathryn Clancy, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Clancy is an author of a recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, published in June, that describes the pervasiveness of sexual and gender harassment in science in academic settings. More than 50 percent of female faculty members have experienced harassment, mostly sexist comments and inappropriate jokes.The story Carlson tells is a story of sexual harassment. But it is also a story of institutional failure. \u201cMale domination and organizational tolerance toward harassment are the two main underlying factors that often create more harassment,\u201d Clancy says.  A series of allegations have rocked the academic astronomy community since BuzzFeed News revealed in 2015 that a prominent exoplanet researcher violated the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s sexual harassment policies. A 2016 investigation by The Verge found that mammalogist Miguel Pinto harassed fellow research students at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Pinto was banned from the museum\u2019s labs. The #MeToo movement that went viral in October 2017 pulled the most egregious examples of sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront of public consciousness. But what still lurks outside of the headlines and news chyrons are the more common, yet still professionally destructive, forms of abuse.The focus on explicit misconduct misses the vast majority of harassment. Demeaning jokes, unwanted sexual attention, and excluding women from decision-making processes and leadership positions all cause detrimental effects on women\u2019s health, productivity, and long-term career goals.\u201cThis isn\u2019t some kind of Harvey Weinstein-type of story in terms of the seeming severity of the behaviors of the perpetrator,\u201d Clancy says. \u201cAt the same time, the personal and professional consequences are really obvious.\u201d A decade ago, Carlson was a rising star in the field of exercise physiology. Before becoming a scientist, she was an athlete who competed in the hammer throw at four USA Track and Field national championships. An injury cut her athletic career short. \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to hardship,\u201d she says. She found success in academia. In 2009, Carlson left her job at Vermont\u2019s Castleton State College, now known as Castleton University, for a tenure-track position at the private University of New England in Biddeford, Maine. The university recruited Carlson not only for her physiology expertise, but also for her reputation as a teacher. \u201cShe had a phenomenal teaching record,\u201d says Amy Davidoff, a University of New England professor of pharmacology who describes herself as \u201can advocate and a mentor\u201d for Carlson. During her time at UNE, Carlson was nominated for the university\u2019s Westbrook College of Health Professions\u2019 Distinguished Teaching award, and she won UNE\u2019s Excellence in Academic Advising award. Students adored her. One of Carlson\u2019s former students, who requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions, described \u201cDoc. C\u201d as \u201ceasily the best professor\u201d at the university. Carlson had scientific chops, too. She was twice elected as president of the New England American College of Sports Medicine (NEACSM), and she founded UNE\u2019s first NEACSM College Bowl team. In her first few years at the University of New England, Carlson led an investigation into the physiology of stock car drivers. Studying male NASCAR competitors, Carlson discovered that significant heat strain causes drivers\u2019 skin temperatures to rise and their bodies to lose weight through sweat. In 2013, The New York Times described her studies as \u201cnew research that supports racing\u2019s athletic cred.\u201d The university commissioned a short documentary of her work, which the New England chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Science nominated for an Emmy. In the university\u2019s eyes, \u201cI was a superstar,\u201d Carlson says. That is, until she complained about Visich. The University of New England hired Visich, who had researched the genetics of muscle size among other areas of study, from Central Michigan University to become chair of the Exercise and Sport Performance (ESP) department in 2011. UNE faculty were impressed by Visich\u2019s resume and his ability to secure grant money from the National Institutes of Health.But Visich began to act unprofessionally shortly after his arrival as the new department head, Carlson says. In a January 20th, 2012, email exchange, he wrote: \u201cI am home in my PJs sipping tea and watching porn!\u201dVisich, who did not respond to four requests for comment by email and phone, has described these emails as banter among friends. Carlson and her husband were the \u201cfirst good friends\u201d Visich and his wife made in Maine, he said. \u201cOf course, I was not watching porn. I was simply joking with her,\u201d he said in the September 2016 deposition. \u201cWe had a joking relationship with each other during these times.\u201d In February 2012, Visich sent a picture of a female baboon\u2019s engorged genitals to Carlson. \u201cHey just wanted to let you know that I\u2019ve got the itches BAD today,\u201d his email read. \u201cSeriously my ass feels like this.\u201d Other messages referenced Lara\u2019s husband: \u201cI hope the old man is giving you a nice rub down with some old oil he found in the garage, haha!\u201d and \u201cBlair told me he was shopping the other day and got you some real sexy panties, what a man! He was probably trying them on, haha!\u201dHe wrote these emails \u201cjokingly,\u201d he said in 2016, and \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily think they were considered sexual.\u201d During meetings, Carlson says, Visich sat next to her and placed his hands on her thighs and knees in an unwelcome manner and stared at her chest. He stopped her once, while the department was moving into its new facility at the Alfond Forum, by grabbing her upper arm and holding her so forcefully that she asked him to let go. Carlson began to avoid one-on-one meetings with Visich. \u201cI started to distance myself from him,\u201d she says.Visich targeted students, too, Carlson says. In May 2012, as part of a physiology class, Carlson and Visich decided to take students on a trip up Quandary Peak, a Colorado mountain. Carlson recalls that for months prior, Visich, during guest lectures in Carlson\u2019s class, told female undergraduates to prepare by packing colorful bras.A student complained about Visich\u2019s repeated references to wearing colorful bras on the trip to a staff member in the department. That staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions, confirmed this incident with The Verge. On the trip, Carlson stayed at the base with a combination of altitude sickness and a stomach bug. At the top, Visich insisted on taking a picture where, despite the altitude and snow, the men stripped to the waist, and the women wore bright sports bras. Visich is in the picture as well, grinning as he flexes his biceps. Visich continued to take shirtless photos with undergraduate students as recently as 2016, according to a longtime faculty member and associate professor at the university, who wished to be unnamed for fear of retaliation. Two students complained to this professor. One of those students shared the photos, which Visich had posted to social media, with the faculty member. \u201cBefore I even met Lara,\u201d the professor says, \u201cI heard from students who were in his classes how uncomfortable it made them.\u201dCarlson formally raised her complaints to Ford and Beaulieu in the fall of 2012, explaining that Visich \u201cwas touching me in an unwelcome way, leering at my chest.\u201d The November 20th meeting with Visich came from those complaints, but things soon spun far from resolution. Visich began to retaliate against her for complaining, Carlson says. In early June 2013, he wrote a negative evaluation about Carlson, saying her \u201cinvolvement with the department this year has been fairly minimal.\u201d Visich was removed as the head of Carlson\u2019s tenure committee in the fall, but he remained her direct supervisor. Visich removed Carlson as the head of UNE\u2019s College Bowl team. He created more stringent procedures for allowing non-Exercise and Sport Performance majors to take Carlson\u2019s class; consequently, several students were denied enrollment. The next spring, without prior discussions with Carlson, he nixed the lab time allotted for her exercise physiology course, which prevented her from implementing labs she was still required to teach. The meeting also didn\u2019t stop Visich\u2019s unwanted touching. On September 5th, 2013, Carlson was sitting on her motorcycle in a school parking lot, talking with a student, when Visich approached, reached out, and began to rub her shoulders. The student who was present described the behavior to The Verge as \u201ccreepy\u201d and says that Carlson appeared \u201cweirdly uncomfortable.\u201d Visich, in the deposition, said he was consoling Carlson after the death of a colleague. \u201cCould I have touched her back? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWas it sexual in nature? No way.\u201dThe student submitted a witness statement, Beaulieu reviewed the incident when Carlson complained, and she concluded that no sexual harassment had occurred. Afterward, the student says, he was blackballed from applying for a job in the department.The federal civil rights law known as Title IX has become a major force through which victims of sexual harassment at universities \u2014 both students and faculty \u2014 raise their complaints. Title IX is cheaper than a lawsuit (it\u2019s free), and federal oversight compels universities to act aggressively. Celene Reynolds, a sociologist at Yale University, has studied Title IX mobilization over the last several decades. She found that gender discrimination complaints under this law have risen continuously since 2006, with an \u201cexplosion\u201d in complaints after 2009. In 2014, 1,446 Title IX complaints were filed.But while more people are coming forward, Title IX does not necessarily prevent or prosecute sexual harassment, nor does Title IX always provide victims with the assistance they need. Betsy DeVos, secretary of education in the Trump administration, has spent much of her term dismantling Obama-era guidelines meant to empower victims of sexual misconduct on campus, arguing the moves are to ensure the accused are not wrongfully disenfranchised. Moreover, these laws are frequently misunderstood. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand why sexual harassment \u2014 and sexual violence as an extreme form of sexual harassment \u2014 is a civil rights violation, a violation of the victim\u2019s rights to an equal education or equal employment opportunity,\u201d says Nancy Cantalupo, a lawyer who has written extensively about gender discrimination in universities and colleges. \u201cBut that\u2019s how civil rights laws define it.\u201dSchools mistakenly approach violations to Title IX and Title VII (which bans discrimination in any workplace) from the perspective of criminal law, rather than civil rights law. Administrators may focus on punishment, not reestablishing the civil rights of the victim. Therefore, if universities believe they cannot find evidence they deem punishment-worthy, victims are virtually ignored.\u201cIf you\u2019re focused on a punitive response, you\u2019re not really thinking about what the civil rights law requires of you,\u201d says Cantalupo. That\u2019s not the only problem. Universities, in particular, don\u2019t allocate many funds to human resources and Title IX offices, says Clancy. \u201cThat makes it really easy for retaliation and other things to happen,\u201d she says. And she\u2019d know: Clancy, in an influential 2014 survey of 658 researchers who conduct field work, found that 61 percent were victims of harassment, including inappropriate or sexual remarks. Twenty percent reported they were sexually assaulted. Few of the subjects in the study understood how to report such incidents, and most who did were unhappy with the official outcome.The federal government is only making the process more difficult for victims. Under DeVos, the Department of Education wants to pivot the standard for evidence under Title IX cases toward a criminal standard, from a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d (the allegations are more likely than not true) to a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, which would make it harder for victims to prove discrimination on campus.As Carlson felt the retaliation progress, she found her ability to do research being systematically dismantled, beginning in 2014. First, she was removed as an undergraduate student adviser. Then, Carlson asked the new dean and Ford\u2019s successor, Elizabeth Francis-Connolly, for a new supervisor, and she was rebuffed. The dean felt this \u201cwould create a significant conflict and would usurp the authority of the leadership of ESP,\u201d according to court documents. Instead, she offered to move Carlson from the ESP department to a different college.Here\u2019s where everything for Carlson began to crumble. Reluctant to transfer, she finally agreed after a series of conversations with Francis-Connolly, which led Carlson to believe that she would continue to teach her courses and conduct research. The transfer, Carlson told Francis-Connolly, \u201ccould resolve the situation\u201d if it \u201ccan be accomplished along the lines we discussed.\u201d The university, in court proceedings, emphasized that Carlson had \u201cfreely agreed to\u201d the transfer.After receiving tenure in March 2014, Carlson left the department in April 2015 and was assigned to the Portland, Maine campus. But she was unable to teach exercise physiology \u2014 a popular class for which she\u2019d designed the curriculum \u2014 or environmental physiology. She only found out about these changes when the published course catalog listed the instructor for those courses as \u201cTBD.\u201d Carlson asked Francis-Connolly to cross-list environmental physiology to the Biology Department so she could teach it, but she says that Visich convinced Francis-Connolly to reject that move. The university maintains that it did not cross-list the course because Carlson failed to follow proper protocol for submitting her request.Eventually, Carlson\u2019s profile was removed from the ESP department\u2019s website at Visich\u2019s behest in July 2015, which, she says, led external funders to stop contacting her. For the 2016 academic year, she received a merit raise of 2 percent \u2014 the smallest raise she says she had ever received during her time at UNE. In 2016, she was placed in the university\u2019s Department of Physical Therapy, despite not being a licensed physical therapist, excluding her from participating in department decisions and curriculum changes. It\u2019s been years since she collected data for her own research.\u201cI just felt dehumanized, devalued and literally discarded,\u201d she says.The behavior Carlson describes is typical of the kind of sexism, misconduct, and lack of accountability that university settings can foster. Such actions \u201cdon\u2019t quite meet, say, the definition for things like sexual coercion,\u201d Clancy says, though they \u201care just below that threshold.\u201dClancy\u2019s assessment of the situation was unambiguous: there should have been a thorough investigation, and if the allegations were true, then Visich should have been removed as head of the ESP department. It\u2019s important to call out less shocking but still inappropriate behavior, says Heidi Lockwood, a philosophy professor at Southern Connecticut State University who advocates for survivors of sexual harassment at universities. \u201cWe need to get away from evaluations of how much harm specific individuals experience, and focus on the pure wrongness of the act.\u201dThis sort of harassment can have the worst personal consequences, Clancy says, because victims may internalize it. The organization that\u2019s supposed to address grievances is instead closing ranks around the perpetrator \u201cand further gaslighting the victim.\u201d With institutions choosing to side with perpetrators over victims, it\u2019s no wonder so many women are effectively being harassed out of the sciences.Paul Lannon, an attorney at the law firm Holland & Knight in Boston specializing in employment and labor, points out that academic culture, as opposed to the commercial sector, is imbued with an overt layer of free expression. \u201cAcademic freedom for a faculty member gives them the freedom to discuss ideas, present ideas in the classroom, write about ideas, in ways that can be controversial, or out of the mainstream, or provocative,\u201d Lannon says. \u201cThat freedom sometimes, I think, can be misconstrued as license to behave in a way that would violate the laws against sexual harassment or discrimination.\u201d If male academics are celebrated for their controversial or provocative ideas, it\u2019s not hard to see why they might believe it\u2019s okay to act controversially or provocatively in the workplace. There\u2019s little wonder why academia has a sexual harassment problem: once these sorts of men find themselves in positions of power with the job security tenure provides, they have little reason to fear the consequences when their \u201cprovocative\u201d attitudes augur into inappropriate, demeaning conduct against others.  Lannon, who has served as outside counsel for several universities in harassment lawsuits, says that the revocation of tenure is a very lengthy and disruptive process that both colleges and the accused must agree to. In cases where the accused are forced out, they often opt for a voluntary resignation to avoid a long, public conflict. \u201cIt may not look like they were fired from the outside, but it was the consequence of findings made during an investigation,\u201d he says. But since those findings rarely become public, aggressors tend to simply move on to other positions at other schools where they can enjoy a clean reputation and even begin their harassment anew. Carlson did not take legal action against the university until the school removed her from courses in the Physiology Department. \u201cWhen I learned that they were not going to give me my job back \u2014 my classes, that I loved so passionately to teach, the reason I came to the University of New England \u2014 that\u2019s when we decided to move forward,\u201d she says.On November 4th, 2014, attorneys David Kreisler and Christopher Harmon filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint on Carlson\u2019s behalf. She filed a lawsuit against the university on January 4th, 2016, for retaliation. Maine District Court judge Jon D. Levy ruled that Carlson failed to show the university retaliated against her. The crux of his argument was built around Carlson\u2019s decision to leave the department. The \u201cevidence is undisputed that Carlson participated in the decision for her to transfer out of the ESP Department, and that the transfer was voluntary,\u201d the ruling states. The \u201cfact that the choice given to Carlson was a difficult one, and possibly ill-advised in light of the harassing conduct she alleged Visich committed, does not render the transfer retaliatory.\u201d Carlson, Levy wrote, was unable to suggest \u201cthat the real motive behind UNE\u2019s actions was unlawful discrimination in retaliation for her harassment complaints.\u201d Because sexual misconduct and retaliation are civil rights cases, \u201cplaintiffs have to show not merely that the alleged conduct happened, but also that it in some way impeded their access to civil rights guaranteed under Title VII or Title IX,\u201d Lockwood says. Levy\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t dispute that Visich sexually harassed Carlson, but it does deny that her civil rights were violated since she still had a \u201cchoice\u201d in responding to what happened to her. Carlson immediately appealed the ruling. Levy\u2019s ruling is wildly different from how we interpret other acts of aggression, Lockwood says. \u201cWhen someone steals your wallet, no one wants to know how upset you were about the theft, and you don\u2019t need to provide proof of the hardship. No one asks, \u2018Are you sure you really had a wallet, and are you sure you didn\u2019t just lose it?\u2019 or \u2018Did your work performance decrease after your wallet was stolen, and did you seek counseling?\u2019 No one demands proof that the victim didn\u2019t \u2018encourage\u2019 the theft by, say, leaving the wallet in an unlocked car. It\u2019s understood that no reasonable person would want to have a wallet stolen.\u201dWhat happened to Carlson is a perfect example of what Lockwood likes to call the \u201cGoldilocks problem.\u201d If your story sounds profoundly heinous, the courts think you\u2019re lying. If it doesn\u2019t sound severe enough, the courts won\u2019t find your case convincing. Your story has to have the right amount of wrongdoing. That burden of proof, Lockwood says, is a symptom of how our culture assumes victims \u2014 women \u2014 might actually enjoy sexual harassment and the implicit trade of sexual favors for perks and benefits.Carlson almost gave up as the lawsuit stalled. \u201cYou start losing hope,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the type of person if I have hope I can keep going.\u201d She lost friends. \u201cYou learn real quick who\u2019s there for you and who isn\u2019t.\u201d Anyone who wonders why more victims of harassment don\u2019t come forward hasn\u2019t thought about \u201cthe guilt, the shame and the re-traumatizing over and over and over again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible process.\u201dNevertheless, Carlson appealed. In August, the First Circuit Court in Boston reversed the district court\u2019s initial judgment and sent the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings, noting that \u201cCarlson has demonstrated that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether UNE misled Carlson into transferring departments.\u201d Carlson\u2019s employment, the court found, may well have been adversely affected by her inability to teach her previous courses, advise ESP students, and by her disappearance from the ESP department website. And Francis-Connolly\u2019s \u201cshifting justifications\u201d seemed to indicate these moves may not have been made in good faith. \u201cA jury could find that Carlson would not have accepted the transfer but for Dean Francis-Connolly\u2019s misrepresentations,\u201d the court stated. \u201cA jury could also reasonably infer that Dean Francis-Connolly did so in retaliation against Carlson. A reasonable jury could also find that these events would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 Carlson\u2019s activity in reporting Visich\u2019s sexual harassment of her.\u201d During those proceedings, UNE maintained that Carlson was not misled into accepting an undesirable transfer or even that staying in the ESP department would have constituted an adverse employment action. Its lawyers argued that the removal of her biography from the department website, her removal of her advisees, and changes to her course assignments were simply a consequence of her transfer \u201ccaused by Carlson\u2019s request to have distance from Visich and her choice to transfer out of the Department, not as the result of her complaints of sexual harassment.\u201dThe university declined to comment beyond a brief statement. \u201cThe university does not comment on ongoing litigation or on personnel matters,\u201d Sarah Delage, UNE\u2019s director of public relations, said in the statement. \u201cWe have robust programs in place to prevent sexual harassment on campus and in the workplace, and provide a range of related educational programming to students, faculty and professional staff throughout the year. We respond to all allegations of sexual harassment and investigate those accusations appropriately and conscientiously, and take appropriate action when the investigation indicates it is warranted.\u201dUNE president James Herbert assumed office on July 1st, 2017; four months later, he released a campus-wide letter about sexual harassment. \u201cIf you believe you have experienced harassment or assault, I urge you to come forward,\u201d he wrote. Carlson, who has never met Herbert, sent him a letter on November 16th, 2017. \u201cIn my view, Paul Visich still poses a significant risk to others at the UNE,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUNE\u2019s current policies allow him to continue in his unchecked behavior.\u201d If Herbert received her warning, he did not respond, Carlson says.In February 2018, Lockwood spoke with Herbert for an hour. Lockwood recalls that she told Herbert that students in the ESP department \u201care worried about Visich\u2019s behavior.\u201d His initial response to Lockwood, she says, was \u201cessentially, \u2018I\u2019m really concerned, I had no idea that there were any problems in that department.\u2019\u201d As the conversation continued, \u201cat one point he said there was one case involving a faculty member and a romance gone bad. And she was an \u2018angry employee,\u2019\u201d Lockwood tells The Verge. That case, Herbert told Lockwood, had been settled. Lockwood followed up in a June email to Herbert, concerned about unanswered questions from their conversation. She asked him whether the bad romance and \u201cangry employee\u201d referred to Carlson or someone else. Herbert did not reply to Lockwood. The Verge\u2019s requests for comment to the president\u2019s office have gone unanswered.In all of her interviews with victims over the years, Clancy says, she\u2019s noticed a common refrain. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve been really struck by is how many of them say, \u2018I just want to get back to work.\u2019\u201dCarlson is no exception. She wants to teach the subject she knows. She wants to collect new data. She wants to mentor students. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been fighting for,\u201d she says, \u201cis to do my job.\u201d She wants to return to the department she still calls \u201chome.\u201d"}
