{"id": "Netflix has canceled Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage", "paragraph": "Just a week after it announced that Iron Fist wouldn\u2019t return for a third season, Marvel has revealed that another of its Netflix shows won\u2019t continue: Luke Cage. The series aired its second season earlier this summer. Marvel and Netflix confirmed to Deadline that the show \u201cwill not return for a third season.\u201d The cancelation comes as a surprise, as it was widely expected to be renewed for an additional season. Unlike Iron Fist, which Marvel indicated might continue on in some form, this reads as a definitive end for the series. It\u2019s a shame, because Luke Cage has consistently been held up as one of the better shows in the franchise, while Iron Fist was widely panned. In the case of Iron Fist, Deadline speculated that the series might migrate over to Disney\u2019s forthcoming streaming service alongside planned shows about Loki and the Scarlet Witch. That goodwill doesn\u2019t appear to be there for Luke Cage. Deadline pointed to Marvel and Netflix\u2019s concrete efforts to develop a third season \u2014 they stood up a writer\u2019s room for a third season earlier this year \u2014 which were stymied by \u201crising tensions in the past month,\u201d over \u201ccreative differences\u201d between Marvel and Netflix over the scripts that have been developed. That Netflix and Marvel appear to be pulling back from their partnership doesn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise. Disney, after all, is developing its own streaming service to rival Netflix, and is presently building out its own catalog of original content. Disney announced that it would end its distribution deal with Netflix last year, and while Netflix worked to try and retain the rights to the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, it seems that those properties will eventually migrate over to Disney\u2019s platform. But that won\u2019t happen overnight: the streaming service just launched the third season of Daredevil (it remains to be seen whether or not there\u2019ll be a fourth season of the inaugural series), while Jessica Jones and The Punisher have each been renewed for a third and second season, respectively. At the very least, that leaves Netflix with at least some of the interconnected superhero universe for 2019. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
