Grim Fandango was one of the last games from the acclaimed studio LucasArts, and its clever blend of noir pastiche and folklore has earned it acclaim since the very beginning, when GameSpot praised its \u201cgreat writing and beautiful art direction.\u201dThere\u2019s a less-than-proud tradition of artists ripping off surface-level D\u00eda de Muertos imagery, an issue game director Tim Schafer has discussed: \u201cI knew I was appropriating someone else\u2019s culture, so the idea was to be as authentic as possible and do as much research as possible,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015. But Grim Fandango is a distinctive piece of art, full of puzzles that have (mostly) held up well. It was released on the Nintendo Switch just this week \u2014 and if you decide to play it, here are five other stories to check out while it\u2019s downloading.As a person who covers day-to-day technology news, I often wonder how my writing might come off to someone in the future \u2014 and whether anyone will even be reading it. I can\u2019t answer those questions, but I can do the next best thing: look back at what other people were writing 20 years ago.Here are five stories \u2014 big and small \u2014 that science and tech enthusiasts might have checked out in the week before November 3rd, 1998.What do Intel, The X-Files, and The Simpsons have in common? All three became iconic in the \u201890s, and all three were featured in this Adweek article about \u201cHomer\u2019s Smart Brain,\u201d a commercial in which Homer Simpson has his brain replaced \u2014 or at least, supplemented \u2014 with an Intel Pentium II processor. The ad aired during the X-Files\u2019 sixth season premiere, and it was designed to \u201ceducate [Intel\u2019s] consumer audience about what role the processor plays in their PC and the value of it.\u201dFor what it\u2019s worth, the 2nd Generation Pentium II processor topped out around 450MHz, and the 2018 Intel Pentium Gold G5600 (one of the company\u2019s cheaper processors) runs at 3.90GHz. So if a Pentium II could turn Homer from a bumbling schlub to a college professor in two weeks, a modern Intel chip would have to make him some kind of god.Did you know you can play video games... against other humans... on the internet? It\u2019s the year 2018, where every celebrity has an e-sports team, so the answer is probably \u201cyes.\u201d But The New York Times was on this trend 20 years ago, when the state of the art was games like Bungie\u2019s Myth: The Fallen Lords or Origin\u2019s Ultima Online. \u201cThe novelty is that you are not playing yourself in a dark corner of a room somewhere, but you are interacting with actual people,\u201d explained Myth player Daniel Shiffman, who is now a professor at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts.The Times article is a worthwhile look back at the state of \u201890s internet gaming, which grew symbiotically with portals like AOL. As a companion piece chronicles, however, navigating web and gaming portals was every bit as miserable as dealing with modern video game DRM and service updates \u2014 and you had to do it over a dial-up modem.But you didn\u2019t need a fancy modem to play one of the year\u2019s oddest games: Apocalypse, a third-person shooter / platformer about Bruce Willis averting the apocalypse. Willis originally lent his voice (and face) to an AI sidekick, but after Apocalypse fell into development hell, studio Neversoft salvaged it by making him the protagonist \u2014 albeit one who constantly quips to an invisible partner, since the dialog was apparently already recorded. GamePro enthusiastically previewed the game in its October 1998 issue, and on October 30th, it was given a holiday launch date. IGN ultimately declared the final product \u201ca lot of fun, and ... entirely engaging for a few hours or so.\u201dAs a Eurogamer feature chronicles, Apocalypse\u2019s greatest legacy is actually the incredibly successful Tony Hawk series of skateboarding games, which Neversoft built on Apocalypse\u2019s game engine. In fact, the first prototypes reused Willis\u2019 character model \u2014 so as level designer Aaron Cammarata puts it, \u201cthe main character was literally Bruce Willis with a machine gun on a skateboard.\u201dIf you were more into music than video games, this was also a pretty good week. The Recording Industry Association of America had filed to stop production of the Diamond Rio, an early MP3 player that the RIAA claimed promoted piracy. In late October, however, a judge denied its request for a permanent injunction, allowing Diamond Multimedia Systems to ship the Rio in November. Diamond\u2019s legal luck continued, and in 1999, a US appeals court declared that MP3 players didn\u2019t violate unauthorized recording laws.The Rio only held 60 minutes of music, and like most early MP3 players, it couldn\u2019t stand up to Apple\u2019s iPod \u2014 the last Rios were produced in 2005. But its legal battle had established that consumers could copy music files from a computer to a music player. As Motherboard put it last year, it\u2019s arguably the MP3 player that made MP3 players possible, at least in the US.Finally, for book lovers, an MIT Technology Review story examined President Bill Clinton\u2019s fascination with The Cobra Event, a 1997 novel about a biological weapon that causes victims to cannibalize themselves. The novel (written by Richard Preston, better known for his nonfiction book The Hot Zone) reportedly alarmed Clinton so much that he immediately asked the FBI to investigate its plausibility. And in 1998, he proposed a $300 million budget line for fighting bioterrorism, including $51 million to stockpile vaccines.Technology Review author Stephen S. Hall was deeply skeptical of \u201cmerchants of fear\u201d who inflated the relatively small possibility of a deadly, large-scale bioterror attack. But after Clinton left office, bioterrorism became a far more pressing threat, in the wake of several anthrax attacks in 2001. To date, the worst American bioterrorism attack is still the Rajneesh cult\u2019s decidedly non-futuristic 1984 poisoning of a salad bar in Oregon \u2014 which was recounted in Netflix\u2019s documentary Wild Wild Country earlier this year.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
