The deals, which last through the week and end on Sunday, include Apple and Samsung products as well as jewelry and toys. eBay has selected dozens of items offered by rival retailers including Costco, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, Kohl\u2019s, and listed them on its site at slight discounts, often around $20 off. eBay is offering free shipping on all the deals, and if you spot a better deal on a competitor\u2019s website for an item you\u2019ve already purchased on eBay, you\u2019ll be able to ask for compensation. You\u2019ll just need to contact customer service within 48 hours after making a purchase on eBay to get a coupon of 110 percent of the difference.There are some daily deals staggered throughout the week, so no matter which day you start shopping on, some supplies will be left. And unlike last year, where eBay\u2019s deals were only available on the weekdays, the online platform has extended its early deals week by two days into the weekend. We\u2019ve picked out the highlights here and will keep updating this post with the latest deals.We\u2019ve tapped into the collective knowledge of The Verge to put together a list of 78 great gifts for all manner of ages, sizes, and budgets.
