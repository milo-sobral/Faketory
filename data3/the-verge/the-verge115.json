{"id": "The internet is celebrating Danny DeVito this week", "paragraph": "Sometimes, people can have really astounding weeks: they get engaged, promoted, and win their local karaoke competition all within a few days. Other times, they can have really terrible weeks: they go through a rough breakup, get fired, and are forced to listen to seven horrible rendition\u2019s of Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d at their local karaoke competition. Danny DeVito had a legendary week \u2014 on the internet, at least. DeVito, who has become best known in recent years for his portrayal of Frank Reynolds on It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, has long been a staple of internet culture. People adore DeVito and his strange character roles or commercials he stars in, but this week has seen an influx of strange DeVito stories celebrating the actor\u2019s life. DeVito\u2019s banner week began with the ambitious and strange Detective Pikachu trailer. The movie has little to do with DeVito. He isn\u2019t part of the film\u2019s cast or production team, but it\u2019s a role that DeVito and Pok\u00e9mon fans have been clamoring for ever since the film adaptation of Nintendo\u2019s popular game was first announced. Pikachu is instead voiced by Deadpool\u2019s Ryan Reynolds. For disappointed fans, this, of course, meant editing clips from the film\u2019s trailer to pay homage to DeVito \u2014 the one true Detective Pikachu. It didn\u2019t stop there. Even the team at Warner Bros. that\u2019s working on Detective Pikachu understands how important DeVito is to fans. The Twitter account, which launched earlier this week, followed a couple of prolific accounts of people who are involved in the film, Warner Bros.\u2019 main Twitter account, and it even threw DeVito a follow. DeVito hasn\u2019t responded to the outpouring of love and support by Pok\u00e9mon fans who are left devastated by his lack of presence in the film, but perhaps that\u2019s because he has more pressing online matters to attend to.The best Danny DeVito story of the week has to do with a creepy shrine created by college students at Purchase College in New York. Videos of the shrine, which was hidden behind a paper towel dispenser in a bathroom possibly located in the school\u2019s visual arts building, according to Mashable, appeared on Twitter on Sunday. The video, seen below, showcases the shrine set up in DeVito\u2019s honor. A handwritten note inside the shrine reads, \u201cLeave An Offering for Our Lord and Savior Danny DeVito, Patron Saint of Trash Men.\u201d The shrine went viral, circulating on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.Hole in a school bathroom that leads to a cavernous shrine to Danny devito pic.twitter.com/Xsdg22IxzLUnfortunately, not all attention is good, and some people will never appreciate good art. A few days later, a Facebook post confirmed that the entrance to the sacred shrine was sealed off once the school got wind of what students in the visual arts building were up to. It\u2019s unclear if the gifts left for DeVito were taken out before the shrine was closed, ostensibly forever. \u201cIt was good harmless fun for students for a long time,\u201d one student told Mashable. \u201cBut sadly, all of the attention made the administration aware of it and they took it away.\u201dThere is some good news, though: DeVito saw the news about the shrine and shared a special message with students, thanking them from the bottom of his heart full of garbage and adding one more entry into the Week of DeVito \u2014 it\u2019s his birthday tomorrow.Your shrine honors me. My heart is filled with love and garbage.Tomorrow, as you may know, is my name day. Do something that makes you feel good. Above all be kind to each other. Pick up trash, recycle, and be aware of plastics in the ocean. https://t.co/UER6uZY886Happy early birthday to Danny DeVito: the internet\u2019s favorite actor, the patron saint of trash men, and a consummate legend who will continue to inspire hundreds of bathroom shrines for years to come.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
