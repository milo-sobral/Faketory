{"id": "First Toy Story 4 teaser introduces the internet\u2019s newest hero, Forky", "paragraph": "Toy Story 4 is the continuation of one of Pixar\u2019s most beloved franchises, and the first teaser for the film introduces a new character who\u2019s caught some advance attention. Forky is an adorable, demented little spork outfitted with pipe-cleaner arms and a cute, squiggly face. It\u2019s the type of toy that could only be loved by a child who spent 20 whole minutes making it, and it\u2019s obvious from the teaser that he doesn\u2019t belong with the rest of Andy and Bonnie\u2019s precious toys. Even Forky admits it, frantically crying out that he isn\u2019t a toy \u2014 which feels like a callback to the first Toy Story\u2019s central plot, where Buzz Lightyear refused to believe he was a toy rather than a real-life astronaut. Whether Forky actually belongs with the group doesn\u2019t really matter to the people online who have become obsessed with the strange character.

Objectively, Forky is a spork. His name should be Sporky, but hopefully his confusing name will be addressed in the film. A synopsis of Toy Story 4 from Disney Pixar reads:Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that\u2019s Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called \u201cForky\u201d to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy.Toy Story 4 will be released in Summer 2019.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
