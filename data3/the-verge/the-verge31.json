{"id": "AT&T is beta testing an Android TV set-top box", "paragraph": "Faced with a declining traditional TV segment, AT&T is currently beta testing an Android TV-based device that\u2019s meant to be an easy way of getting DirecTV Now onto the TVs and in front of the eyes of more people. The small set-top box will be more widely available on a trial basis \u201cin the first half of next year,\u201d AT&T Communications CEO John Donovan said today. TechCrunch reported on the ongoing beta period, and Variety first revealed the AT&T device \u2014 model number C71KW-400 \u2014 a year ago. Based on leaks and FCC filings, we know a few things about AT&T\u2019s gadget. It runs Android TV, allows access to other streaming apps, and includes a voice search remote. It supports optical audio, has an HDMI output, and a USB port. That\u2019s all very par for the course, so there\u2019s little incentive for customers to want AT&T\u2019s hardware unless it\u2019s essentially free for DirecTV Now subscribers. AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now and Uverse businesses lost 346,000 subscribers this quarter, the company said in today\u2019s earnings release. DirecTV Now is trending upward, however, picking up 49,000 new accounts and now standing at 1.86 million total subscribers. That\u2019s still far off from the growth of a company like Netflix, which added 1.09 million new domestic subscribers last quarter. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
