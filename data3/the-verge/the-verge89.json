{"id": "Google\u2019s Gboard now guesses what GIFs and stickers you want to send", "paragraph": "Google is now using AI to suggest relevant GIFs, emoji, and stickers you can put in your conversation if you\u2019re using Gboard. As you\u2019re typing, a GIF icon might appear on the top left corner of Gboard. By tapping on it, you\u2019ll be able to pull up Google\u2019s suggestions for you.It\u2019s not as clever as it sounds, though. Google claims Gboard is using AI to scour thousands of emoji and stickers for the right ones, but it\u2019s mainly going off of the keywords you use. So say you mention a birthday or a dance, Gboard would find the relevant stickers and GIFs to reflect that. Apple\u2019s iOS Keyboard already does a similar thing: it will suggest an emoji when you type a word, and if you type \u201chappy birthday,\u201d mini fireworks will go off across your screen.The feature has already arrived on Android and the Gboard iOS app. So far, it\u2019s only available in the US in English, but Google says it plans to expand into more languages.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
