{"id": "MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro: how Apple\u2019s laptops compare", "paragraph": "Apple announced a new MacBook Air today during a hardware event in New York. The new MacBook Air finally gets a Retina display as well as modern processors, 50 percent thinner bezels, and an updated keyboard. It\u2019s the first major refresh of the MacBook Air in years, and it finally turns it into a modern, competitive machine. But how does it stack up against Apple\u2019s existing MacBook and MacBook Pro?\n    Related\n  Now that the MacBook Air has been revamped, it\u2019s no longer at the $1,000 price point. Instead, the Air has ditched its price advantage in favor of more competitive specs. But with it lining up so closely with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, it might seem easier to just spend $100 more for what is in some ways a more powerful model.At the same time, Apple hasn\u2019t updated the MacBook and MacBook Pro (without the Touch Bar) for over a year, meaning that the processors and keyboards are dated. Buying a laptop with a 7th Gen Intel chip means losing out on some performance gains, and getting a second-gen Butterfly keyboard could mean running into some of the issues people have been complaining about, such as unresponsive keys. The new MacBook Air still has a few shortcomings: its clock speeds are inferior to the Pro and, as is the case with its predecessors, it has low base storage (though there\u2019s an option to upgrade up to 1.5TB). Whether those are enough to sway you toward the larger MacBooks or not, looking at all the specs will definitely help with the decision. To simplify things, we\u2019re looking at the base specs and starting prices of each MacBook.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
