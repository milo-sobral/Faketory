{"id": "How the hell do you say Eevee\u2019s name?", "paragraph": "Of all the original 151 Pok\u00e9mon, Eevee\u2019s name might just be the easiest to pronounce. E-vee. Eee-vee. It\u2019s exactly what it looks like. Or so I thought, until I started playing Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!, where I listened my little fuzzy friend pronounce its own name as eh-vie for 30-something hours. Have I been saying its name wrong? Is Eevee saying its name wrong? Do pok\u00e9mon have accents?Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go is modeled after Pok\u00e9mon Yellow; the game is set in the series\u2019s original region, Kanto, with the first 151 pok\u00e9mon. Your starter, either Pikachu or Eevee, is chosen for you, depending on which version of the game you bought. Your furry little friend rides around at all times with you, and you can spend extra time rubbing its cute little head. Because I wound up with Let\u2019s Go, Eevee, I spent most of my time focusing on my brown little dog friend, and, in turn, obsessing over its name. In the cartoons, trainers pronounce Eevee in what I\u2019m calling the standard way:And here it is again from the older series:There\u2019s a discrepancy in how Eevee pronounces its own name. In the first video, you can hear it sort of approaching the \u201ceh-vie\u201d version, while in the latter video, it sort of just squeaks. Let\u2019s Go doesn\u2019t allow every pok\u00e9mon to happily say its own name. In fact, most make the garbled noises fans will be familiar with from the older games. And pok\u00e9mon sometimes stress different parts of their name differently, like Pikachu sometimes hitting a hard \u201cka\u201d when it speaks. In Let\u2019s Go, however, Eevee consistently defaults to this \u201ceh-vie\u201d version, whether you\u2019re patting its head or tossing it into battle. Does this matter? It is a fictional character in a made-up world, after all. Is this going to bother me until I get a definitive answer? Yes. Yes, it is. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
