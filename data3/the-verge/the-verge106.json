{"id": "Disney\u2019s Star Wars park will come with original music from John Williams", "paragraph": "When Disney\u2019s Star Wars land Galaxy\u2019s Edge opens next year, it\u2019ll come with a familiar soundtrack \u2014 Entertainment Weekly reports that John Williams will provide the score, and has a preview of what to expect, along with looks at two of the park\u2019s big experiences. The first of EW\u2019s videos shows off a new behind-the-scenes look at the park\u2019s construction, revealing an extensive array of buildings and landscapes, set to a music that is the \u201coverarching theme\u201d for Galaxy\u2019s Edge. EW also previews a pair of videos that highlight the main rides for the parks \u2014 Smuggler\u2019s Run, set aboard the Millennium Falcon, and Rise of the Resistance, set onboard a First Order ship. The construction video shows off a sprawling world called Batuu \u2014 which we\u2019ve seen a bit of already in Timothy Zahn\u2019s recent novel Thrawn: Alliances \u2014 and in particular, a village called Black Spire, described as a \u201cremote trading outpost\u201d in the midst of a forest of petrified trees. The score is epic and sweeping, and it certainly feels like it belongs to the Star Wars universe. Hopefully, Disney will release a companion soundtrack for those of us unable to visit in person. The two additional videos show off detailed and immersive experiences. For \u201cSmugglers Run\u201d, visitors will board the Millennium Falcon, and will pilot the ship away from Batuu, taking on one of three roles to ensure \u201cthe mission is a success.\u201d The video for \u201cRise of the Resistance\u201d shows off the finished interior of a First Order spaceship, complete with Stormtroopers and droids as a Resistance fleet drops out of hyperspace just outside. EW says that the experience will show off \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to be caught in the crossfire of a deep-space battle between the First Order and the X-Wing dogfighters\u201d and that visitors will be able to fight against Kylo Ren. The park is expected to open in the summer of 2019 at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and in the fall of 2019 at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Disney has said that the park will be a completely immersive experience, with guests interacting with in-universe characters, and staying in a hotel decked out like a starship.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
