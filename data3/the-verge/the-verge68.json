This type of sensor measures the time in which a light dot travels between the camera and subject, and could be used to capture 3D images. The system could potentially be used for augmented reality experiences or to improve the quality of images or 3D images, which Kuo notes could then be \u201cedited by an Apple Pencil on an iPad.\u201d Introduced last year with the iPhone X, Face ID uses more than 30,000 infrared dots to map your face. At the time, we noted that while the system works great in the dark, it was a bit more inconsistent under mixed or brighter lighting conditions.
