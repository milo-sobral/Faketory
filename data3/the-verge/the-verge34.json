{"id": "Epic would really like you to stop calling the new Fortnite monsters \u2018zombies\u2019", "paragraph": "Fortnite\u2019s Halloween festival, adorably named Fortnitemare, kicked off earlier today, and the most notable addition was a horde of monstrous-looking ghouls that resembled zombies. But they\u2019re not zombies. An Epic Games representative told The Verge that zombies don\u2019t exist within the Fortnite universe. There\u2019s a name for those fiery fantastical fiends that players will have to face in battle royale\u2019s newest mode, but it\u2019s not exactly fear-inducing. \u201cThey\u2019re officially \u2018Cube Monsters,\u2019\u201d the representative said. \u201cAcross Fortnite, we don\u2019t refer to any enemies as \u2018zombies.\u2019 In Save the World, you have \u2018Husks\u2019 and \u2018monsters\u2019 of various names and types.\u201d The rep did admit that people referring to Epic\u2019s new undead army, which first appeared in-game this morning, is understandable. The monstrous creatures do resemble horror\u2019s beloved freaks. Even Verge staffers had a difficult time trying to decide if we should label these supernatural beasts as zombies when they clearly have little in common with classic zombies seen in movies like Night of the Living Dead. We weren\u2019t the only ones confused, either. Chance the Rapper cried afoul on Twitter after his character was killed by a zombie. Ali-A, one of Fortnite\u2019s most popular players and YouTube creators, also referred to them as zombies. Not everyone called out the disturbing creatures as zombies, though. Chaosxsilencer, another popular YouTube creator, referred to them as monsters on Twitter. Still, the overwhelming majority of Fortnite players on Twitter definitely assumed these soulless corpses were zombies. Although many weren\u2019t happy with the plethora of walking dead roaming around their map \u2014 words like \u201cannoying\u201d and \u201cfrustrating\u201d accompanied many tweets on the subject \u2014 they were happily convinced that Fortnite was playing into the video game trope of adding zombies to a game. That\u2019s simply not the case. Epic wants Fortnite aficionados to know that it doesn\u2019t have any zombies stalking players in any part of its game. Just be prepared to deal with \u201cCube Monsters\u201d instead. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
