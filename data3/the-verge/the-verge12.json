{"id": "Google is using software to make the Pixel 3\u2019s screen corners even rounder", "paragraph": "Google is extending its design atheistic that favors subtle, rounded corners even further by manually adjusting the Pixel 3\u2019s screen corners during start up, as first spotted by an eagle-eyed Reddit user earlier today. Material Theme, an updated version of the company\u2019s software design philosophy, is the driving force behind the Gmail and Chrome redesigns of late, and you\u2019ll notice it most prevalently in the new Chrome tab design that eschews rough and pronounced corners for softer, rounded ones. Google isn\u2019t going so far as to turn the edges of the Pixel 3 display into Chrome tab replicas, but it is using a subtle software trick to \u201cshrink\u201d the radius of each corner of the display to produce more rounded corners. The radii change means that the Pixel 3 screen isn\u2019t using the available screen real estate at its absolute maximum, though it\u2019s a pretty much imperceptible cutoff unless you closely observe the change during the phone\u2019s start up phase.In the GIF below, you can see the corner change shape a few moments after the device is initially turned on: Notably, Google isn\u2019t doing this on the Pixel 3 XL, as best as we can tell from rebooting The Verge\u2019s review model numerous times. That\u2019s interesting mostly because some people have commented on the lack of consistency between the display curve on the edge-to-edge top and that of the bottom bezel, or \u201cchin,\u201d on the larger version. Theoretically, it sounds like Google could do something on the software side to make the corners match, but it doesn\u2019t look like that will happen unless a ton of users really complain about it. Still, some people have noticed:So I don\u2019t have a problem with the Pixel 3 XL\u2019s notch. But once you notice that the top corners and bottom corners of the display don\u2019t have the same radius, you can\u2019t unsee it. pic.twitter.com/BSrQlL1BjxA few users Reddit thread mentioned above note that the same screen corner alteration occurs on the Pixel 2 XL, but that would make sense considering both the Pixel 2 XL and standard Pixel 3 have similar-shaped displays and lack the edge-to-edge look of the Pixel 3 XL. Either way, this isn\u2019t something that will affect anyone\u2019s ability to use the standard Pixel 3 or any visual experience on the device. It\u2019s mostly just a small little quirk that shows Google\u2019s aesthetic tastes when it comes to corner design. Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
