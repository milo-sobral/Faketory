{"id": "Microsoft made an app to rate your facial expressions against emojis", "paragraph": "Microsoft has launched a free Windows app that uses machine learning to guess the facial expression you\u2019re making when imitating an emoji. Called Emoji8, the app gives you a score for how well you recreate the emoji, and it\u2019s mostly meant to show off the capabilities of this brand of artificial intelligence in an accessible way.The app serves up an emoji for you to mimic, analyzes the video feed from your computer\u2019s webcam, then tells you your percentage of accuracy. Then, oddly, it gives you the option of creating a gif with some of your \u201ccraziest facial expressions\u201d to share on Twitter. On Microsoft\u2019s end, Emoji8 is supposed to show how quick and flexible its machine learning prowess is. From a user end, it\u2019s a bit weird to show off how you 90 percent matched a crying emoji to your friends.If you do feel like seeing if you can nail a surprised look according to the app, Emoji8 is free in the Microsoft Store.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
