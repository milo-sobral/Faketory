{"id": "Facebook hired a new public defender, and he should start with WhatsApp", "paragraph": "\n    The Interface is a daily column about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe to the newsletter here.\n  Today, three shorter items to carry us into the weekend.One, Facebook has hired a new head of global policy and communications to replace Elliot Schrage. It\u2019s Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom. Clegg is a former European Commission trade negotiator, where he played a role in punishing tech companies for anticompetitive behavior \u2014 most notably Google, which received a $5 billion fine for issues involving Android. With Facebook currently in the crosshairs of European regulators over a wide range of issues, Clegg brings a perspective and a clout that the company has previously lacked.British people have a proud tradition of loathing their elected leaders, and they eagerly traded zingers about Clegg on Friday morning, many of which are funny only if you have a solid grasp of British politics. (It helps to know that Clegg presided over a collapse in support for his party, the Liberal Democrats, and that the party abandoned a pledge to oppose tuition increases for students. The Guardian has a helpful mini-profileembedded in his op-ed about taking the new job.)Clegg is a former journalist, a centrist, and unlike Schrage, has a large Twitter following. Is he what Facebook needs for the role? A global head of policy and communications needs to be very good at two things: knowing people, and arguing. By that measure, Clegg would seem to fit the bill. In any case, he deserves a chance. Here\u2019s what he said in the Guardian:I remain a stubborn optimist about the progressive potential to society of technological innovation. It can transform how we work, play and build relationships. It can help to protect our environment and keep our streets safe. It will fundamentally change how we teach our children at school and at home. It is transforming healthcare and transport. If the tech industry can work sensibly with governments, regulators, parliaments and civic society around the world, I believe we can enhance the benefits of technology while diminishing the often unintended downsides.Of course, managing those unintended downsides will probably represent the bulk of Clegg\u2019s time at Facebook. He\u2019ll have his work cut out for him.Two, the new head of WhatsApp made his first public comments about an issue of any significance. Chris Daniels, who took over the messaging app during Facebook\u2019s big org-chart shuffle in May, posted to the company blog on Thursday to explain how Facebook is trying to prevent WhatsApp from being misused in Brazil. (This was also the subject of my column yesterday; Daniels\u2019 note hadn\u2019t been posted by press time.)Anyone hoping to better understand Daniels\u2019 product philosophy will be disappointed by his charmless and notably defensive blog post, which includes the full complement of October 2018 Facebook talking points: misinformation didn\u2019t start with us; most people don\u2019t use WhatsApp to spread misinformation; a global platform will inevitably host both the good and the bad. He also adopts Facebook\u2019s unfortunate tendency to speak about world-scale problems in percentages.Today, over 90 percent of messages sent on WhatsApp in Brazil are individual, one-on-one conversations. The majority of groups are about just six people \u2014 a conversation so private and personal that it would fit in your living room.(You can stop over 90 percent of asteroids from crashing into your planet and still have a major problem on your hands.)Nowhere in Daniels\u2019 post does he acknowledge some of the unique ways in which his popular app, with its potent combination of encryption and viral sharing mechanics, has created new and extremely difficult problems for Brazil. (A far-right, anti-democratic climate change skeptic is now poised to win, after his backers funded a fake news campaign on WhatsApp.) Instead Daniels lists six steps the company has taken to reduce its level of harm, before saying \u201cit will take all of us\u201d to solve the problem.In the meantime, it\u2019s not clear that Daniels even understands what the problem is. He comes across as a colonial governor telling a restless public that the crown is taking their concerns very seriously. Brazil deserves better. So does WhatsApp.Three, the media had a weeklong fight over whether Facebook intentionally misled them about the extent to which people had an interest in watching video, prompting publishers to lay off their writers in an ultimately fruitless \u201cpivot to video\u201d that impoverished journalists and journalism. The spark was a lawsuit I mentioned here earlier in the week, in which advertisers said a metrics reporting error \u2014 which Facebook acknowledged in 2016 \u2014 was well known within the company for a year.At issue is how Facebook reported video views. Here\u2019s Suzanna Vranica with a concise explanation:For two years, Facebook had counted only video views that lasted more than three seconds when calculating its \u201caverage duration of video viewed\u201d metric. Video views of under three seconds weren\u2019t factored in, thereby inflating the average length of a view.Facebook replaced the metric with \u201caverage watch time,\u201d which reflects video views of any duration.The metric may have been overstated. But as the linchpin of a theory that publishers pivoted to video on a false pretext, it\u2019s pretty flimsy. As Laura Hazard Owen notes, much more important was the way Facebook talked about video, with Mark Zuckerberg himself predicting that video would soon become the dominant form of communication on the platform.Much of the conversation has concluded that people did not want to watch news-oriented video. This conversation tends to omit the existence of YouTube, on which people do watch quite a lot of news-oriented video. (May I please recommend to you the Vox channel, with 1.1 billion views and a successful Netflix show, or Verge Science, which reached more than half a million subscribers in under a year.)In 2016, traditional publishers were still having trouble cracking YouTube. But they were willing to take a flier on Facebook, because more than 1 billion people were looking at it every day, and Facebook had turned the knobs on video all the way up. Importantly, some publishers appeared to be succeeding with a video strategy:In September, Tasty\u2019s main Facebook page was the third-biggest video account on Facebook with nearly 1.7 billion video views, according to Tubular Labs. Viewership per video is also staggering: During the last three months, Tasty\u2019s Facebook videos have averaged 22.8 million video views in the first 30 days alone. That\u2019s better than BuzzFeed\u2019s main Facebook page and the separate BuzzFeed Food account, which averaged 4.7 million views and 1.1 million views per video in the same timeframe.Overall, Tasty now accounts for 37 percent of BuzzFeed\u2019s video views, according to Tubular. This is all the more remarkable considering BuzzFeed started Tasty just in July 2015.There were three problems with Facebook video. One, Facebook never figured out a good way for publishers to make money from them. Publishers assumed that some kind of pre- or mid- or post-roll advertising would offer a return on their investment, but it never did. Two, Facebook had a product problem. The News Feed is meant for rapid, near-mindless scrolling; video is meant for intent, lean-back viewing. A handful of formats, most notably Tasty\u2019s, thrived in the News Feed. But most died \u2014 which is why Facebook is now shunting video over to its Watch tab, and even there nothing has really broken out of the pack.Finally, in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Facebook ratcheted down the amount of publisher content in the feed, in the hopes that seeing more of our friends and family would discourage us from sharing viral memes and destroying democracy. Video will still play a major role in Facebook\u2019s future, but it\u2019s likely to look more like the video you see in Instagram stories and less like those square videos with text captions posted on B-roll.There\u2019s a valid critique of Facebook in there somewhere. But much of the anger feels, to me, misplaced. Journalists would have benefited if Facebook had done a better job predicting the future. But publishers could have done a better job predicting the future, too.Justice Dept. Accuses Russians of Interfering in Midterm ElectionsHere\u2019s our first real piece of evidence that Russia is actively interfering in our current midterm election here in the United States. Adam Goldman reports:Russians working for a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin engaged in an elaborate campaign of \u201cinformation warfare\u201d to interfere with the midterm elections, federal prosecutors said on Friday in unsealing a criminal complaint against one of them.The woman, Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, was involved in an effort \u201cto spread distrust toward candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system,\u201d prosecutors said.McCain\u2019s a \u2018geezer\u2019 and Ryan\u2019s an \u2018absolute nobody\u2019: Russia\u2019s playbook for sounding American in Facebook propagandaCraig Timberg, Tony Romm, Brian Fung examine the propaganda in Russia\u2019s US midterm election campaign, which comes out of the unsealed criminal complaint above.The late Sen. John McCain was \u201can old geezer.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan is \u201ca complete and absolute nobody.\u201d And the investigation into possible collusion between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d led by \u201can establishment puppet.\u201dName the subject, and Russian disinformation operatives had a playbook on how to pass themselves off as politically active Americans as they secretly sought to manipulate U.S. voters online \u2013 on both the right and the left \u2013 with incendiary phrases, glib putdowns and appeals to pre-existing political biases. And the same tactics honed during the 2016 presidential election carried over into the runup toward the 2018 midterm congressional vote.Disinformation Spreads on WhatsApp Ahead of Brazilian ElectionMike Isaac and Kevin Roose examine the state of disinformation in Brazil ahead of the election:\u201cPeople entered this election with a sense of hyperpolarization,\u201d said Roberta Braga, an associate director at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cThere is a lot of distrust in politics and politicians and political establishments in general.\u201d\u201cPeople entered this election with a sense of hyperpolarization,\u201d said Roberta Braga, an associate director at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cThere is a lot of distrust in politics and politicians and political establishments in general.\u201d\u2018Corrupt Chris\u2019 and \u2018Two-Faced Tammy\u2019: Candidates Try Their Best Trump ImpressionsTrumpian name-calling is now a feature of many state and local elections, Kevin Roose reports.New Research Shows Facebook Making Strides Against False NewsTessa Lyons cites new research showing that the volume of fake news shared on Facebook has declined by more than 50 percent:First, Alcott, Gentzkow and Yu published a study on misinformation on Facebook and Twitter (PDF). The researchers began by compiling a list of 570 sites that had been identified as false news sources in previous studies and online lists. They then measured the volume of Facebook engagements (shares, comments and reactions) and Twitter shares for all stories from these 570 sites published between January 2015 and July 2018. The researchers found that on Facebook, interactions with these false news sites declined by more than half after the 2016 election, suggesting that \u201cefforts by Facebook following the 2016 election to limit the diffusion of misinformation may have had a meaningful impact.\u201dLast week, a University of Michigan study on misinformation (PDF) had similar findings about the effectiveness of our work. The Michigan team compiled a list of sites that commonly share misinformation by looking at judgements made by two external organizations, Media Bias/Fact Check and Open Sources. Exclusive: Twitter pulls down bot network that pushed pro-Saudi talking points about disappeared journalistTwitter suspended a network of suspected Twitter bots on Thursday that pushed pro-Saudi Arabia talking points about the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the past week.Khashoggi misinformation highlights a growing number of fake fact-checkersDays after the reported murder of Jamal Khashoggi, misinformation is everywhere, report Daniel Funke and Alexios Mantzarlis:Saudi media outlets reported a conspiracy theory that Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is fake in an apparent effort to discredit Turkish and American intelligence. Reuters fell for a fake news story about the firing of a Saudi general consul. Some accounts are promoting a nonsensical video from a guy who wears a strainer on his head. And the Saudi government itself has threatened anyone who spreads \u201cfake news\u201d online with lengthy prison terms and heavy fines.Inside Facebook\u2019s Stormy Debate Over \u2018Political Diversity\u2019Issie Lapowsky talks to recently departed Facebook engineer Brian Amerige, who had accused the company of a \u201cpolitical monoculture that\u2019s intolerant of different views.\u201c But he\u2019s leery of becoming a poster boy for Republicans complaining about \u201cbias.\u201d\u201cI have every confidence that they take these issues really, really seriously, and they\u2019ve treated me with a lot of respect,\u201d Amerige says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty intimately involved.\u201dLast week, Amerige left Facebook over disagreements about the company\u2019s platform-wide hate speech policy, which he describes as \u201cdangerous and impractical\u201d for a platform that promotes openness. But he had spent the two months before that working closely with Facebook\u2019s human resources team on ways to foster what he calls \u201cpolitical diversity.\u201d One initiative Amerige says they discussed was an updated employee speech policy that would draw a distinction between attacking people\u2019s ideas (which would be permitted) and attacking their character (which would be prohibited). He\u2019s unsure whether Facebook plans to implement the ideas.Google engineer refused to code a censored product for ChinaSpeaking of departed employees, PRI\u2019s The World talks to ex-Googler Vijay Boyapati, who quit in 2007 over the company\u2019s decision to enter the Chinese market.When I was there, I thought it was morally wrong for two reasons: One was that there had been no internal debate about it in terms of Google News \u2014 the product I\u2019d worked on. And so I wanted to bring that up because I thought it was the wrong move for Google. If a journalist does have the courage to write about something controversial and Google was asked to censor them. And as someone who\u2019d worked on the product, you\u2019d have the knowledge that someone\u2019s voice had been silenced by something that you built. And that makes me deeply uncomfortable. The Hunt for False NewsFacebook is launching a new series of blog posts in which they describe how they found fake news and determined it to be false. In episode one, learn if a Saudi Arabian man actually spit in a woman\u2019s face.I fell for Facebook fake news. Here\u2019s why millions of you did, too.Speaking of fake news, Geoffrey Fowler got taken in by a video that showed a commercial plane appearing to do a barrel roll during landing:The photorealism of Tsirbas\u2019s clip played a big role in making the fake story go viral. And that makes it typical: Misinformation featuring manipulated photos and videos is among the most likely to go viral, Facebook\u2019s Lyons said. Sometimes, like in this case, it employs shots from real news reports to make it seem just credible enough. \u201cThe really crazy things tend to get less distribution than the things that hit the sweet spot where they could be believable,\u201d Lyons said.Even after decades of Photoshop and CG films, most of us are still not very good about challenging the authenticity of images \u2014 or telling the real from the fake. That includes me: In an online test made by software maker Autodesk called Fake or Foto, I correctly identified the authenticity of just 22 percent of their images. (You can test yourself here.)YouTube introduces mini-player for desktop browsersYouTube has finally rolled out mini-players for browser users. The mobile app has used it for quite some time. This will allow users to continue watching a video while browsing for something new at the same time.YouTube tweaks its video embeds to include easy channel subscribe buttonBig day for little YouTube updates! In addition to the one above, and this one, which is just what it says on the tin, you can also now buy concert tickets on Eventbrite from music video pages.David Simon talks to the creator of Godwin\u2019s law about his Twitter suspensions.The creator of The Wire talks to the creator of the law that as the length of an online conservation continues, the odds that it will eventually include a comparison to Hitler approaches 1. Simon hits hard on his pet issue, which is that he should be able to call a Nazi anything he wants to:The last thing that Twitter should be doing is policing decorum, or trying to leech hostility from the platform. Why? Because the appropriate response to overt racism, to anti-Semitism, to libel, to organized disinformation campaigns is not to politely reason with such in long threads of fact-sharing. All that does is lend a fundamental credence to the worst kind of speech\u2014which, grievously, seems to be the paradigm that Twitter prefers at present. It\u2019s a paradigm that offers two basic choices: Ignore the deplorati\u2014which allows the dishonesty or cruelty to stand in public view and acquire the veneer of credibility by doing so. Or worse, engage in some measure of serious disputation with all manner of horseshit, which also grants trash the veneer of credibility.In 1935, the reply to Streicher or Goebbels quoting The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and asserting that Jews drink the blood of baptized Christian babies is not to begin arguing that \u201cno, Jews do not drink Christian baby blood\u201d and deliver a long explanation of The Protocols as a czarist forgery in chapter and verse. The correct response is to call Julius Streicher a submoronic piece of shit, marking him as such for the rest of the sentient, and move on to some more meaningful exchange of ideas. So it is with Twitter. COMO III: Content Moderation and the Future of Online SpeechI\u2019ll be in New York City on Thursday to speak at this conference about content moderation on big platforms.
