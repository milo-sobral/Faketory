{"id": "Comcast should be investigated for antitrust violations, say small cable companies", "paragraph": "An industry group wants antitrust regulators to investigate whether Comcast-NBCUniversal is abusing its power to hurt smaller television and internet service providers. The American Cable Association (ACA), which represents over 700 small and medium-sized cable operators, has asked US Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim to \u201cimmediately\u201d open an investigation into Comcast\u2019s practices. Comcast denied that the claims have merit, and the Justice Department hasn\u2019t publicly responded. But the ACA has found a potential supporter in President Donald Trump \u2014 who tweeted about its claims this afternoon.The ACA claims Comcast has a uniquely powerful hold on the US cable industry because it controls a large chunk of \u201cmust have\u201d programming like NBC\u2019s regional sports channels. The group argues that the Comcast \u201chas shown a willingness to harm rivals\u201d in the past, even while bound by a 2011 consent decree that expired earlier this year. The letter is dated November 6th but was published today, after Fox Business Networks reported on its existence last week.Trump appears to have caught a follow-up Fox Business segment today, prompting a tweet about the ACA:American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws. \u201cThese guys are acting much worse, and have much more potential for damage to consumers, than anything AT&T-Time Warner would do.\u201d Charlie GasparinoContra Trump\u2019s description, the letter doesn\u2019t seem to describe \u201croutine\u201d violations of antitrust law. It\u2019s primarily arguing that there\u2019s a huge risk of Comcast abusing its market position, while explaining just how much damage could result if Comcast did so. The ACA has put forward more concrete claims in the past, though \u2014 like a 2017 complaint that Comcast was forcing smaller cable providers to bundle unwanted NBC-owned channels into TV packages, driving up their costs.ACA communications VP Ted Hearn says companies will only disclose Comcast\u2019s alleged misbehavior as part of a confidential Justice Department investigation. \u201cACA member providers have extensive ongoing dealings with Comcast-NBCU and are naturally concerned that the media giant will engage in retaliatory actions should they publicly disclose information about how Comcast-NBCU has unreasonably disadvantaged them,\u201d Hearn tells The Verge. \u201cThis process will enable the Department to conduct a thorough examination of the facts, and the Department can then disclose its results at the appropriate time.\u201dComcast provided The Verge with a statement denying any wrongdoing. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in The Verge\u2019s parent company, Vox Media.) \u201cAt Comcast NBCUniversal, we are competing in this dynamic environment the way we always have \u2014 by continuing to innovate and conducting our business in compliance with antitrust laws and other legal requirements,\u201d writes senior vice president Sena Fitzmaurice. \u201cWe believe that ACA\u2019s letter is without merit and constitutes an inappropriate attempt to gain leverage in the commercial marketplace.\u201dThe Justice Department is currently trying to stop a merger between AT&T and Time Warner, and the ACA strategically argues that Comcast is more dangerous than those companies combined. But the department may already have its sights on Comcast. In August, Delrahim warned Comcast that it would continue monitoring potential antitrust threats even after the consent decree expired. Last month, Delrahim also said the Justice Department would investigate whether Comcast was using its 30 percent share in Hulu to undermine the streaming video service, which competes with traditional cable.The ACA\u2019s letter also raises concerns involving Hulu, suggesting that Comcast could effectively hold the service hostage. \u201cWe have heard from ACA members that they fear that ComcastNBCU may restrict, if it is not already restricting, their ability to access Hulu and make it available to their customers as an alternative to their cable offerings,\u201d reads the letter. (Hulu is generally found on the web, but cable operators can add it as a \u201cchannel\u201d for more traditional TV viewing.) However, Comcast only holds a minority share in Hulu, and it will have even less influence after a Disney-Fox merger gives Disney control over 60 percent of the service.Trump has vocally denounced monopolistic behavior among increasingly consolidated tech, media, and telecommunications companies; he also opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger. But his complaints often look like outgrowths of unrelated personal grudges \u2014 Time Warner owns CNN, a network Trump loathes, for instance. Trump once called the NBC news network \u201cworse than even CNN\u201d and implied that NBC should have its broadcasting license revoked, so it\u2019s not surprising he\u2019d promote a complaint about its parent company.President Trump has a history of attacking companies and never following up. But regardless of how seriously he takes this complaint, the ACA is tapping into some existing concerns by the Justice Department.Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future."}
