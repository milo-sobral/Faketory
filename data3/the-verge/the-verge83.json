{"id": "Updated patent hints at PS4 controller with a touchscreen", "paragraph": "Sony\u2019s PlayStation controllers have largely gone unchanged in the 20-plus years that the console family has been around \u2014 after all, if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. But a recently published update to Sony\u2019s PlayStation controller patent hints at an interesting potential addition that would replace the DualShock 4\u2019s touch-sensitive control pad with a full-fledged touchscreen, via DualShockers.Sony has flirted with interactive controllers before \u2014 the current LED light bar on the existing PS4 controller with colors that change to react to whatever is going on in the game is a good example \u2014 but a touchscreen could provide even more opportunities for interactive feedback, letting Sony do things like display in-game stats, a mini-map, or current inventory.It\u2019s an idea that we\u2019ve seen before with things like Nintendo\u2019s (failed) Wii U or even further back in gaming history with the (also failed) Sega Dreamcast. Plus, developers haven\u2019t really embraced Sony\u2019s existing DualShock 4 touchpad for anything other than a very large pause button, and adding a display to a PlayStation controller will likely just make it more expensive. But hey, maybe Sony will be the company to get the screen-controller idea right! Of course, this is just a patent for now, so there\u2019s no indication of whether Sony will actually do that. But since it\u2019s already in the early stages of working on a next-generation PlayStation, maybe that future console will show up with some extra screens to go with it.
