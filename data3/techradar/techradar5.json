We've run through all the latest rumors pointing to a PC release, and made our best guesses for when we'd expect it to land.Rumors kicked off in mid-October after the online retailer MediaMarkt listed a PC version of the game on its website, with a placeholder date of December 31, 2019. The listing has since been pulled, however.Things heated up again after a LinkedIn profile for a Rockstar employee appeared to list credits as a programmer on the PC version of the game \u2013 though this, again, was amended after the media attention that attracted.The firmest clues we have appeared when Rockstar released a mobile / tablet companion app alongside the new Red Dead game, mainly as a hub for viewing in-game stats, journal entries, and map locations (see image below).Red Dead Redemption 2 companion appSome savvy data-mining, though, contained references to PC-quality graphics settings \u2013 shadow quality, grass rendering, and the like \u2013 as well as lines explicitly naming PC, such as 'PARAM_companionAutoConnectIpPC' or 'CommandIsPcVersion(void)'. You can see the full list on Rockstar Intel.There's also a reference to 'Oculus', which can only really refer to VR capability for the game. Given the option to play the entire game in an immersive first-person perspective, virtual reality would be a natural fit \u2013 and Red Dead 2 VR would be most at home on a dedicated Oculus or PC-bound headset.Red Dead Redemption 2: ripe for VR?So when could Red Dead Redemption 2 come to PC? At this point Rockstar is unlikely to make an announcement before the end of 2018. If anything, an announcement in January could be a savvy move to keep up interest in the new year.While 2010's Red Dead Redemption never came to PC, previous Rockstar games like GTA IV or GTA V both took\u00a0around six months to make the jump to PC after their initial console launch. So that means we could be looking at an April/May 2019 launch date this time around.Given the scale of the the open-world game, it's not wholly surprising for a PC port to follow a few months after \u2013 it takes a lot of work to get the game running on different systems. But the longer PC gamers have to wait, the less likely they are to maintain their anticipation.\u00a0And if the game gets delayed too long, it may end up competing with CD Projekt Red's similarly open-world Cyberpunk 2077, which is expected to release in early 2019. Sure, the open plains of Rockstar's Western seem a world away from a neon Blade Runner-esque dystopia \u2013 but gamers only have so much time on their hands, and both developers are unlikely to want to be competing directly.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
