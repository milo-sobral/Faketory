The main event - Daniel Cormier vs Derrick Lewis - is a serious heavyweight fight and they're all set to go head-to-head. And we'll tell you how to live stream UFC 230 from anywhere.UFC 230 takes place at Madison Square Garden in New York City, on Saturday, November 3.\u00a0The main event - Daniel Cormier vs Derrick Lewis - will take place at around 10pm local time, which means 7pm PT (2am GMT and 1pm AEDT on Sunday).This UFC 230 Heavyweight bout will see American and former Olympic wrestler Daniel Cormier \"DC\", defend his title from fellow American Derrick Lewis \"The Black Beast\".Cormier has been enjoying the burden of that champion belt since July's UFC 226 when he knocked out Stipe Miocic in the first round. Coincidentally, it's a knock out punch that's earned Lewis his shot at the title, too, so this championship bout could all be over with one mighty blow.In a fight against Alexander Volkov earlier this year, Derrick Lewis managed to knock the Russian out with just 11 seconds left in the fight. His career had perhaps been faltering until that point so he could be about to make a huge jump up \u2013 or get knocked down hard.Either way this will be an entertaining fight with the huge fighters throwing their weight - and each other - around.\u00a0So stick with us if you want a UFC 230 live stream. And we're not talking about some dodgy feed you might find at Reddit that can leave you vulnerable to attacks.How to watch the UFC 230 with a VPN\nIf you live in a country where there's no UFC broadcast, then there's still a way you can watch.

A VPN is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location.Virtual Private Networks are also handy if you're concerned about streaming safely on the web, thanks to the encryption they use to hide your details.
