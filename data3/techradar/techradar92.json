{"id": "TechRadar proHow to ensure a full live-streaming experience", "paragraph": "\nBy\nDr Stefan Birrer\n2018-11-12T14:18:18Z\n\nVPN\n\u00a0\n\nNo live streaming service or technology can stream at full HD 1080p, in real-time and with synchronous viewing at broadcast scale. That all being an industry way of saying no one can deliver a real-time stream to users without at least sacrificing quality of the stream or number of viewers able to watch the stream. \u201cLive\u201d streams and real-time streams are often talked about synonymously, but that\u2019s not the case.Live streams are what most consumers are experiencing today, but the goal should be to provide them with real-time streams, where there is no latency between what\u2019s being broadcast and what the viewer sees. Once networks, franchises, hot trivia apps and everyone else in this space can make the transition from live to real-time streams they can start to capitalize on the benefits of an audience engaging one-to-one. With today\u2019s streaming providers, however, it\u2019s a challenge because they cannot support high quality and potentially infinite users at the same time while delivering a near zero latency stream.Additionally, there are a number of barriers live streaming services need to overcome as the world transitions from a linear viewing experience of traditional TV to the more mobile, stream-centric viewing experience from OTT services like Amazon, Netflix, and even places like Twitch and YouTube. Recent research Phenix commissioned actually showed the cost of all these services and content that are still tied to cable as just a few of the reasons consumers were resisting the move to more live or real-time content.And that\u2019s a tall order for anyone in the streaming game right now \u2013 deliver high-quality real-time content and make sure it\u2019s content that people want and are able to consume with ease.Currently, the \u2018live\u2019 streaming industry still suffers from 30-90 second delays. That\u2019s an eternity in this day and age, where mobile and social media intersect every moment of the consumer\u2019s life. \u00a0Who would be happy seeing a tweet about a touchdown before they even get to see it on their stream? With Amazon taking on the NFL broadcasts, for example, this is a real possibility that needs to be proactively addressed.Hulu Live and ESPN+ both recently held up hitting the 1M subscriber mark as a sign of success for their OTT offerings, but the way we see it is it\u2019s not about the first million, it\u2019s about the quality of the user experience which will ultimately drive the decision of whether they continue to sign-up. The \u2018live\u2019 experience has potential to be a significant differentiator for a service like Hulu or ESPN+ if they can make sure it\u2019s up to par \u2013 in fact our recent research showed more than one in four consumers wouldn\u2019t pay for live content yet because of poor quality.For ESPN in particular, they are still reporting drops in cable subscribers every year, so if they think the OTT product is ready to replace traditional TV, based on the quality of the streams, at this point we think it\u2019s still unlikely. To overcome it they need to rethink the technology used to power the experience, particularly live content. If the technology remains as is for them, with 60 seconds or more of latency along with other shortcomings including buffering and platform crashes, then they aren\u2019t even close to being where they need to be for an A+ product consumers are hungry for. If they want their OTT product to replace or even significantly supplement their linear offering, then the quality of the product must dramatically improve.Almost everyone we talk to has this conundrum \u2013 latency all around is terrible \u2013 and they need to figure out what they can do to mitigate. One of the major features we\u2019re incorporating into our product to help get to that perfect real-time synchronous stream at scale is something called adaptive bitrate. The OTT services have been working in this realm for some time to make sure they\u2019re delivering a high-quality stream, but it\u2019s rare in real-time streams. Essentially a transcoding engine creates multiple bitrate renditions of the input stream and selects the appropriate rendition for each viewer based on their individual device and real-time network conditions. The result is minor buffering, faster start times and a high-quality experience regardless of the strength of the connection.The financial implications are considerable \u2013 both from a consumer subscription and advertising perspective.We found more than one in six consumers using a streaming service would be likely to switch to an alternative with a better \u2018live\u2019 option. At the end of the day, not every streaming service on the market today is going to survive the next decade; growth will plateau once consumers hit their max on price and services they want to deal with. Having the right \u2018live\u2019 experience not only gets subscribers, but helps you keep them once they\u2019re signed-up.From an advertising perspective, it\u2019s inevitable live streaming services are going to want to insert ads into the stream. Our research showed more than half of viewers would abandon a poor-quality stream in 90 seconds or less \u2013 not a statistic you want to parade in front of advertisers. If the stream is bad, the ads won\u2019t be seen. It\u2019s as simple as that. To get and keep those advertising dollars, a buttoned-up stream is a must.Again, consumer tolerance for a bad stream is not good \u2013 90 seconds for many of us. Hesitancy to cut cord can be everything from price (multiple streaming subscriptions add up quickly!) to access to content, where major events like awards shows and sports events are still heavily tied to traditional broadcast deals, so their audiences stay tied too.\u00a0Once a few folks figure out the benefits of real-time streaming the rest will follow \u2013 the new level of interactivity it can lead to are just too exciting to miss out on. It\u2019s likely the sports industry gets there first.For example, in September Amazon somewhat quietly began testing out interactive features in the NFL games its streaming online. Imagine how exciting the potential for fan engagement is when they\u2019re watching and interacting in real-time? Especially now that in-game betting is increasingly on the table \u2013 you can\u2019t afford any delay between what\u2019s on the screen and what\u2019s being put up for a bet if you\u2019re the NFL, Amazon or one of the many betting companies supporting behind the scenes. It\u2019s a small taste of the endless possibilities for user engagement once the \u2018live\u2019 stream is actually operating in real-time.\u00a0Dr. Stefan Birrer is CEO and cofounder of PhenixTechradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
