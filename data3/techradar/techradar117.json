Those people were left out of pocket, and the charges amounted to millions of pounds,\u201d said Gaucho Rasmussen, Ofcom\u2019s Director of Investigations and Enforcement.\u201cThat is unacceptable. These fines send a clear message to all phone and broadband firms that they must play by the rules, in the interests of their customers.\u201dOfcom\u2019s investigation found that over a six-year period, EE\u2019s discounted contact terms did not clearly state the early termination charges. Around 400,000 customers who chose to leave their deal were overcharged by \u00a313.5 million because EE \u201cmiscalculated\u201d these charges by basing them on the original cost of the tariff rather than the discounted rate.Not all those concerned paid these charges as EE waived some of them, especially if the customer chose to remain with the network. This accounts for the lower \u00a34.3 million figure that was actually overpaid.EE\u2019s fine took into account the fact that \u00a32.7 million had been returned to customers it had been able to identify.\u2018\u2019We accept Ofcom\u2019s findings and recognise that we have made a mistake,\u201d said an EE spokesperson. \u201cWe apologise to customers with discounted tariffs who paid more than they should have when cancelling their contracts early. We\u2019ve already refunded customers and changed the way we calculate early termination charges, and we will continue to focus on ensuring our policies are clear and fair for all customers.\u2019\u2019As for Virgin Media, Ofcom found the company\u2019s exit charges were higher than customers had agreed to for a one year period. Up to 82,000 customers were overcharged by \u00a32.8 million which amounts to an average of \u00a334 per person affected. However 6,000 subscribers were overbilled by more than \u00a3100.Virgin Media has refunded or made donations to charity on behalf of 99.8 per cent of all those affected and has reduced the level of its early exit charges. It has also updated its processes and customer agent materials.However it has objected to the severity of the penalty and rejected the conclusion from Ofcom that its charges discouraged customers from switching provider.\u201cWe profoundly disagree with Ofcom\u2019s ruling. This decision and fine is not justified, proportionate or reasonable,\u201d said Virgin Media CEO Tom Mockridge. \u201cAs soon as we became aware of the mistake we apologised and took swift action to put it right by paying refunds, with interest, to everyone affected.\u201cWe wholeheartedly reject the claim by Ofcom that our ETC levels dissuaded customers from switching. This unreasonable decision and excessive fine does not reflect the swift actions we took, the strong evidence we have presented, or our consistent, open and transparent cooperation with the regulator.\u00a0We will be appealing Ofcom\u2019s decision.\u201dOfcom told TechRadar Pro that it has an industry-wide monitoring and enforcement programme for early termination charges and that it had no other open investigations into any other providers.Techradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
