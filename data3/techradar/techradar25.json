We found they sit comfortably in the ear when you're listening to music and won't easily shake out - although it would be nice to see more than one other earbud size included in the box, as one size never fits all.\u00a0The TicPods Free have stems that sit out of your ear that contain the battery and touch controls. You can run your finger along the one on the right to change the volume, plus you can double tap to skip a track or hold your finger for a few seconds to boot up your voice assistant and ask a question.Similar to the AirPods, the stems are pretty long - so if you\u2019re not a fan of that look, you probably aren\u2019t going to like these in-ears. Although having longer stems means that it\u2019s easier to use swipe gestures, we felt that they did look a little unwieldy and that they could be designed to look more discreet.The case feels well-made with a snap-shut close, and small LED\u2019s on the front that light up green when you open it and while charging.With an IPX5 water resistant rating, you'll find the earbuds will be resistant to both rain and sweat, but we wouldn't recommend dropping them in a puddle as it may cause some issues.You have the choice of three colors too with the headphones being sold in either white, dark blue or red (but we found the red shade to be more orange than you'd expect, which is worth bearing in mind if you\u2019re thinking of buying them).All three of the colors look good, but we'd opt for the dark blue ones if you're looking for a more discreet look - and if you\u2019re looking for a convincing AirPods dupe, stick with the white.One of the biggest benefits here is that the TicPods Free will work with whatever default voice assistant you have on your phone. They work with Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa, depending on what one you have up and running on your phone - we tried them out with both Android and iOS devices, and found that the Bluetooth connectivity worked well, and we had no problems communicating with voice assistants using the earphones.\u00a0Making calls with the TicPods was fine, however the inbuilt mic isn\u2019t the most powerful in the world, and they can make you sound slightly distant to the person on the other end of the line.We really like the touch controls on the sides of the stems, and found them to be really intuitive, with simple swipe and tap gestures designed to control music playback, Bluetooth, and voice assistant connectivity.Functionality such as in-ear detection is here too, so once you place them in your ear you\u2019re automatically be greeted with what you were last listening to, which is handy.\u00a0To pause your music, you just need to remove the right earbud, meaning you don\u2019t need to fumble around for your phone if you want to stop listening.In terms of audio quality, we felt the TicPods Free performed pretty well, with a good balance across treble, mid, and bass frequencies, and a decent amount of sonic power behind them.However, we did notice a touch of distortion when using them at higher volumes, with guitar-based tracks in particular sounding slightly grainy - although bass guitars sounded warm and rounded. We tried them on Hazel English\u2019s \u2018More Like You\u2019 and we were impressed by the clarity of the different sonic layers and frequencies.\u00a0We also tested them with some synthy pop in the form of Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201824K Magic\u2019, and we were pleasantly surprised by the forcefulness of the bass - enough to make you want to tap your foot, but not so much that it overpowers the vocals and keys.There\u2019s ambient noise cancellation at play as well as noise isolation, which we found to be quite effective at drowning out a fair level of environmental noise, in everywhere from the office to noisy trains.Although Mobvoi claims the earbuds themselves will last for four hours from a single charge, we found it was closer to three - and that was without music constantly playing.To get that much juice you'll have to charge them for 40 minutes, but the wireless charging case itself offers an extra 14 hours too and it comes with fast-charging built-in as well, which is great if you\u2019re on the go.\u00a0That's not as good as the AirPods, which we found last for five hours from a single charge, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the TicPods Free are cheaper.The TicPods Free offer everything that makes the rival true wireless headphones great, but here it's for a slightly lower price and the big benefit is its much wider compatibility.The audio quality was impressive, and although guitars sometimes sounded a little grainy, it\u2019s a small price to pay for the amount of sonic power you get with these in-ears.\u00a0Of course, in-ear headphones are unlikely to appeal to true audiophiles as they are rarely as good as high-end over-ears, but if you\u2019re a casual listener, the TicPods Free will do just fine.It\u2019s pretty clear that the TicPods Free were designed to look like the Apple AirPods, and if that\u2019s a style you like, these earbuds will probably suit you down to the ground.We found they were fairly comfortable to wear - although if your ears are on the smaller side, you may find the casing digs into the conch part of your ear after a while.\u00a0The fact you can still use these on your iPhone, as well as Android phones, makes the TicPods Free a great alternative to the Apple AirPods and the audio quality, design and battery life all add up to make a good product in its own right.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
