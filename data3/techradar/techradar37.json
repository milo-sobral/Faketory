{"id": "TechRadar proThe death of net neutrality and the rise of VPNs", "paragraph": "\nBy\nAriel Hochstadt\n2018-10-24T14:30:32Z\n\nVPN\n\u00a0\n\nWith the coroner officially declaring Net Neutrality dead back in June, (at least as far as the FCC is concerned), the average user is no longer protected from Internet throttling. ISP\u2019s can now slow down consumers\u2019 Internet access without restriction, meaning all users streaming Netflix or YouTube videos could suddenly find their Internet \u201cthrottled\u201d by their ISP, impacting the speed of downloads or ability to watch in higher resolutions, to incentivize the paid prioritization models many are expecting.In the new Internet age ushered in by Ajit Pai and the FCC, consumers are at a severe disadvantage, and ultimately at the mercy of their providers. Under the new rules, consumers could find \u00a0their favorite content \u2013 especially videos\u2013 slow to a crawl, as slow as your cell phone internet after you\u2019ve \u201crun out of data\u201d for the month. Of course, ISPs will offer to fix that \u2013 for a price. Which seems unfair, since they are already charging consumers for their services.While it has not happened yet, the potential for this type of reality is certainly possible as the repeal of net neutrality means ISPs are free to do whatever they wish with regards to our internet (and they don\u2019t even owe us any explanations because it would be totally legal). Given this possibility, consumers need a way to balance the asymmetric relationship they now share with their service providers.\u00a0Enter the VPN, the simple tool that could prove to be the solution to ISP throttling. By keeping the content a user is accessing away from the prying eyes of the ISP, users can practically guarantee themselves a smooth, satisfying \u2013 and even speedy \u2013 content experience at the their favorite sites.VPNs mask the online activity of those who use them by encrypting web traffic, thus preventing ISPs (or anyone else) from seeing where a user is connecting to. If ISPs don't recognize a user's activity to a site, they can't \u201cregulate\u201d their traffic to that site. Thus when they connect to the sites ISPs are targeting for throttling, they get in \u201cunder the wire,\u201d and are able to surf, watch, and interact with any site without experiencing a slowdown.But won't ISPs still notice that a customer is still using a great deal of bandwidth? Even if they can't see that a user has connected to a specific \u201cheavy content\u201d site that would be on their list of \u201cregulated sites\u201d (Netflix, for example, is probably on that list), the large amount of bandwidth is likely to set off an alarm. Fortunately, many VPNs can compress data downloaded from a site, lowering data consumption rates \u2013 and better concealing from the ISP that a user is bypassing their throttling protocols. Other benefits of VPN-encrypted connections include blocking ads, and enabling users to get around geographic restrictions, which prevents content from being seen in certain countries.Of course, some VPNs are better than others; criteria for deciding on which ones to use depends on how many servers a service has, where the servers are located, how robust the servers are, etc. Good VPNs use high-security encryption tools, like Internet protocol security protocol (IPSec) and its associated tools, including Security associations (SA), Internet key exchange (IKE), Perfect forward secrecy (PFS), Authentication header (AH) and all the other backend security technologies that are deployed to keep consumers a step ahead ISPs, while the free VPN\u2019s may simply provide the bare minimum and become less relevant fairly quickly as ISPs adapt.Consumers need to do some research before deciding (NordVPN, ExpressVPN and Hotspot Shield have been the market leaders over the past year). But the principle holds; ISPs do not provide their services for free, but consumers deserve choice in their surfing habits and should not let their providers slow down their surfing \u201cfor the greater good\u201d of internet bandwidth. If users access their favorite sites via VPNs, they can avoid throttling issues \u2013 and get \u201cfull service\u201d from the sites they want, not the ones ISPs want to direct them to.The repeal of net neutrality has indeed delivered consumers a new problem to contend with, and as usual, it is up to consumers to safeguard their own interests \u2013 to ensure they get what they want as the two forces duke it out. With VPNs, will be able to tip the balance of power in this now asymmetric relationship back in their favor and avoid getting caught up in the economics or politics of the players involved in this bandwidth battle.Ariel Hochstadt is cofounder of vpnMentor\u00a0Techradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
