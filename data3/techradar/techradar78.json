{"id": "TechRadar proUse this checklist to find a VPN you can trust", "paragraph": "\nBy\nAnthony Spadafora\n2018-11-02T14:55:15Z\n\nVPN\n\u00a0\n\nEarlier this year the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) met with several popular VPN providers, including ExpressVPN, at RightsCon in Toronto, Canada.\u00a0There the companies and the non-profit organisation worked together to formulate a list of questions that describe the basic commitments VPNs can make to signal their trustworthiness and reputation called the Signals of Trustworthy VPNs.To learn more about this partnership and how it aims to improve transparency among VPN providers, TechRadar Pro sat down with ExpressVPN\u2019s Vice President Harold Li.The Center for Democracy & Technology is a non-profit organization that advocates for laws, policies, and tools that protect the rights of internet users. We\u2019ve developed a strong relationship with them given that we both share a passion for privacy, free expression, and the the power of the internet. The CDT has long been a trusted neutral expert on the VPN industry\u2014perhaps best known for filing an FTC complaint against a VPN provider for its alleged data-logging practices and deceptive privacy policy.We support and work with a number of different digital rights advocacy organizations, including the EFF, Fight for the Future, OpenMedia, CDT, and others. In this case, the CDT initiated this effort due to their longrunning interest in helping consumers identify VPN providers that they can trust.VPNs are a vital tool for anyone who cares about the privacy and security online, but actually choosing a provider that you can trust can be a daunting task. With dozens of providers to choose from, it\u2019s easy for people to be overwhelmed or even to give up, leaving themselves vulnerable. This initiative provides important guidance, supported by an independent third-party, for consumers to evaluate which provider they can trust.\u00a0I like to describe it as a nutrition label for VPNs, providing a baseline set of facts you can compare across various services, helping everyone choose the right VPN for their privacy and security. And just as a nutrition label can help you determine which peanut butter labeled \u201chealthy\u201d truly is better for you, these questions and answers enable you to better judge whether a VPN service that boasts \u201cindustry-leading security\u201d truly deserves that label.Absolutely, this initiative just establishes a baseline for what we consider trustworthy VPN providers should do and disclose. At ExpressVPN, we believe that we can do a lot more to earn user trust, such as through our track record of advocacy for digital rights and support for associated organizations, innovation in the industry such as our open-source leak testing tool suite, and sharing detailed information about how we work every day to protect our users. The ExpressVPN Trust Center, for example, features extensive additional detail about our security practices, above and beyond what the CDT project calls for.\u00a0The other VPN providers who have joined the initiative so far are IVPN, Mullvad, TunnelBear, and Vypr. There\u2019s absolutely an open invite for anyone to participate in this project. We want to raise the bar for security and privacy practices in the consumer VPN industry as a whole, so the more participants the better!A VPN industry with higher standards and better informed consumers ultimately means a more secure and private internet for everyone\u2014and I certainly hope that any VPN provider can agree with that goal. VPNs looking to join the scheme should reach out to the CDT.Harold Li, Vice President of ExpressVPN\u00a0Techradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
