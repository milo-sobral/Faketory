This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy.\u201d\u201cUsers should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t. Anything less is a sham.\u201dTechradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
