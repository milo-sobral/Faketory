That's especially true of PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition. \u00a0PNY\u2019s premium version of the extremely capable GeForce RTX 2080 Ti undoubtedly runs cooler and a tick faster than Nvidia\u2019s own version. Unfortunately, outside of incredibly overclocking potential, these small improvements make it hard to justify its noticeably higher price.\u00a0If you thought the Founders Edition version of the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti was setting the high bar for pricing at $1,199 (\u00a31,099, AU$1,899), the PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition comes priced at an even higher $1,399 or \u00a31,329 (about AU$1,950) price.\u00a0At this point, we\u2019re well above doubling the price of the last generation Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition that went for $699 (\u00a3669, AU$1,129) \u2013 and even higher than the $1,199 (\u00a31,149, AU$1,950) Nvidia Titan Xp.\u00a0What demands such a high price you might ask? Well not a lot on paper, unfortunately. \u00a0The PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition specs are identical to that of the Founders Edition. Of course, we weren\u2019t expecting more CUDA cores, ray tracing cores or Tensor cores, but even the smallest bump in Boost Clocks would make this GPU more unique. \u00a0This XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition at the very least introduces a much more significant cooling system with an extra fan over the Founders Edition. The two heatsinks on this card is also massive and extend nearly an inch and a half past the component\u2019s printed circuit board. Taking a closer look at dual heatsink, you can\u2019t but help to admire the array of overlapping copper heat pipes inside as well.\u00a0All of this attention spent on thermals pays off with a cooler running and better performing card \u2013 even if only slightly so \u2013 as you\u2019ll soon see.\u00a0One other thing we\u2019ll note about the look of the card is that it doesn\u2019t feature any RGB lighting whatsoever. Those of you averse to making their PC glow with rainbow hues might be happy about it, but it seems odd to pay more card that doesn\u2019t light up at, especially when other GPUs in this price bracket revel in being lit AF.\u00a0CPU: 3.7Ghz Intel Core i7-8700K (hexa-core, 12MB cache, up to 4.7GHz)RAM: 32GB Vengeance LED DDR4 (3,200MHz) Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z370-E Gaming Power Supply: Corsair RM850x Storage: 512GB Samsung 960 Pro M.2 SSD (NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4) Cooling: Thermaltake Floe Riing 360 TT Premium Edition Case: Corsair Crystal Series 570X RGB Operating system: Windows 10\u00a0Despite being pretty much identical to the Founders Edition version of the RTX 2080 Ti, the PNY RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition makes a statement by outperforming the former. In almost every one of our benchmarks, this XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition comes out on top, even if only by a very slim lead.\u00a0Undoubtedly, the heat sink helps to keep the PNY RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition performing in top shape as the card runs two-degrees cooler than the Founders Edition both at idle and full load.\u00a0This greater cooling capacity really comes into play when you overclock it. Turning up the RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 OC with PNY\u2019s VelocityX Overclocking Software is a bit challenging and tedious, but ultimately doable for most users.We nearly achieved a 1,850MHz overclock, but getting there requires a lot of teasing out voltage increases and tuning memory speed.\u00a0By now we hoped to use Nvidia\u2019s NV Scanner API, which introduces Tensor Core-driven and AI-powered overclocking. Unfortunately, the VelocityX Overclocking Software doesn\u2019t feature that yet, but PNY tells us its software is always changing and it hopes to integrate all of Nvidia\u2018s tools soon.\u00a0The PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Ti XLR8 Gaming Overclocked Edition is a graphics card all about taking Nvidia GeForce RTX to the edge. This is the best performing version of any GeForce RTX 2080 Ti we\u2019ve tested so far, but it should only really be considered by overclockers looking for a card that keeps its cool.\u00a0For users looking to buy a just buy a new graphics card to plug into their gaming PC, there are more affordable versions including Nvidia \u2018s own Founders Edition.\u00a0Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
