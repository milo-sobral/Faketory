Awards, held in September and October of each year.For the 2018 awards, 102 products walked away with a trophy \u2013 including some of our favorite products, like the Sony HT-ST5000 Soundbar and the Beyerdynamic Amiron \u2013 with top accolades going to the LG C8 OLED for Best 55-inch TV and 65-inch TV \u00a0under \u00a32,500 and the Sony WH-1000XM3 for Best Wireless Headphones over \u00a3300.Unsurprisingly, audio manufacturers Rega and Chord swept the turntable and DAC categories, respectively, with Panasonic's new DP-UB9000 winning an award for Best 4K Blu-ray player over \u00a3500.While the awards are generally separated by price, one product in each of the categories will be awarded a Product of the Year trophy in-person at the annual What Hi-Fi?
