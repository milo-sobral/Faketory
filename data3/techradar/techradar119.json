In the UK specifically, advertisers saw a staggering 199% increase in orders, driven by key retail sectors including apparel and accessories.It\u2019s an astonishing opportunity for businesses around the world, not least those based in the UK. Pioneers such as Burberry have already realised huge growth in digital sales through the APAC region, with Chinese tourists contributing a significant lift in Hong Kong, Korea and Japan.Despite all this, recent research indicates UK businesses are missing out almost entirely, with 74% of marketing professionals focused on the local market. Rather than focus on Singles\u2019 Day, which draws the attention of one in ten marketers, brands instead choose to keep campaigns constant through the year at the expense of any major seasonal peaks.\u2018Always on\u2019 marketing, where teams are working consistently around the calendar year to offer online promotions and in-store discounts, is built around\u00a0local\u00a0consumer behaviour\u00a0and a growing trend in early holiday shopping.\u00a0According to the report, Guess Who...Unwrapping the Global Holiday Gift Shopper, two of the most dominant shopper profiles in the UK are the \u2018Early Bird Shopper\u2019 (18%), planning up to a year ahead,\u00a0and\u00a0the \u2018Sporadic Shopper\u2019 (23%) who buys gifts throughout the year.\u00a0However, this approach leaves some of the fastest growing, most lucrative opportunities untapped. In Britain alone, as many as 35% of transactions driven for Rakuten Marketing clients are now taking place overseas.\u202fMarketing teams must\u202fstart focusing on these demographics and\u202fcarrying out\u202fthorough research into local consumer behaviour and trends to inform campaigns.China is home to the world\u2019s largest retail market, generating nearly $5 trillion in total retail sales in 2017, representing 53.1% of sales in Asia-Pacific (APAC).\u00a0On top of this, marketers have an overwhelmingly positive outlook on the potential for growth in overseas markets. Nearly two-thirds of UK marketers believe their target customers outside of the UK are wealthier, younger and more digitally savvy.This sentiment is highest among marketers targeting Asia-Pacific where 82% confirm they see their customer base in the region as \u2018premium buyers\u2019.Why then, have so few businesses made the leap? Put simply, just one in ten businesses have local marketing teams in overseas markets able to carry the responsibility for the international roll-out of campaigns.\u00a0Tapping the APAC market certainly isn\u2019t easy. There are plenty of nuances Western brands must get their heads around to launch products with any success.\u00a0A great example is bulk buying; a phenomenon whereby an individual Chinese shopper will place multiple orders of the same products for friends who can\u2019t get hold of a credit card \u2013 behaviour that could be misinterpreted as reseller activity.To reach customers in the lucrative Chinese market, many businesses will use this time of year as an opportunity to trial promotions and offers to see what best works for the brand.\u00a0Among retailers that have previously participated in Singles\u2019 Day, one of the most valuable assets at their disposal is their data. All businesses in this position must be reviewing the performance of previous years\u2019 campaigns to get a sense of what worked and what didn\u2019t, and use this information as a means for shaping Singles\u2019 Day strategy.A large part of this involves working out the publishers and platforms most appropriate for the brand to use. Some UK marketers are increasingly using platforms such as the messaging app, WeChat: 36% have used the platform personally. Similarly, 30% have tried the microblogging website Weibo and 18% have tried the social network\u00a0Renren.\u00a0Similarly, concierge apps are among the most popular platforms used by consumers in China to make shopping from international sites simple. These apps make it easier for international retailers to engage and convert Chinese consumers by translating a brand\u2019s website, working with third party logistic companies and allowing consumers to purchase with Alipay or WeChatPay.Withdrawal from seasonal marketing peaks doesn\u2019t just mean missed APAC opportunities. Today, just 16% of UK businesses are focused on the international Western shopping peak that is Cyber Week \u2013 this is almost half of the proportion of businesses looking to leverage the peak in US.Instead of shying from the international stage, it\u2019s time\u00a0for UK brands to invest\u00a0in seasonal marketing campaigns\u00a0and\u00a0Singles\u2019 Day\u00a0is no exception.\u00a0Our research also shows APAC shoppers are\u00a0actually far\u00a0more likely to visit the brand site itself as part of the online journey than their Western counterparts, allowing teams the opportunity to start small, measure and evolve their\u00a0strategy.\u00a0Anthony Capano is Managing Director EMEA, Rakuten Marketing\u00a0Techradar Pro has teamed up with GoDaddy to produce a website-hosting tips eBook, looking at how to plan your website, picking the right domain name and great ways to promote your website.TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
