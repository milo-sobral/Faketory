But while the sheer scale of the giant open-world Western game may be daunting to some, it looks like we'll be getting a bit of help from the developers along the way.A blog post by Rockstar Games announced the official Red Dead Redemption 2 Companion App for iOS and Android devices, which will connect directly to your PS4 or Xbox One console while running the game.\u00a0The free app will show up the in-game map, and allow you to \"set waypoints or mark areas of interest with a tap on your screen, aiding your exploration and discovery through the expansive world of Red Dead Redemption 2\".\u00a0You can also use the smartphone / tablet app to read your in-game journal, display character stats and information in real-time, and even remove the game's HUD from the TV entirely for a more cinematic feel.The announcement comes in the midst of increased scrutiny of Rockstar's working practices, after reports of 100-hour working weeks for members of staff at peak periods in Red Dead Redemption 2's development.The companion app is likely to prove a boon to gamers wanting a more immersive experience with Red Dead Redemption 2 \u2013 seeing as it can separate the more technical stats and navigation features of the game from the visual gameplay \u2013 though we doubt you'll miss it if you decide to go without.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
