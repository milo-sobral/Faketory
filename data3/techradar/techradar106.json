After such a close game, you can expect England to be well and truly fired up. Facing the brunt of the come-back force in the next rugby union autumn international is Japan. You can watch the full match, no matter where you are in the world, with an England vs Japan live stream \u2013 and you're in the right place to find out how.England and Japan meet at the home of English rugby, Twickenham Stadium on Saturday, November 17.\u00a0Kick-off is at 3pm GMT in West London, so that's 10am ET, 7am PT, 2am Sunday AEDT, and midnight in Tokyo.The weekend's match represents the penultimate England game of the autumn internationals before taking on Australia, and then attentions are turned to the Six Nations and next year's rugby World Cup.\u00a0The really interesting part about this clash with Japan is that England have played them on just one occasion before. This was in the inaugural Rugby World Cup way back in 1987. England won then, but Japan are a rather different prospect these days.The England line-up will see some changes for this match. Bath's 21-year-old winger Joe Cokanasiga, for example, will make his England debut against Japan. George Ford and Maro Itoje are in the starting line-up with the likes of Sam Underhill and Owen Farrell lined up as replacements on Eddie Jones' team (against his old side, of course).If you want to tune into the action live, you're in the right place.
