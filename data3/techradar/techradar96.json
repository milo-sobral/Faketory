{"id": "TechRadarWhatsApp 2.18 update brings stickers in chat, here's how to customise your own", "paragraph": "\nBy\nMalavika Subramanyan\n2018-11-12T11:53:14Z\n\nApplications\n\u00a0\n\nFacebook-owned instant messaging platform, WhatsApp, now has a Stickers feature in its new version. Version 2.18 shows a third icon next to the emoji and GIF menus; that\u2019s your new sticker library.The app comes pre-loaded with \u2018Cuppy\u2019 stickers- true to the name, it\u2019s a teacup frozen in a number of strong emotions. At the top right corner of the window is a \u2018+\u2019 icon, which takes you to a library of sticker series that you can pick and choose from. \u00a0If you\u2019re particularly finicky about the quality of your picture-reply (and for some reason gifs and memes don\u2019t cut it), you can scroll to the bottom of the page and\u2026 get even more stickers. That option takes you to the Play Store/App Store; specifically to a page full of search results for \u2018WAStickerApps\u2019. Most of these are free, fun, and pretty creative, actually!You can even create your own stickers using just your phone. It\u2019s an easy process; all you need is a working internet connection.Step 1: Make the goofy/exasperated/grossed-out/crazy face you want, and take a few selfies. Make sure you take at least three, though, as Sticker packs on WhatsApp have a minimum requirement of three images.Step 2: Download any background eraser app from the store. I\u2019m going with the one from MediaCoding.inc because\u2026 no reason, really. It\u2019s the first one I saw.Step 3: Erase the background from your new selfies, and save them. Take a quick trip to the gallery folder to check that they\u2019re saved as .png files- that\u2019s important. WhatsApp stickers only allow for that file type.Step 4: Now, \u00a0go back to the Play Store (or App Store, I don\u2019t judge), and download the \u2018Personal Stickers for WhatsApp\u2019 app. It\u2019s by a developer called Stukalov.Step 5: When you open the app, it\u2019ll automatically detects the files you\u2019ve created, and you\u2019ll have to add it by tapping the button to the right saying \u2018Add\u2019.Step 6: Tap Add on the dialog box that pops up as well.Now swipe over to WhatsApp and open your Stickers. You should see a new little library right next to Cuppy.\u00a0So there you have it- the definitive eight-step method to sticker creation for WhatsApp. These days, with smartphones and the internet, everyone\u2019s a creator.
