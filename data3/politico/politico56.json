But we know that health care is not a privilege in America. Health care is a right in America, and that is why I\u2019m running.\u201dStory Continued BelowGeorgia\u2019s neck-and-neck governor\u2019s race is one of at least half a dozen where a Democrat supporting Medicaid expansion has a fighting chance to replace a Republican who opposes it. Competitive races in Florida, Wisconsin, Kansas, Oklahoma and South Dakota could also flip the status of holdout states that have so far refused Obamacare's Medicaid expansion \u2014 though Republican legislatures are not likely to make it easy.In addition, Maine voters who overwhelmingly backed expansion in 2017 will choose between a Republican who vows to continue departing Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s crusade to block Medicaid\u2019s implementation and a Democrat who says she will immediately enact it. Four more states deep in Trump country \u2014 Idaho, Utah, Nebraska and Montana \u2014 have Medicaid expansion questions on their ballots; in Montana\u2019s case, whether to continue their legislature-approved expansion.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

All told, the races could expand eligibility to nearly 3 million people without health coverage. In Georgia alone, nearly half a million uninsured, low-income adults could join the rolls, many of them residents of rural, Republican-controlled counties. Abrams, formerly the state House minority leader, has put expansion front and center, calling it her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201dAs she crosses the state in a brightly painted campaign bus, Abrams sometimes makes a \u201cGeorgia first\u201d argument, noting that billions of residents' tax dollars are helping fund other states\u2019 expansions, and promising to bring those dollars \u201cback home\u201d by taking federal funding that will cover the lion's share of the added coverage. Other times, she zeroes in on the high number of uninsured Georgians using emergency rooms for primary care, which, she points out, puts a strain on local budgets that could be alleviated by expanding Medicaid.Standing on a basketball court in conservative-leaning Monroe, an hour east of Atlanta, Abrams made a deeply personal argument. She spoke about her younger brother\u2019s years of struggle with a drug addiction and undiagnosed bipolar disorder \u2014 and how he got the treatment he needed only after he went to jail. He struggled to find a job with health coverage once released and wound up relapsing.\u201cUntil we expand Medicaid, Walter will not be entitled to the very type of health care that he needs to keep him safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to have our sheriffs and police chiefs arresting folks because they can\u2019t get the medicine they need for their mental health challenges.\u201d Abrams\u2019 opponent, Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, has staked out the opposite position on Medicaid expansion. In the first debate of the race, he warned that taking the federal funding would be the first step on a slippery slope to single-payer universal health care.\u201cMs. Abrams supports a government takeover of health care,\u201d Kemp charged. \u201cIt\u2019s a plan that will make your current insurance illegal. You will not be able to choose who your doctor is.\u201dKemp has also argued Georgia cannot afford to expand Medicaid. Even though the federal government will pick up 90 percent of the tab, the state would need to invest more than $200 million a year, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\u201cRepublicans are taking a longer view of health-care costs, saying that while we may make money on Medicaid expansion in the first couple years, they\u2019re worried about the years further out and the impact on the state budget,\u201d said Jimmy Lewis, the CEO of Hometown Health, a rural hospital network in Georgia. \u201cWhen you get entitlements to grow, they never shrink, and they could get out of control.\u201d\nElections\n                    By RACHAEL BADE and JOHN BRESNAHANMost voters in the state, however, appear to agree with Abrams. A poll conducted earlier this year by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 73 percent of Georgians want to expand Medicaid, including 51 percent of Republicans. An October poll by SurveyUSA found majorities in every age, gender, race and political affiliation favor expansion.The state of Georgia\u2019s health care system may be fueling that sentiment.Eight rural hospitals have shut their doors in the last decade, and more than half of the state\u2019s remaining ones are vulnerable, according to the National Rural Health Association. Sixty-three of the state's 159 counties lack a pediatrician, while nine have no doctor of any kind. One of the poorest counties in the state, desperate for access to a health care provider, recently dipped into its public school funding to open a clinic.\u201cThe situation is getting dire,\u201d said Monty Veazey, president of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals. \u201cWe have more and more uninsured people going into our ERs every year. One of our rural hospitals had to pay for $140 million in uncompensated care last year alone.\u201dVeazey, a Democrat who previously served three terms in the Georgia House, said he believes Medicaid expansion would help tremendously. He pointed to the impact expansion has had in nearby Kentucky, where the rate of uninsured residents dropped to just over 5 percent, compared to Georgia\u2019s 13.4 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that is going to keep hospitals from closing and give people access to health care,\u201d he told POLITICO.Still, with at least one of Georgia\u2019s legislative chambers likely to remain Republican and most GOP lawmakers hostile to the idea, Abrams will not be able to expand Medicaid \u201con Day 1,\u201d as she has promised.Asked about that hurdle during a recent debate, Abrams said she was confident she could persuade skeptical officials.\u201cI spent 11 years in the state legislature, seven as Democratic leader and I know how to work across the aisle,\u201d she said, adding that if Vice President Mike Pence could embrace expansion while he was governor of Indiana, anything is possible. The state\u2019s medical industry is less confident.\u201cI think in the short term, they would remain opposed,\u201d Veazy said of the GOP-controlled legislature. \u201cThey always bring up the money the state would have to put up, but there\u2019s a stigma too. It\u2019s an intangible attitude of, \u2018We\u2019re funding a population that[doesn\u2019t] ... work. It\u2019s another entitlement program.\u2019\u201d Other pro-expansion gubernatorial candidates could face similar roadblocks if they win their races.\nelections\n                    By MAGGIE SEVERNS and LORRAINE WOELLERTIn Wisconsin, where Democrats are on the cusp of unseating Gov. Scott Walker, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has already vowed to oppose any effort to expand Medicaid.But like Abrams, Democratic nominee Tony Evers, says he\u2019s confident he can move the ball forward.\u201cIt\u2019s easy \u2026 in the political time of an election to make comments like that,\u201d Evers told POLITICO after a recent rally in Milwaukee. \u201cI feel confident going forward we will be able to work with the legislature to make that happen. We have to get those resources, and we\u2019re going to get it.\"Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, agreed, telling POLITICO, saying a decisive win in November would put pressure on Republicans to compromise.\u201cThere will be a mandate if we win this election that Medicaid expansion is the right way to go for this state, and Vos will have to deal with those consequences,\u201d Barnes told reporters in Madison.Abrams and her allies have vowed to bring similar pressure to bear in Georgia if she wins.Tamika Middleton, a lead organizer of a cadre of home health care aides and other domestic workers that has mobilized for Abrams, told POLITICO she sees a major attitude shift toward taking federal funding to expand coverage.\u201cWe\u2019re in such a health care crisis right now that they can no longer avoid the question,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see some cracks in the opposition to Medicaid expansion.\u201dDavid Siders contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?
