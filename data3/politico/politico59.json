Government officials who wrote that timetable for enacting the 2 percent tax in the British budget plan expect others to soon follow. The U.S. tech industry isn\u2019t pleased.Story Continued Below\u201cIn his final budget statement before the U.K. leaves the EU next March, Chancellor Philip Hammond jumped ahead of European Union policymakers and the 36-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which are also drawing up proposals, by setting out his own timeline for a new tax that appears to be aimed squarely at the likes of tech behemoths Google, Facebook and Amazon,\u201d our Annabelle Dickson reports from London.The U.K. digital tax would kick in the same year the OECD is supposed to finish an agreement on taxing digital service platforms. Industry opponents and U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have urged a pause to allow that multilateral process to play out before countries act on their own. Hammond said the U.K. would continue working with the OECD and Group of 20 nations and drop the tax if an appropriate international solution emerges. The tax would also be subject to a formal review in 2025, the Treasury said.The mechanics look simple. The tax, which differs from an online sales tax, would apply to revenues from the use of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces from users in the U.K. In a nod to concerns that it could stifle innovation, the tax would only hit profitable businesses with global sales that exceed \u00a3500 million, or about $640 million, and tech companies\u2019 first \u00a325 million of U.K. revenues is exempt. Policymakers don\u2019t want to drive the sector out of Britain after Brexit, especially after Google and Facebook announced multibillion-pound investments in London, arguably Europe's biggest tech hub.The U.K. tax could yield an estimated \u00a3400 million a year. In March, European Commission officials proposed a 3 percent tax on digital commerce revenues, which they said could generate an estimated 5 billion euros or $5.7 billion annually for member states. The French are pushing to get it adopted across the board by the end of this year despite opposition in a handful of countries, led by Ireland, and rumored reluctance in Germany.While companies are more than concerned about the tax spreading globally, tech trade associations in the U.S. and U.K. warned of the industry being undermined in Britain in the near term. In addition, the National Foreign Trade Council in the U.S. said American companies could be disproportionately affected and that it could ultimately interfere with U.K. trade commitments, potentially endangering future trade relations. But London has signaled it\u2019s leading. As Annabelle writes, one Treasury official said they were \u201ctreading softly to start with\u201d and hoped it would \u201cencourage other countries to act too.\u201dWELCOME TO TUESDAY from Morning Tax, where we\u2019re a week away from midterm elections.

John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who stands to be the next House Budget Committee chairman should his party take control of the chamber. He told our Jennifer Scholtes he expects proposals to boost the rate to 25 percent or 27 percent from the new level of 21 percent, given how little benefit has flowed to employees and reinvestment from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). \u201cIt was $775 billion worth of stock buybacks,\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cIt was not really what was promised.\u201dRepublicans last year used the reconciliation budget maneuver to prevent Senate Democrats from halting passage of the new law. Yarmuth, who said the budget panel would explore whether tax cuts can pay for themselves, foreshadowed the likelihood of pushing for more revenue through corporate taxes. \u201cAnd the only way we can do that is through reconciliation,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s not likely Republicans would agree to such a plan if they retain Senate control, much less President Donald Trump.CLARITY COMING? The Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s technical explainer on the new tax cuts law, called the Blue Book, should emerge by the end of the year, a staffer said at an American Bar Association meeting. JCT Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold has said he prefers it come out before the absolute end of the year. \u201cSo that basically means soon,\u201d said Veena Murthy, JCT legislation counsel, according to Tax Notes. The JCT generally releases its Blue Books at the end of each Congress with explanations of enacted tax legislation, though they sometimes are issued annually, too. WHISTLEBLOWER ADVOCACY: The IRS needs to improve how it rewards whistleblowers who flag violations on Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) reports, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. New law requires the IRS to include FBAR penalties in calculating whistleblower awards, but that wasn\u2019t previously the case, and GAO found that IRS awards could have been $3.2 million more between January 2012 and July 2017. \u201cFor the IRS whistleblower program to be successful, whistleblowers need to have confidence in the program\u2019s processes and outcomes, including paying awards when a whistleblower\u2019s information is used,\u201d the report said. The IRS agreed with the recommendations.TAX HIKE EYED ON TOP INCOMES: Taxes would rise on top earners in Colombia under a new proposal that would also trim the corporate tax. The income tax on upper earners would increase to between 35 percent and 37 percent from 33 percent now, depending on salaries, Reuters reported. Taxes on corporate income would be lowered to 30 percent from the current 33 percent. The plan would also extend the country\u2019s value-added tax. It faces an uphill battle for passage in Colombia\u2019s legislature.CARBON TAX KERFUFFLE: Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau was on the carbon tax defensive, worrying that his opponents want to \u201cmake pollution free again,\u201d CTV News reported. Trudeau\u2019s critics aren\u2019t serious about broader climate change problems and lack a strategy to address the issue, so they fall back on attacking the carbon tax, he said. \u201cWhat the critics all have in common is that they want you to think that it\u2019s OK to have no real plan at all,\u201d Trudeau said.RUNAWAY SUBSIDY: Wisconsin\u2019s expanding subsidy for the Taiwanese company Foxconn has now reached some $4.1 billion, according to the Verge, up from an initially forecast $3 billion. At the same time, Foxconn has cut back its job creation promises. Originally thought to be central to GOP Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s latest reelection bid, the deal could end up hurting him. \u201cPolls now show most Wisconsin voters don\u2019t believe the subsidy will pay off for taxpayers, and Walker didn\u2019t even mention the deal in a November 2017 speech announcing his run for re-election,\u201d the story said.PROPERTY TAX PROPOSAL: New property taxes could soon hit Utah residents in Salt Lake County. The potential increase is scheduled for consideration at a budget hearing next month of the Greater Salt Lake Municipal Services District, which manages services in the county\u2019s five metro townships and unincorporated areas, according to the Deseret News. Some 90,000 residents could face the new tax \u201cto help fund road repairs and maintenance,\u201d with a separate new stormwater fee also under consideration.
