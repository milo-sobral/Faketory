Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) about the 2020 campaign, Sanders said, \"No, not really.\"An aide to Warren did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

At least three senators \u2014 Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren (D-Mass.) and Merkley \u2014 are likely to compete for many of the same hard-left supporters Sanders drew in 2016. Sanders touched off a nine-state midterm election tour on Friday, while Warren has been aggressively preparing for a 2020 launch. Other Democrats, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), have taken steps to advance tax and other policy proposals appealing to progressive Democrats.The jockeying among progressive candidates has sparked worry among some hard-left activists, who fear they could split the vote in the 2020 primary, ceding ground to a more moderate Democrat.\u201cI hope\u00a0there will be serious\u00a0conversations between Sens. Sanders and Warren, and perhaps Sen.\u00a0Merkley,\u201d Jeff Cohen, co-founder of the online activist group RootsAction.org. \u201cI\u00a0think I speak for many progressives who dominate the Democratic Party\u00a0base when I say we'd like to see\u00a0one genuine\u00a0progressive in the race and\u00a0not two or three splitting the vote.\u201dIt's unclear what any pre-election meeting would accomplish. Politicians more typically agree to sit out elections at lower rungs of government, where ingratiating oneself to the party establishment can result in support seeking an alternative office. It is far rarer for a presidential aspirant to check his or her ambitions.But a pre-2020 agreement would not necessarily require any candidate to immediately step aside. Instead, candidates could discuss benchmarks \u2014 fundraising, polling or early primary performance \u2014 and at what point progressive candidates would throw their support to a fellow progressive in the race.\nElections \n                    By DAVID SIDERSLarry Cohen, a former head of the Communications Workers of America who now chairs the board of Our Revolution, a political offshoot of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign,\u00a0said the large crowds Sanders drew on Friday in Indiana and Michigan were evidence that Sanders\u2019 \u201cmessage continues to be unique, and resonates with younger voters and their concerns with economic justice.\u201d\u201cIt is important that if there are other similar candidates in the 2020 presidential nominating campaign, that they support each other at least in minimal ways, or that they support each other as much as possible so that one of them is the nominee,\u201d Cohen added.Sanders demurred when asked to expand on any potential pre-2020 conversation with other progressives.\u201cWe'll see what will happen,\" Sanders said. \"I don't know what will happen. Of course, I speak to Elizabeth [Warren] almost every day. ... We will see what happens.\u201dHe said, \u201cThe major issue right now is, I think, for progressives to expose Trump for the fraud that he is, and to come up with an agenda that makes sense to working families.\"In 2016, Merkley was Sanders\u2019 only fellow senator to endorse his presidential campaign. But the party has shifted left since the last presidential election, drawing closer to Sanders' positions on health care and college affordability. Earlier this week, Harris proposed a new tax break for average Americans, calling for a $6,000 tax credit for families earning up to $100,000.The clamoring on the left has encouraged longtime progressives, including Sanders, who said that in his failed run for president in 2016, \u201cI think we opened up the door for people to understand that the American people want real change.\u201d\npolitics\n                    By ALEX THOMPSON , NATASHA KORECKI and CHRISTOPHER CADELAGONow, Sanders said, \u201cYou\u2019re seeing candidates coming up with ideas to try to address those issues.\u201d\u201cIn a sense,\" he said, President Donald Trump \"has helped us, because he has said that deficits don\u2019t matter, that you can give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. And that opens the door, I think, for progressives to start saying we\u2019re going to use the federal government to protect the interests of working families, not just the people on top.\u201dAny effort by progressive candidates to coordinate ahead of the 2020 campaign could backfire, with many Sanders supporters still seething over his treatment by establishment Democrats in 2016.In 2020, \u201cIt\u2019s to the advantage of progressives in the party not to have the appearance of smoke-filled rooms,\" said Norman Solomon, who in 2016 coordinated the group \"Bernie Delegates Network,\" which operated independently of his campaign. Daily Kos national community organizer Chris Reeves, a Democratic National Committee member from Kansas, said the field of progressive candidates in 2020 will likely be winnowed naturally, anyway, by donors and in primary debates. And with Trump in office, he suggested intraparty friction over ideology will be less prominent in 2020.\u201cI would take a ham sandwich on rye over Trump,\u201d he said.Missing out on the latest scoops?
