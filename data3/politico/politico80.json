Mueller is investigating whether any Americans had advance knowledge of the email dump, which dominated the final weeks of the campaign. Corsi called the impending indictment the result of a \u201cperjury trap,\u201c though he emphasized that he wasn\u2018t totally sure what the indictment might be for. Corsi\u2018s attorney declined to comment. Corsi also repeatedly emphasized his continued support for Trump\u2018s presidency and urged backers to send him money for his legal defense. \u201cI think my crime, really, is supporting Donald Trump,\u201c he said, in between long rants about voter fraud and suggesting that Democrats intend to overthrow Trump. \nCongress\n                    By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSCorsi said prosecutors showed up at his house on Aug. 28, just before his 72nd birthday, and presented a subpoena. He said he didn\u2018t talk to them at the time. But later, with his lawyer present, Corsi said, he met multiple times with Mueller\u2018s team in Washington. He recalled prosecutors Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein being present.Corsi also said he was raising money for his legal defense.His hourlong remarks meandered among various conspiracy theories, suggesting \u201ccriminals\u201c were running the Justice Department and that Democrats were seeking to \u201coverthrow\u201c Trump. \u201cIn prison, if I\u2018m allowed to write, maybe I\u2018ll do some fiction about this,\u201c he said.Corsi gained notoriety as the author of a book questioning John Kerry\u2018s military service during the 2004 presidential campaign. He also fomented birtherism, a conspiracy theory that Trump ultimately championed as well. Trump once retweeted a Corsi article claiming baselessly that Obama\u2018s administration fabricated jobs numbers. According to an ABC report last month, Corsi was scheduled to appear before the Mueller grand jury on Nov. 2. But reporters at the Washington courthouse that day did not see him enter or leave the building. During a webcast last Monday, Corsi said he\u2019d been involved \u201cin a really constant basis\u201d with the Mueller investigation for about two months.\u201cIt\u2019d been one of the biggest pushes of my life,\u201d he said on the show. Beyond that, Corsi said, he couldn\u2019t talk about the special counsel inquiry.\u201cThere will come a time when I can and will talk about it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut right now I\u2019m going to continue to follow my lawyer\u2019s advice and be in a \u2018no comment\u2018 mode.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
