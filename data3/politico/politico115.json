The police group, which Canterbury has headed for more than a decade, had previously opposed the legislation.Story Continued BelowIt was an unusual move for the law enforcement veteran, who enthusiastically testified at last year\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing on behalf of Jeff Sessions, Trump's recently dismissed attorney general and a high-profile opponent of the criminal justice reform legislation. Canterbury\u2019s group said in a statement ahead of the president\u2019s endorsement that the First Step Act would boost safety \u201cin our streets and neighborhoods\u201d and better protect police.\u201cWe are proud to stand with President Trump on this issue,\u201d he said Wednesday.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Canterbury recently emerged as a contender for ATF, where deputy director Thomas Brandon has served as the acting head since April 2015, according to three sources familiar with the situation. He has for months been lobbying for a \u201cbig job\u201d in the administration, according to a former White House official, who said Canterbury\u2019s name was bandied about for several roles.Canterbury has a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Trump, according to a close friend, and has been a regular presence at White House listening sessions on immigration and issues affecting law enforcement. At a late October board meeting, he told colleagues he was flattered to have had his name floated for ATF chief, but had not formally been offered the job, according to a person in the room. This person said Canterbury is currently running for an eighth term as head of the FOP, describing the competitive re-election process as \u201clike running for Congress nationwide.\u201d\u201cChuck is one of the most honorable people I\u2019ve ever worked with and if he is selected, I can\u2019t think of a finer person to take the position,\u201d Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, told POLITICO.\nMedia \n                    By JASON SCHWARTZBut Thompson\u2019s group, which represents over 3,000 elected sheriffs in the U.S., was among several to forcefully push back on the legislation, claiming in a statement this week that the bill would \u201crelease dangerous criminals back into our communities\u2026 [and] falls far short in the funding, personnel and social services needed to protect our communities.\u201dRepublican senators who have withheld support for the measure, which would require 60 \u201cyes\u201d votes to pass the upper chamber, cited the opposition by Thompson\u2019s organization in defending their own position.\u201cI put great weight on the views of those sheriffs,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). \u201cThey have grave concerns about a \u2018social experiment\u2019 of this kind.\u201dLike other opponents, Cotton said he would prefer that the legislation \u201cfocus on prison reform and give prisoners who are on their way out of prison a chance to land on their feet,\u201d instead of introducing greater leniency in mandatory minimum sentencing for serious offenders.The Fraternal Order\u2019s endorsement puzzled its law enforcement community allies in part because it was a reversal of its earlier position. Canterbury and his team had several meetings and phone calls with White House officials, including the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, between August, when the group reportedly described the proposal as \u201cunworkable,\u201d and Trump\u2019s declaration of support this week. \u201cThere were regular phone conversations with staff and we sent a letter to the president articulating our concerns,\u201d said FOP executive director Jim Pasco.\nCongress\n                    By RACHAEL BADE\u201cPasco said the group struck \u201ccommon ground\u201d after changes were made to the bill, including the removal of conditions that would have eased existing limitations on early release for persons who used firearms in the commission of their crimes.\u201d\u201cWe wanted it to be well-defined that violent felons wouldn\u2019t get reduced sentences,\u201d Canterbury told the Washington Post.Others suggested the FOP was never truly against the legislation and made it easy for the administration to secure their support. \u201cThey were ready to fold pretty quickly,\u201d said the law enforcement official, who claimed the group at one point simply requested a \u201cstudy on the effects\u201d of the legislation in order to throw their weight behind it.Those claiming the group\u2019s endorsement was linked in some fashion to Canterbury angling for a Trump administration post are playing \u201cpart of the game in Washington,\u201d Pasco said.\u201cIt was a confluence of timing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious or untoward,\u201d added the person close to Canterbury.Should the bill pass the Senate, it would return to the House where proponents of the legislation have already begun whipping support in its favor. One potential problem as the plan moves forward is acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has privately warned Trump about aspects of the bill related to illicit drugs. However, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Post that Whitaker \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to kill it\u201d following a meeting with the interim attorney general.Missing out on the latest scoops?
