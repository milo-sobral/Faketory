Maxine Waters and at times sounded as though he was running against Hillary Clinton, saying that if she had won in 2016, \u201cwe would\u2019ve lost the country.\u201dIn short, he\u2019s running as a local version of President Donald Trump \u2014 and banking on the president lifting him to victory in a Democratic-held House district for the first time in his three congressional campaigns.Story Continued BelowMost House Republicans around the country are playing defense this election, as Democrats try to flip 23 districts and take the House majority. But Hagedorn is one of two Minnesota Republicans seeking to flip rural, Democratic-held districts in the other direction \u2014 a key piece of Republicans\u2019 narrow hopes of retaining the House.Winning those districts would mean that Democrats have to beat another couple of incumbent Republicans elsewhere in the country, potentially making the difference on a close election night. And even as many of those Republicans try to stem shrinking GOP support in the suburbs in the Trump era, Hagedorn is hoping that he can build on the president\u2019s supercharged rural appeal in 2016, when Trump carried Minnesota\u2019s 1st District by double-digits while Democratic Rep. Tim Walz narrowly won reelection.\u201cThis is a miniature national election,\u201d Hagedorn said in an interview with POLITICO before the debate. \u201cWe\u2019ve approached it this way the entire time \u2026 we\u2019re running on national issues.\u201dYour guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Down the road in La Crescent two hours later, Feehan launched volunteer canvassers from a local sports pub with a pep talk on health care.Missing from much of those conversations? Trump.Feehan, in an interview, said that he would work with the president \u201cwhen it benefits southern Minnesota,\u201d citing infrastructure as one example. But he insisted that the voters \u201caren\u2019t hyper-partisan here,\u201d and while \u201cthere are things [voters] like about the president, being a check on him would bring stability.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the contrast: A check and balance for the president, or a rubber stamp,\u201d Feehan added. Feehan\u2019s tightrope walk over Trump is emblematic of how Democrats in other rural, blue-collar districts throughout the country are dealing with the president: \u201cThey\u2019re not talking about Trump, and they probably shouldn\u2019t talk about Trump,\u201d said Ian Russell, the former political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about health care because that\u2019s what\u2019s hurting Republicans.\u201d\u201cTrump, well, isn\u2019t hurting Republicans\u2019 chances in places like that,\u201d Russell added.Struggling to connect with rural America isn\u2019t a new problem for Democrats. It started a decade ago when \u201cway too many\u201d Democrats \u201cwrote off small towns and lesser populated counties as Republican territory,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos, who represents a swathe of rural Illinois. Back in 2009, Democrats held 57 percent of Midwestern districts, including many rural ones. But by 2017, they hold just over one-third of them, according to Bustos\u2019 \u201cHope from the Heartland\u201d report.That feeling is echoed by Sadredin Moosavi, a 49-year-old voter waiting outside the Hagedorn-Feehan debate who said that \u201cworking class voters have been ignored by Democrats for eight years, so it\u2019s been building up,\u201d Moosavi, who once supported Walz, said that voters like him are \u201ctired of being demeaned, so we\u2019re going to vote for Republicans.\u201d \u201cOur party is concentrated in cities and urban areas, which is a long-term structural problem for us in the Electoral College and the House,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.The Democratic Party \u2014 dominated by leadership who hail from New York City and San Francisco \u2014 can easily \u201cbe fed to these rural voters\u201d as \u201cDemocrats just want to abolish ICE and impeach Trump,\u201d said a Democratic consultant, granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cThere\u2019s a heavier burden on Democrats in these districts to cross a threshold with these voters because of the way non-rural Democrats have come to define what the party is in those areas.\u201d\nElections \n                    By DAVID SIDERSBut national Democrats haven\u2019t written off the Feehan and Hagedorn match-up yet. The DCCC is spending nearly $2 million on TV ads attacking Hagedorn, while small-dollar donors from across the country poured more than $2 million into Feehan\u2019s campaign coffers last quarter.Local Democrats \u2013 who emphasized Feehan\u2019s military resume as similar to Walz\u2019s \u2013 hope that the district will course-correct, suggesting that Trump was \u201cmaybe an anomaly, a fluke,\u201d said Debra Hoegenson, the vice chairwoman of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in the 1st District. \u201cIt was as much an anti-Hillary vote as it was a pro-Trump vote, so maybe it\u2019ll revert back this year.\u201dBut things look grimmer up north for Democrats. In Minnesota\u2019s 8th District, Republicans appear poised to flip a congressional seat that has Democrats had held almost uninterrupted for generations, before Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan announced his retirement earlier this year. This week, the DCCC pulled its TV ad reservations in the district, leaving Democrat Joe Radinovich, who managed Nolan\u2019s previous congressional races, to fend for himself. Radinovich, for his part, raised more than $1 million last quarter.Republican Pete Stauber also said that he talks frequently about Trump on the trail because \u201che has the backs of men and women here,\u201d so he\u2019s \u201cvery popular here,\u201d he said.But Bustos insisted that the slate of candidates in these rural seats \u201cfit their districts like a glove,\u201d and the Democratic Party is poised to make inroads back into these communities.\u201cWe\u2019re on the frontlines,\u201d Feehan said in an interview, acknowledging that he\u2019s one of the few Democrats defending rural territory. \u201cWhat is being defined here, I think, will help define the Democratic Party and the country. What happens here will have a ripple effect.\u201d Missing out on the latest scoops?
