Ron DeSantis in his gubernatorial run against Democrat Andrew Gillum, who currently serves as mayor of Tallahassee, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott in the tight Senate race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.Story Continued Below\u201cIn Rick\u2019s case, he\u2019s going against somebody that\u2019s falling asleep,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd in Ron\u2019s case, he\u2019s going against somebody who\u2019s got a lot of energy, but he runs one of the worst \u2014 one of the biggest problem cities anywhere in the country. He\u2019s not doing his job. You don\u2019t want to have him running Florida, that I can tell you.\u201dFrom there, Trump talked about how Democrats across the country should expect a tough fight, because of the recent success of Republicans, including himself.\u201cIn the history of our country, today, more Americans are working than ever before in the history of our country. That\u2019s a good sound bite,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just saying, that\u2019s awfully tough to beat somebody when I\u2019m debating one of the far-left candidates that the Democrats will produce \u2014 when you have two of them running against our two friends,\u201d he added. \u201cBut can you imagine in the debate? We have the most successful economy ever. What are they going to say? We have the best job numbers ever. What are they going to say? It\u2019s going to be hopefully very easy debates.\u201dYour guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It won\u2019t be one. It\u2019ll be three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the person plus the media, against me. So that makes it a little tougher. That makes it a little bit tougher.\u201d \u201cRemember the way they treated Hillary [Clinton],\u201d he posited, referencing the 2016 presidential debates. \u201c\u2018Oh Madame Secretary. Oh, what did you have for breakfast, Madame Secretary? Did you enjoy it? And as far as you, Mr. Trump, bah bah bah.\u2019 No, we have three people on that stage.\u201dHe also hit at the media \u2014 a common theme of his rally run, so far.\u201cCould the cameras please pan out and show this crowd? It would be really nice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWould you do that? You know, they never like to do that, folks. They never like to do that. Could you pan out? See, they won\u2019t turn that camera. They don\u2019t want to turn the camera. They never do, unless there\u2019s a little problem \u2014 in which case that camera bends in 15 different directions, right? That camera can bend and turn. They never show the crowd, but people hear the crowd.\u201dAnd returning to the original reason behind the eight-state, 11-rally effort, Trump called out several Democrats currently in office.\u201cBut if Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer \u2014 you know Cryin\u2019 Chuck \u2014 Nancy Pelosi or the legendary genius Maxine Waters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they take power, then they will try to wipe away all that we\u2019ve done and at the same time double and triple and quadruple your taxes. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
