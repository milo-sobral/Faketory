Leadership matters,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at a Lakeland rally, according to audio provided by American Bridge. \u201cAnd that is why this election is so cotton-pickin' important to the state of Florida. I hope you all don\u2019t mess it up.\u201dStory Continued BelowPerdue is a former governor of Georgia.\u201cYou would have to ask Governor Perdue about any of his remarks,\u201d Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for DeSantis\u2019 campaign, said by email. \u201cWe were happy to have him in Polk County campaigning with us.\u201cThe phrase \u201ccotton-pickin\u2018\u201d bedeviled another Trump Republican earlier this year when the president\u2019s former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, apologized in June for telling a black guest on Fox News, \u201cYou\u2019re out of your cotton-pickin' mind.\u201dBefore Bossie could apologize, program host Ed Henry called the phrase \u201cdeeply offensive and wholly inappropriate.\u201dFrom the start of the general election, race has played a dominating factor in Florida\u2019s nationally-watched governor\u2018s race. The day after the Aug. 28 primary election, on a different Fox show, DeSantis called Gillum \u201carticulate\u201d and said voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing him. Like Bossie, DeSantis was rebuked on air by a Fox News personality, but the former three-term congressman, who is white, refused to apologize because he said he did nothing wrong and his comment was not about race.During an Oct. 21 debate, Gillum directly addressed the \u201cmonkey this up\u201d remark in a racial context after the moderator asked DeSantis about the comments.\u201cHe has only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ve been black all of my life. So far as I know, I will die black.\u201dDeSantis has fiercely pushed back against any accusations he is racist, offering up his time as a Navy JAG officer as evidence.\u201cWhen I was down-range in Iraq, we worked as a team regardless of race,\u201d DeSantis said during the second and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 24.The moderator at that debate asked DeSantis about the fact he has spoken at conferences organized by conservative David Horowitz, who has in the past sparked controversy for statements like \u201cthe country\u2019s only serious race war is against whites.\u201d\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness, I\u2019m not going to let the media smear me.\u201dGillum\u2019s response drew loud reaction from the audience, and later went viral.\u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI\u2019m saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201dMarc Caputo contributed to this report.A weekly, must-read brief on health care news and moves in Tallahassee and around the stateA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on Florida politics and policy.A weekly must-read on budget politics for Florida Pros, with exclusive reporting and analysis, interviews and more.
