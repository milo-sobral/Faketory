Glenn Grothman had been getting pummeled by his Democratic opponent for voting to curb protections for people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 most recently with an attack ad depicting a little boy with an oxygen mask over his face gasping for air.So on a conference call with GOP leaders last week, Grothman pleaded with party leaders to invest in a nationwide TV ad that could run in competitive districts like his, defending the House GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill that passed the chamber last year, according to three sources on the call.Story Continued BelowYou\u2019re on your own, was the response. It would be too expensive, Republican leaders told Grothman.House Republicans are increasingly worried that Democrats\u2019 attacks on their votes to repeal and replace Obamacare could cost them the House. While the legislation stalled in the Senate, it\u2019s become a toxic issue on the campaign trail for the House Republicans who backed it.Toxic and ubiquitous: Democrats have maintained an almost single-minded focus on health care in their campaign messaging. More than 54 percent of pro-Democratic campaign ads in federal races mentioned the issue between mid-September and mid-October, according to a recent study by Wesleyan University\u2019s Media Project.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

That's 43 percent of the total $209.1 million they\u2019ve spent on TV ads.Republicans have tried to fend off the attacks by accusing Democrats of lying \u2014 and by trying to claim that they\u2019re the ones who want to protect insurance safeguards for the infirm. In a Tuesday morning tweet, President Donald Trump wrote that \u201cRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.\u201dBut those claims ring hollow given what Republicans voted for last year. The House bill allowed states to opt out of provisions protecting the elderly and the sick from higher premiums in hopes of lowering costs for everyone else.  On top of that, the Trump administration has been trying to repeal Obamacare \u2014 including its popular safeguards for the sick \u2014 through a lawsuit supported by 20 GOP state attorneys general, including two of four Republicans running in competitive Senate races who have endorsed the court challenge.That\u2019s given Democrats ample fodder to dog vulnerable Republicans on an issue that\u2019s increasingly driving voters to the polls. \u201cI\u2019m getting my ass kicked\u201d for backing the House repeal plan, Republican Rep. Martha McSally, who\u2019s running for an open Senate seat in Arizona, acknowledged to Sean Hannity this week. Though she insisted that the repeal bill is \u201cbeing misconstrued by the Democrats,\u201d it\u2019s clear she thinks the ads are taking a toll.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to invoke fear in people who have family members and loved ones with pre-existing conditions,\u201d she told Hannity. McSally is airing her own ad in response claiming that she\u2019s \u201cleading the fight to ... force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.\u201dGrothman represents what\u2019s been a GOP stronghold in Wisconsin, but the health care attacks have contributed to a tightening of the race, Democrats say. Grothman has been forced to spend money parrying the attacks, and he argued during a debate against his challenger, Democrat Dan Kohl, last night that he never voted to gut protections for people with pre-existing health problems.\nElections\n                    By RACHAEL BADE and ELENA SCHNEIDER\u201cI\u2019m Glenn Grothman, and I won\u2019t take a dime from pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Grothman said in a new ad released this week. The video aired just a few days after Kohl\u2019s ad depicting the sick child and asserting that \u201cinsurance companies love Glenn Grothman,\u201d because he \u201cdoes what they want, so they give thousands to his campaigns.\u201d\u201cHealth care is the No. 1 issue I hear about on the trail,\u201d Kohl said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cPeople here are rightfully concerned about their health care being taken away.\u201dSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said in a recent interview that his party\u2019s \u201cturnout data tells us health care is the No. 1 issue that\u2019s going to move low-frequency Democratic voters to the polls in a few weeks.\u201dWhile the debate over health care used to favor Republicans, a Washington Post/ABC News poll released last week found that voters trust Democrats on the issue more than Republicans by a 53 percent to 35 percent margin.The idea of scuttling protections for pre-existing conditions is unpopular across the political spectrum. More than seven in 10 voters, including two-thirds of Republicans, said it should be illegal for insurers to be allowed to charge more for coverage of individuals with earlier health problems, according to a Morning Consult poll released last month.Senate Democratic candidates have intensified their focus on health care in the campaign in recent days, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he could take another crack at repealing Obamacare next year, depending \u201con the outcome of the election.\u201d Murphy described that interest in revisiting Obamacare repeal as \u201ca gift\u201d to Democrats, and Senate Republican candidates are tiptoeing around the issue.Indiana GOP nominee Mike Braun, who\u2019s running neck-and-neck with Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, walked that rhetorical tightrope on Wednesday. He told reporters on a conference call that he \u201cwon\u2019t be for [Obamacare] repeal unless we\u2019ve got a great replacement\u201d that addresses pre-existing conditions as well as caps on coverage that Obamacare eliminated.\u201cWhen we do repeal\u201d Obamacare, Braun said, \u201cwe need to have something ready to go or else we will lose the trust of the public that we\u2019ve got something that\u2019s going to replace it.\u201dMcConnell, for one, has praised Senate GOP candidates for being \u201cable to deal with\u201d the onslaught of Democratic ads slamming his party on Obamacare repeal.\nElections\n                    By ELENA SCHNEIDER\u201cThere\u2019s nobody in the Senate that I\u2019m familiar with who\u2019s not in favor of covering pre-existing conditions,\u201d the Senate GOP leader told Bloomberg last week.Dodging the topic is tougher for House Republicans because many of them voted for repeal. The text would have allowed states to define their own \u201cessential health benefits\u201d rather than using Obamacare\u2019s definition of health care services that all insurance companies had to cover. And states could decide to opt out of requirements that insurance companies charge healthy and sick people the same.Additionally, the bill would have given insurance companies more leeway to charge seniors higher premiums; Democrats and AARP have called that proposal an \u201cage tax.\u201d A recent Democratic attack ad in GOP Rep. Brian Mast\u2019s coastal Florida district, a hotspot for retirees, highlighted the vulnerable lawmaker\u2019s vote for the House GOP replacement plan.\u201cHere at home, Brian Mast\u2019s votes could increase premiums almost $3,000 per family,\u201d the narrator says in the ad. \u201cFlorida can\u2019t afford to pay more for health care. And we can\u2019t afford Brian Mast.\u201dHouse Republican are trying to argue that their failed bill would have protected people with pre-existing conditions because it also created a stopgap, or \u201crisk pool,\u201d to cover anyone priced out of the market. But the bill had a finite amount of funding for that: $138 billion, which some health care analysts said was way too little to work.Democrats like Kohl are calling the GOP claim that they\u2019re protecting sicker individuals a \u201cflat-out lie.\u201d And Democrats around the nation predict that Republican attempts to wiggle away from the effect of their Obamacare repeal legislation won\u2019t pass muster with the electorate.\u201cOnce the Titanic hits the iceberg,\u201d said veteran Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, who works with multiple health care groups, \u201cyou can\u2019t fix the problem by changing your navigation system.\u201dJames Arkin and Adam Cancryn contributed.Missing out on the latest scoops?
