Claire McCaskill repeatedly for using a private plane to travel around Missouri. But the Republican Senate hopeful isn\u2019t above taking a ride in a private plane himself.Hawley received an in-kind contribution of $5,225 for a charter flight in September on a plane owned by lobbyist Travis Brown and his wife, according to public records. Hawley attended a West Virginia fundraiser on that day, social media posts show, before returning to Springfield, Mo., that night \u2014 and posting a Facebook video of him driving into the city for a rally with President Donald Trump the next day.Story Continued BelowBrown is a registered lobbyist in Missouri whose clients include the St. Louis Blues hockey team and wealthy businessman Rex Sinquefield, a Hawley donor who\u2019s linked to a state-level effort to permit medical marijuana use. The plane in which Hawley flew, a Pilatus PC-12/47, is registered to Brown\u2019s business address, and flight records show it leaving Missouri for West Virginia on Sept. 20 and returning later that night. In campaign finance disclosures, Hawley also reported charter plane expenses of $8,732 for a flight in August and three flights in September. It is unclear who owned those planes or where Hawley went; his campaign declined to provide details about the flights.Hawley has slammed McCaskill for using her own private plane during the campaign. In particular, he blasted the senator after she flew between stops on two days she had billed as an RV tour of the state, calling her \"out of touch.\"Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

There's no hypocritical level to which Hawley won't stoop,\" she said.The private plane used by McCaskill and owned by her husband, Joseph Shepard, is the same model that Hawley used in September, a Pilatus PC-12/47, according to reports dating back to Shepard's purchase of the aircraft in 2013. In 2011, facing a controversy that threatened her reelection, McCaskill reimbursed the Treasury Department for more than $88,000 in charter air flights in 2011 and repaid nearly $300,000 in back taxes on an older plane she later sold. Afterward, McCaskill vowed to pay personally for any travel she took on the new plane bought by Shepard\u2019s company. \n\n                    By ELANA SCHOREven as he took aim at her use of the private plane, Hawley has said he would be fine with the trips if McCaskill would just \u201cown it.\u201d He also has challenged her to stop using the plane for a month as the two duke it out in one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the midterm elections. \u201cI say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m driving everywhere, why don\u2019t you drive?\u2019\u201d Hawley said in a July interview. \u201cShe can\u2019t do it. She\u2019s totally addicted to her luxury lifestyle. This is the thing, she talks about, \u2018Oh, I want to spend all this time on the trail.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t spend that much time on the trail. She flies everywhere.\u201dRepublicans have dubbed McCaskill \u201cAir Claire,\u201d shadowing her at events and waving air traffic control wands. But McCaskill has continued to use her family\u2019s plane during the campaign. The two-term incumbent says most people running for statewide office in Missouri charter planes, as do most senators.\u201cIt\u2019s a way I can contribute to my campaign personally in a way that\u2019s meaningful. It doesn\u2019t take away from our budget for our other things. And it allows us to get more places,\u201d McCaskill said in an interview this July. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of very many candidates for the U.S. Senate or governors in this state that haven\u2019t used a chartered plane.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
