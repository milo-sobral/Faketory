He plans to register as a lobbyist, according to the firm. Kai Anderson, the firm\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that Johnson would bolster the firm\u2019s \u201cnational security and federal funding capabilities.\u201d Cassidy lobbies on defense issues for dozens of clients, according to disclosure reports, including BAE Systems, Intel, Palantir, the University of Nebraska and Verizon.Story Continued BelowIN MEMORIAM: MICHAEL ADCOCK: Michael Adcock, a vice president and longtime lobbyist at Van Scoyoc Associates, died on Saturday after a long battle with cancer, according to the firm. He was 64. Stu Van Scoyoc, the firm\u2019s founder, said in an interview that he\u2019d first met Adcock on the Hill in the 1980s while Adcock was working for former Rep. Ronnie Flippo (D-Ala.), who represented Adcock\u2019s home state. Adcock later worked for former Rep. Bud Cramer, another Alabama Democrat, before joining Van Scoyoc Associates. \u201cHe was one of the first people as we were growing the firm that I wanted to reach out to,\u201d Van Scoyoc said. Adcock specialized in appropriations and health care work, lobbying for clients including his alma mater, the University of Alabama system.\u2014 Adcock was funny and personable, Van Scoyoc said, which were assets in his lobbying work. But he also loved going deep into the weeds researching the issues that mattered to his clients. \u201cHe was very nerdy, but most people never saw that side of him,\u201d Van Scoyoc said. He\u2019s survived by his wife, Cynthia Dodd Adcock; his daughters, Alexandra and Avery; and a son-in-law, Chris Ramanauskas. Donations can be made to a University of Alabama scholarship fund created in his name (which can be found here by typing \u201cAdcock\u201d into the search field.) The firm will match up to $12,500 in donations by its employees.Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call. Send me your tips: tmeyer@politico.com.

Steve King (R-Iowa) through its PAC anymore. The company made the announcement after Judd Legum, the author of the Popular Information newsletter and former editor-in-chief of ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday morning that he couldn\u2019t \u201cget @LandOLakesInc to explain why it gave 2.5K to Steve King despite his history of racist comments and, recently, endorsing a white supremicist [sic] for mayor.\u201d The tweet had been retweeted nearly 11,000 times as of Tuesday afternoon. (Legum also highlighted other companies that have supported King through their PACs, including AT&T, Berkshire Hathaway, Purina and Tyson Foods, as well as the American Bankers Association.)\u2014 \u201cThe Land O\u2019Lakes, Inc. PAC has traditionally contributed to lawmakers of both parties that represent the communities where our members and employees live and work and are also on committees that oversee policies that directly impact our farmer owners,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe take our civic responsibility seriously, want our contributions to be a positive force for good and also seek to ensure that recipients of our contributions uphold our company\u2019s values. On that basis, we have determined that our PAC will no longer support Rep. Steve King moving forward.\u201d\u2014 King\u2019s association with far-right elements has drawn condemnations recently even from fellow Republicans. \u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate,\u201d Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201dElection day is almost here.

Hohlt, a longtime lobbyist who has served on the President\u2019s Commission on White House Fellowships since Trump appointed him to the post in June 2017, said in emails with the Center for Public Integrity that his upcoming 71st birthday has caused him to reconsider who he represents,\u201d the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s Sarah Kleiner and Lateshia Beachum report. \u201c\u2019I am currently in the process of reevaluating my representation, my participation, and retirement,\u2019 Hohlt said in an email.
