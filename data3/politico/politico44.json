The GOP candidate \u2014 a former pharmaceutical executive trying to unseat Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) \u2014 tweeted Tuesday morning that Trump \u201cis wrong\u201d on the issue and that the United States is a \u201cnation of immigrants made better by the diversity of its people.\u201dStory Continued BelowHe doubled down in the afternoon, telling reporters at a campaign stop that he didn\u2019t \u201cbelieve anybody is well served by inflammatory comments, whether they be racist, anti-Semitic, offensive in any ways.\u201d \u201cPart of the problem is our country is too partisan,\u201d Hugin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get people \u2014 elect people \u2014 who are going to work together to solve the people\u2019s problems.\u201dPressed on whether he applied those criticisms to Trump, Hugin said he did.\u201cI think there has been much of the president\u2019s rhetoric that has been inflammatory,\u201d Hugin said, though he didn\u2019t know if that was Trump\u2019s goal. \u201cHe\u2019d have to speak for himself. I don\u2019t know what his intentions are. But my observation is I find some of the rhetoric inflammatory.\u201dThe remarks by a leading Republican Senate candidate, said to be just a few paces behind a 12-year Democratic incumbent, show how the president\u2019s near-daily overtures to immigration hardliners could complicate his party\u2019s efforts in more moderate states and congressional districts.In recent days, Trump has announced plans to send 5,200 active duty troops to the Mexican border and continued to make remarks about a caravan of migrants still some 1,000 miles from the U.S., saying the group includes \u201csome very bad people\u201d and warning they were planning \u201can invasion of our country.\u201dOn Tuesday, a week before the election, Axios published an interview in which Trump he said plans to sign an executive order that would end the practice of granting automatic U.S. citizenship to those born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The move is likely to face a legal challenge, with many saying the practice is protected by the U.S. Constitution.Menendez, the son of Cuban refugees, jumped on the immigration issue Tuesday, saying Trump was trying to stir up anger with his remarks and \u201cmilitarization at the border.\u201d\u201cThis is all about the politics of fear,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cIt is about the politics of trying to drive his electoral base about one week before the election. But it\u2019s not about bringing this country together at the end of the day.\u201dThe president\u2019s repeated and sustained remarks on immigration have the potential to alienate many voters in New Jersey, where there are some 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, and where the GOP hasn\u2019t won a U.S. Senate election since 1972.The messaging comes as Hugin, a deep-pocketed, moderate Republican, claims to be within striking distance of Menendez, as most polls show the incumbent up by single digits and as national Democrats are putting big money into a New Jersey Senate race for the first time in years.Such a state of affairs would have seemed unlikely in any other election year. But Menendez remains bruised by a federal corruption trial in which he was accused of carrying out official favors for a Florida eye doctor \u2014 now a convicted Medicaid fraudster \u2014 in exchange for campaign cash, private jet flights and lavish Dominican vacations.Menendez avoided conviction when a mistrial was declared and a judge dismissed the charges against him. But the Senate Select Committee on Ethics severely admonished him, demanding he pay back the value of the gifts.Hugin, a former CEO and executive chairman of the New Jersey pharmaceutical firm Celgene, has pumped $27.5 million of his own money into the race and used much of the cash on TV ads highlighting the allegations against Menendez. More recently, Hugin has run ads that raise old, unsubstantiated allegations that Menendez had sex with underage prostitutes \u2014 pinning it to an FBI agent's affidavit even though many thought the claims to be discredited.But it\u2019s Hugin's links to Trump that could save Menendez in the end, polling has showed. Hugin donated six-figures to Trump's campaign, and served on his New Jersey finance committee and as a delegate for Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention.Hugin has worked on the trail to distance himself from the president. He\u2019s repeatedly referred to himself an \u201cindependent Republican\u201d and said he won\u2019t be beholden to anyone put New Jersey voters. He had already called for immigration reform prior to his remarks on Tuesday.He sought to highlight that position again, this time under pressure to do so. \u201cImmigration\u2019s been great for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandparents are immigrants. We\u2019re a stronger country culturally and economically. But we need to reform it.\u201d He said he wants to change visa rules to \u201cbasically staple green cards to people who are getting degrees in computer science and biochemistry.\u201d And, he said, it\u2019s vital that tourism and agricultural businesses in New Jersey are able to hire seasonal workers.\u201cThe fact that we didn\u2019t secure the borders is out fault,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to secure the borders, have safe, secure cities. But the people the people that are here building productive, constructive lives should have a pathway to citizenship \u2014 not one that is shorter than people that are here legally.\u201d Matt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the dayOur morning email about New Jersey health care policy and politicsA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.POLITICO New Jersey Pro's high-level outlook on the policy issues driving the month in New Jersey.Matt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the day\n                        POLITICO ProA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.\n                        POLITICO ProOur morning email about New Jersey health care policy and politics\n                        POLITICO PROPOLITICO New Jersey Pro\u2019s high-level outlook on the policy issues driving the month in New Jersey.\n                        POLITICO ProOriginal federal and state policy documents \u00a9 2018 POLITICO LLC"}
