Story Continued BelowThe latest blow came Thursday, when Democrat Katie Porter, an UC Irvine professor, defeated Republican Rep. Mimi Walters in a district which represents the beating political heart of Orange County.\u201cI believe that the party has to die before it can be rebuilt. And by die \u2014 I mean, completely decimated. And I think Tuesday night was a big step,\u2019\u2019 says veteran California GOP political consultant Mike Madrid. \u201cThere is no message. There is no messenger. There is no money. And there is no infrastructure.\u201dOur must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The Grand Old Party is dead,\u201d wrote former state GOP Assembly leader Kristin Olsen, who startled fellow Republicans with a brutally frank op-ed this week saying Republicans must acknowledge their \u201cserious problem\u201d in California, particularly the effects of toxicity of President Trump. GOP strategist John Weaver, who has worked California races and also has represented the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, seconded Olsen\u2019s view, tweeting that the effects of the Trump presidency have doomed any chance of resurrection. \u201cIn one fell swoop Trump & Republicans who willingly handcuffed themselves to him have turned Orange County into a GOP wasteland,\u2019\u2019 he tweeted this week. \u201cYou want to see the future? Look no further than the demographic death spiral in the place once considered a cornerstone of the party.\u201dMadrid argues that many California Republican leaders remain in complete denial of the fact that their continued support of Trump presidency has sealed the fate of the GOP \u2014 and last week\u2019s midterm elections revealed the true extent of the GOP\u2019s rot in California, where the state party has now shrunken to third party status.\u201cNow, it\u2019s just open warfare. The barbarians have broken through the gates. The army is in full retreat,\u2019\u2019 said Madrid, who adds there\u2019s no hope left for a party that for years has been on a path toward destruction. \u201cBurn it to the ground. I want to reconstitute.\u2019\u2019\nCongress\n                    By RACHAEL BADERepublicans looking at the ashes of the midterm results say they must envision what a new party will look like \u2014 after the current structure and its leadership has been entirely disassembled.\u201cThat\u2019s the question: how do you start over?,\u2019\u2019 said Joel Fox, a longtime GOP strategist who publishes the \u201cFox & Hounds Daily\u201d commentary site. He says the answer will be more wide-ranging than finding \u201cone dynamic leader\u201d \u2014 celebrity or billionaire \u2014 to rescue their cause.\u201cThe rise of the Republican Party may really depend on the Democratic Party,\u2019\u2019 Fox said, and how it handles the heady times of having a $14 billion surplus and a supermajority under the leadership of the incoming Governor-elect Gavin Newsom. If progressives try to push their agenda too far, and land too many pro-tax ballot measures in front of the voters in future ballots \u2014 including revisions of the landmark property tax measure Prop. 13, soda taxes and oil taxes \u2014 it\u2019s possible they will create an opening for the GOP to return to viability.Not everyone agrees that Trump is the cause for the party\u2019s bottoming out. This week, former state GOP chair Shawn Steel, a member of the Republican National Committee, argued in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner that \u201cit\u2019s not Trump\u201d who lost Orange County dominance for the party. He laid the blame on millions of dollars in \u201cdark money\u201d raised by Democrats, who he said were aided by better organization and help from the tech industry in Silicon Valley. And \u2014 without any substantiation \u2014 Steel also claimed Democratic voter registration drives produced \u201cborderline fraudulent turnout rates\u201d in some key districts.Already, a leading pro-Trump Republican voice \u2014 former gubernatorial candidate Assemblyman Travis Allen, a far-right conservative who fully supports the president\u2019s wall and immigration policies \u2014 has kicked off his campaign to head the state GOP, announcing that it\u2019s time to \u201ctake back California.\u201dBut a growing number of Republicans in the party\u2019s #NeverTrump wing \u2014 which includes prominent strategists like Rob Stutzman and Luis Alvarado \u2014 insist that a new beginning will rely heavily on a full-throated repudiation of Trump\u2019s caustic divisiveness. They believe the rebuilding process could require years, if not generations, to rid the state GOP of the taint of a president who is blamed for ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment in a state that is home to more immigrants than any other in the country.This isn\u2019t the first time the dilapidated Republican Party in California has faced a dire outlook \u2014 or debated the notion that it must be completely overhauled. In 2007, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was lambasted by Republicans when he delivered an address to their state convention warning that the GOP was \u201cdying at the box office\u2019\u2019 because they lacked inclusive messaging and policies, particularly to minorities who now dominate the state\u2019s demographics.And in assuming the leadership of the party in 2013, former state Sen. Jim Brulte predicted it would take at least six years to rebuild the structure and fundraising strength of Republican in California. He warned then that Republicans would need to \u201ceither stop the bleeding and/or start turning it around\u201d in 2014 --- or the party will be in the pits \u201cfor the rest of the decade.\u201d \nLetter From San Francisco\n                    By CARLA MARINUCCINone of that altered the party\u2019s downward trajectory, however, or caused a wholesale rethinking among some leading candidates and party leaders. Madrid cites the recent gubernatorial contest in which Republican nominee John Cox, who described himself repeatedly as a \u201cJack Kemp\u201d Republican, pushed for Trump policies that are abhorrent to many Californians. \u201cIt is completely unfathomable...for a Republican nominee to run on building a wall,\u2019\u2019 said Madrid, a nationally recognized expert on Latino voting trends who noted that the party has spent 20 years trying to extricate itself from the damage done by Prop. 187, the anti-illegal immigration ballot measure that eviscerated Latino support in the state. \u201cAnd everyone acts like it\u2019s normal...Cox was running on that, in California. Are you out of your mind?\u201dMadrid, who most recently advised the gubernatorial campaign of former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, said the party needs to stop looking for silver bullets \u2014 like a gas tax repeal \u2014 and confront the disintegration of some of the state GOP\u2019s once most reliable electorates, especially college-educated voters and women.\u201cWe hemorrhaged college-educated Republican voters on Tuesday night. The \u2018diploma divide\u2019 is a very real thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller it gets, the more monolithic is gets. The whiter it gets. The more populist-nationalist it gets. What you\u2019re seeing in the Republican Party is that it\u2019s the party of white identity politics.\u201dDemocratic political strategist Darry Sragow says if the party continues on its current path, its complete disintegration is entirely predictable.\u201cThey\u2019re down to 24 percent registration. And the reason is that they have a huge deficit with Latinos, with African Americans...and with Asian Americans. And they now have a deficit with whites,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a party where 77 percent of Republican likely voters in California are white. And the population that\u2019s white here is 39 percent.\u201dHis advice: \u201cThey have to take down the \u2018whites only\u2019 sign from the clubhouse door,\u2019\u2019 Sragow says. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re willing to allow people who aren\u2019t white into the club, they may be able to recover.\u2019\u2019\u201cI think that the GOP is capable of turning itself around, because it\u2019s a well-established brand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe problem is, the people who manage the party are going to have to be willing to do that. And by definition, they are the opposite of that. They have no interest in that.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
