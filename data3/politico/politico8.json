Dean Heller accused Rep. Jacky Rosen of shirking her duties in Nevada to fundraise in California. Rosen accused Heller of lying when he promised to back protections for pre-existing conditions. Heller, a first-term Republican senator, pitched himself as a man of results, touting his relationship with President Donald Trump and his ability to work with the president, from the Republican tax cuts to veterans bills. Rosen, a first-term congresswoman, cast herself as bipartisan and not a \u201ccareer politician\u201d while labeling Heller a \u201crubber stamp\u201d and repeatedly attacking her opponent for being unwilling to stand up to the president. Story Continued BelowHeller, the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state won by Hillary Clinton, has held a slight lead in recent public polls in this battleground Senate race. The lone debate came on the eve of early voting in the state, and Trump, former Vice President Biden and former President Barack Obama will all hold rallies in the coming days to boost the candidates. The initial confrontation in the debate came on health care, which Rosen has made her most significant issue in the race. Rosen attacked Heller for supporting Republicans' Obamacare repeal, saying he \u201cpromised to protect hundreds of thousands of Nevadans and their health care and he went back to Washington and broke that promise.\u201d Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Rosen attacked Heller for a comment he made calling the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh a \u201chiccup\u201d in his confirmation. She also criticized him for backing Kavanaugh with \u201cno reservations\u201d after having refused to meet with Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee in 2016. Heller said the hiccup comment was out of context, and defended his vote to support Kavanaugh, saying he carefully reviewed the FBI investigation into the allegations against him.\u201cYou can be for MeToo, you can be for the MeToo movement and you can be for the rule of law at the same time,\u201d Heller said.Heller also attacked Rosen for voting against Republicans\u2019 tax cuts, which he took credit for writing. He said she would \u201ctake us back to the Obama era of 2 percent growth.\"Rosen, meanwhile, attacked Heller for the corporate tax cuts in the legislation being permanent while the middle-class portion expires after a decade, and for the increase to the national debt. Both repeatedly attempted to tout their bipartisan credentials, with Heller referring to himself multiple times as the \u201cfifth most bipartisan senator\u201d in the chamber, and Rosen touting her work for the \u201cproblem solver\u2019s caucus.\u201d While Rosen knocked Heller's relationship with Trump, the Republican criticized Rosen for having a 90 percent voting record with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Both also took specific shots at their opponents. Heller accused Rosen of shirking her duties in Congress to take a \u201cphoto-op\u201d at the southern border following the administration\u2019s policy of separating families. Rosen said Heller had \u201crubber stamped\u201d every one of Trump's nominations without a second thought. \nWhite House\n                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO and BRENT D. GRIFFITHSHeller, however, defended his relationship with the president. Asked about his previous remark that he was 99 percent against Trump during the 2016 campaign, Heller said the two had formed a working relationship that had blossomed into a friendship.\u201cWe have developed this friendship based on trust,\u201d Heller said. \u201cYeah, we've had our differences and we'll continue to have our differences. I'll be the first to tell you I don't agree with everything he says but I agree with most of what he does.\"Given the opportunity to ask each other a single question, both turned back to attacks that have become central to their campaign, and that they each repeated over and again Friday night. Heller accused Rosen of missing multiple congressional events in Nevada to raise money in California, and asked, \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d Rosen challenged Heller to look into the eyes of a Nevada family and tell them why he had lied over his support for protections of pre-existing conditions.Missing out on the latest scoops?
