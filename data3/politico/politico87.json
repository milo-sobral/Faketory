Jeb Bush on Monday called for embattled Broward County election chief Brenda Snipes to be removed from office, adding fuel to a Republican effort to cast doubt on the validity of statewide election results.The Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office, to which Bush appointed Snipes in 2003, has come under fire since Tuesday\u2019s election. The office continued on Monday to count tens of thousands of ballots, leading some Republicans \u2014 cheered on by President Donald Trump \u2014 to accuse the office of fraud without offering any evidence of wrongdoing.Story Continued Below\u201cThere is no question that Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process,\u201d Bush tweeted to his 1.4 million followers. \u201cSupervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u201dAt several points in recent days, Snipes\u2019 office could not say how many ballots were left to count. The office has already lost a public records fight with the Senate campaign of Republican Gov. Rick Scott. And she\u2019s losing the support of fellow Democrats, too.Snipes has been one of the most scrutinized election officials in the country since she was first appointed by Bush. In May, a federal judge said she violated state and federal laws by destroying ballots from the 2016 reelection bid of Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.She has become the scapegoat upon which many Republicans are blaming the Florida GOP\u2019s midterm election woes. Some state officials say her lax oversight has created an office where election fraud can happen. On Twitter, Trump has pointed to Scott\u2019s shrinking lead over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as evidence of fraud in Broward County, though state law allowed local election offices to count ballots until noon Saturday. Last week, Trump tweeted about \u201cThe Broward Effect,\u201d and wondered why none of the \u201cfound\u201d votes were for Republicans. The president tweeted Monday, Veteran\u2019s Day, that the counting should stop and the results from election night should stand \u2014 an outcome that, some noted, could lead to the disfranchisement of military members stationed overseas.\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected.
