Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is considering running for president in 2020, a source with direct knowledge of her deliberations told POLITICO.Rania Batrice, an adviser to the progressive congresswoman and deputy campaign manager on Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, has been putting out feelers for digital and speechwriting staff for Gabbard. One person approached about the positions say that 2020 wasn\u2019t mentioned explicitly, but it was heavily implied.

She did not dispute, however, that Gabbard is considering joining what\u2019s expected to be a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders.\u201cI think everybody is focused on 2018, but we will see what happens after that,\u201d Batrice said in an interview. \u201cSomeone like Tulsi, with her experience, is an important voice in the party and the country.\u201d Top aides to Gabbard did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
