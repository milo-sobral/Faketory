Democrats on the other hand, are more than willing to try and use the hand of government to lower prices. And while Democrats have, so far, not been vocal supporters of the Trump plan, they have not completely dismissed it either. Therefore, there may be an opportunity to for the two sides to cooperate to a limited degree. But even a limited degree of cooperation is politically dicey for Democrats because providing Republicans with any victory on the drug price issue means it may be a less powerful issue for them in 2020.\u201dGOP RUSHES TO MATCH DEM DONATIONS: \u201cMitch McConnell stood before a roomful of Republican donors on Wednesday night to thank them for their help in the midterms,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports. \u201cBut the Senate leader also issued a dire warning: Democrats had just thumped them in the all-important online donor game, and the GOP badly needs to catch up. The heart of the problem, McConnell said at the event at party headquarters on Capitol Hill, is ActBlue. The Democratic fundraising tool funneled over $700 million in small donations to House and Senate candidates over the course of the 2018 campaign. The GOP leader said Republicans were getting swamped in the hunt for online givers and that he\u2019d charged his political team with coming up with a solution to enable them to compete in 2020.\u2014 \u201cMcConnell\u2019s push underscores the urgency confronting Republicans. In race after race, turbocharged liberal donors pumped cash into Democratic coffers \u2014 much of it through ActBlue, an easy-to-use site that allows givers to plug in their credit card information and send contributions to their candidate of choice with a click. Republicans have no such centralized fundraising platform. With the next campaign already on the horizon, Republicans view their online donor deficit \u2014 particularly acute in House races, but significant in Senate contests, too \u2014 as a primary obstacle.\u201d Full story.TODAY\u2019S NOTABLE FILINGS: : Rep.-elects Andy Levin (D-Mich.) and Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) set up leadership PACs.

TRUMP PROPERTIES RECEIVED $3.2 MILLION DURING MIDTERMS: \u201cCampaigns and PACs spent at least $3.2 million at Trump-owned and branded properties throughout the two-year midterm election cycle, a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission filings shows,\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright and Aaron Kessler report. \u201cAnd the total could rise after post-election financial reports are published by the commission. No single group spent more than the Republican National Committee, which spent at least $1.2 million at the properties since the start of 2017. About half of the RNC spending came in two installments -- $367,000 for travel expenses at Trump National Doral Miami in mid-June, after the group's spring meetings at the Florida club, and $222,000 for \u2018venue rental and catering\u2019 at Mar-A-Lago in March connected to fundraising events at the resort. Trump's own presidential reelection campaign was also among the groups spending the most at Trump properties throughout 2017 and 2018, despite not being on the ballot. The campaign has spent more than $950,000 at Trump properties since the start of 2017.\u201d Full story.Join POLITICO on Nov. 14 for special editorial conversations at \u201cThe Salute to Military Spouses,\u201d a half-day summit to raise awareness of the challenges and contributions of these unsung heroes.
