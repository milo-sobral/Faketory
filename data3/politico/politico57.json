We will condemn it wherever it rears its ugly head, and the president and I have done that forcefully,\u201d Pence said.Trump has come under heavy criticism for his long history of inflammatory comments and a spike in hate crimes in America during his tenure. He has also received widespread attention for attacking unspecified media outlets as the \"enemy of the people.\"Pence, who as a member of Congress strongly supported a federal shield law to protect journalists, told Playbook that he and Trump believe \u201cthe only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.\u201d\nBut the vice president slammed what he sees as sensationalist coverage connecting Trump to violence, echoing comments the president made on Monday to Fox News' Laura Ingraham.\u201cThe headline in one major newspaper didn\u2019t read, \u2018Bomb threat, perpetrator captured,\u2019 it actually made reference to President Trump in the headline, because this individual in some respect associated himself or was allegedly a supporter of ours,\u201d Pence said. \u201cNow, the president\u2019s no more responsible for this person\u2019s criminal behavior than Bernie Sanders was responsible for the man who opened fire on a Republican baseball team.\u201dPence also amplified the administration\u2019s controversial remarks about the caravan of Central American migrants gradually making its way toward the U.S. southern border to seek asylum.Without providing specific evidence, Pence said the caravan had been organized by \u201cleft-wing groups, political organizations within Honduras. It was likely financed in part by Venezuela.\u201d And he said law enforcement had told him the caravan includes Middle Easterners.Pence cast heavier deployments of the military to the border \u2014 as well as the idea floated by Trump this week of trying to undo the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship \u2014 as necessary responses to the \u201ccrisis on our southern border\u201d and \u201ca broken immigration system that\u2019s being used by people who literally are exploiting vulnerable people.\u201dAnd the vice president argued that people seeking to enter the country should do so legally, as his grandfather did at Ellis Island. (Seeking asylum at a port of entry is a legal method of entering the United States.)\nIn fact, border arrests this year are on par with numbers during the Obama administration and far below figures in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Pence dismissed the notion that Trump was stepping up immigration actions and rhetoric as a political ploy before the midterms. Asked about a fight in Congress over funding for a border wall in December, Pence said, \u201cThe two words the president most often uses are \u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d But then he took a firmer stand: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have that fight before Christmas arrives.\u201dHe also said he expected the \u201cblue wave\u201d that polls predict would crash into a \u201cred wall\u201d in next week\u2019s midterm elections.Missing out on the latest scoops?
