Papadopoulos elected not to mount such a challenge in his own case last year when Mueller\u2019s office charged him with making false statements and obstruction of justice resulting from Mueller\u2019s probe into alleged 2016 Russian election meddling.Story Continued BelowThe 31-year-old former campaign adviser instead cut a deal with Mueller\u2019s office and pleaded guilty to the false statement charge. In September, U.S. District Court Judge Randy Moss sentenced him to 14 days in prison.In the weeks since his sentencing, however, Papadopoulos has dramatically shifted his posture towards prosecutors \u2014 distancing himself from his previous defense lawyers and leveling public claims that federal prosecutors railroaded him and denied him access to key evidence. \u201cBiggest regret? Pleading guilty,\u201d he wrote in a Nov. 9 tweet that has since been deleted.The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

They argued instead that an appeal in another case \u2014 filed by a grand jury witness resisting a Mueller subpoena \u2014 raised serious issues about the special counsel\u2019s legitimacy and should be resolved before Papadopoulos is required to begin serving his sentence.\u201cIn light of the advanced stage of the appeal\u2026Mr. Papadopoulos faces the prospect of unnecessarily serving a sentence of incarceration for a conviction that may in the near future be reversed,\u201d his new lawyers, at the firm of Pierce Bainbridge, wrote. \u201cAbsent a stay of the execution of his sentence, the hardship and unfairness to Mr. Papadopoulos is palpable: he risks unnecessarily serving a sentence of incarceration that was unconstitutionally obtained,\u201d they added.Papadopoulos\u2019 approach towards Mueller\u2019s office grew even more combative after he testified behind closed doors last month to lawmakers from the House Judiciary and Oversight committees. While Papadopoulos has recently said he might seek to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of some type of misconduct by prosecutors or investigators, the Friday motion appears to rule out such a move.\u201cIf the appeal is unsuccessful, he will undoubtedly serve his sentence,\u201d the defense lawyers wrote.\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION\n                    By DARREN SAMUELSOHNA spokesman for Mueller\u2019s office, Peter Carr, declined to comment on whether prosecutors will resist the move.The exact date that Papadopoulos was scheduled to begin serving his sentence had not been publicly revealed before the defense motion was filed Friday. However, details about the defendant recently began appearing in the federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 public database, suggesting that his reporting date was imminent. It\u2019s also unclear exactly how long Papadopoulos would have to serve or where. A 14-day sentence is too short for a prisoner to receive so-called \u201cgood time\u201d credit, but he may be entitled to shave a day or two off his sentence because of a brief stay in FBI custody and at an Alexandria, Va. jail soon after he was arrested last year.In what may have been a prelude to Friday\u2019s motions, Papadopoulos\u2019 original lawyers, Tom Breen and Robert Stanley, formally asked to withdraw from the case on Tuesday and were officially discharged by Moss late that day. They said following Papadopoulos\u2019 sentencing hearing that they were unaware of any evidence of government misconduct in the case, or that their client had ever been the target of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant.Missing out on the latest scoops?
