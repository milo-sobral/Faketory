He said he wanted to \u201csend a message\u201d to those working pit the two against once another: that they would \u201cnot be able to do that as long as there is a King called Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and a crown prince called Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and a president in Turkey called Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\u201dTurkey and Saudi Arabia are regional rivals in the Middle East who have jockeyed for influence and power among their neighbors as well as within the Muslim world.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The Saudi crown prince\u2019s comments pledging cooperation with the Turkish government followed demands from Erdo\u011fan that those responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s killing face justice, \u201cfrom the highest ranked to the lowest.\u201d In remarks to Turkey\u2019s parliament, Erdo\u011fan said plans to kill Khashoggi were hatched days before he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and that the journalist was murdered by a team of Saudi assassins. Erdo\u011fan's claims directly refute the kingdom\u2019s account that the 59-year old journalist died during an interrogation that escalated into a fistfight. Turkey has also implicated possession of evidence that Khashoggi was tortured and dismembered, and died in the consulate on Oct. 2. The Saudi journalist, who was living in exile in the U.S., was critical of the Saudi monarchy. While scores of powerful executives and top officials boycotted the conference, the crown prince, who has cast a carefully fashioned image as a reformer in the strict Arab kingdom, received standing ovations in two appearances thus far. Responding to a moderator's question, the 33-year old prince emphasized that he is cooperating with the Turkish government and plans to \u201cpresent perpetrators to court.\u201d As the moderator pivoted from the journalist\u2019s slaying to the economies of the Middle East, the crown prince said \u201cthe new Europe is the Middle East,\u201d and then added that \u201cthe kingdom of Saudi Arabia in five years will be totally different.\u201d\nForeign Policy \n                    By ALENA SADIQ and NAHAL TOOSI In Washington, President Donald Trump for the first time during the three-week long international uproar pronounced the latest official Saudi account as \u201cthe worst cover-up ever,\u201d reversing course after initially withholding criticism of the oil-rich kingdom\u2019s leaders.\u201cThey had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups, very simple,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.The administration responded by revoking the visas of 21 Saudis suspected of involvement in the journalist\u2019s death. CIA Director Gina Haspel is also expected to return to Washington on Wednesday to brief the president on her talks with Turkish officials.Missing out on the latest scoops?
