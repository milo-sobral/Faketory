Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). Since he took office, Trump has missed no opportunity to bash CNN and its reporting, including once tweeting an edited video of himself appearing to body-slam and punch a CNN logo. Last week, at a rally in Montana, Trump praised Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter, for which the congressman pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor assault. CNN correspondent Jim Acosta said a Trump supporter made a throat-slitting gesture toward him at the same event, and journalists have reported feeling increasingly unsafe at Trump rallies.\"I don't like 'em either,\" Trump said of reporters Monday night in Houston as his fans yelled \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d a recurring chant at the president\u2019s rallies.

These cowardly acts are unacceptable and won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201dJust two hours after the suspected explosive device was found at CNN, the Trump 2020 campaign sent out a fundraising email bashing the network and the rest of the media. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to give the media another wake-up call,\u201d the email read. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale later apologized, saying it was a \u201cpre-programmed, automated message.\"Press advocates have long said Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward the media endangers journalists, who he has labeled \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\nCrime\n                    By REBECCA MORINThe package delivered to CNN was addressed to John Brennan, the former CIA director under Obama and a frequent critic of Trump. Brennan is a contributor at NBC News and MSNBC, not CNN.CNN employees evacuated their New York offices shortly after 10 a.m. Anchors Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto were covering the suspicious packages sent to the Obamas and Clintons when an alarm went off, and staffers could be seen behind them heading for the exits. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire alarm here,\u201c Harlow told guest Tom Fuentes, a senior law enforcement analyst, and CNN's Washington studio took over the broadcast. Fifteen minutes later, Harlow and Sciutto appeared live outside the Time Warner Center on shaky video and speaking into cell phones amid a heavy police presence. For hours, CNN\u2019s coverage shifted from the Washington studio to anchors and correspondents on the street in midtown Manhattan. While broadcasting on the street Wednesday afternoon, Chris Cuomo interviewed Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), who said the president \u201cshouldn't refer to the press as the 'enemy of the people'\u201d and that \u201cwe all need to watch the rhetoric that we use.\u201dCNN journalists noted on air that the president hadn't mentioned the network on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s as if it can\u2019t roll off the tongue unless you\u2019re complaining about it,\u201d CNN analyst Gloria Borger said.Missing out on the latest scoops?
