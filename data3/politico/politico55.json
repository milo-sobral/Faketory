The Boston Globe storyA FEW NUGGETS FROM OUR INTERVIEW WITH V.P. MIKE PENCE \u2026 -- ON TRYING TO END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP \u2026 PENCE said, \u201cWe all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language in the 14th Amendment, \u2018subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u2019 applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally.\u201d-- QUICK FACT-CHECK from CAITLIN OPRYSKO and TED HESSON: \u201cThe issue of whether birthright citizenship could be applied to children born to non-U.S. citizens was the focus of an 1898 Supreme Court ruling. In U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the court held that a man born to Chinese-national parents in the U.S. was in fact a U.S. citizen.\u201d POLITICO-- THE VP did not endorse Kevin McCarthy to be the next top House Republican. \u201cI support having a Republican speaker of the House.\u201d But he said McCarthy has done a \u201ctremendous job\u201d as House majority leader, while noting that others \u201chave expressed interest.\u201d-- WE ASKED HIM how he squared his historic support for the press with PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP calling reporters the enemy of the people. Pence said he and Trump believe that \u201cthe only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.\u201d But he slammed media coverage that connected Trump\u2019s rhetoric to last week\u2019s mail bombs or right-wing extremism. \u201cThat to me was an example of the media going too far \u2026 instead of just reporting the straight facts.\u201d-- HE REJECTED THAT HEATED RHETORIC had anything to do with the shooting in Pittsburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t connect those acts to the public debate,\u201d including the pipe bombs sent to prominent Democratic figures last week. \u201cWe will not let violence or anti-Semitism take hold in the United States of America. We will condemn it wherever it rears its ugly head, and the president and I have done that forcefully.\u201d-- WE ASKED if Pence would be on Trump\u2019s 2020 ticket. He said: it \u201cwould be the greatest honor of my life to serve a second term with this president. \u2026 The last two years have just been an incredible experience.\u201d Video of the entire eventTHE LATEST FROM PITTSBURGH \u2026 \u201cTrump to console Pittsburgh alone as local, congressional leaders skip visit,\u201d by Jesus Rodriguez: \u201cA spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto\u2019s office confirmed that the mayor will be attending funerals as Trump arrives in town. Peduto, a Democrat, previously urged Trump to consider \u2018the will of the families\u2019 and to avoid a visit \u2018while we are burying the dead.\u2019 \u2026\u201cThe four top congressional leaders in both parties \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), as well as Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2014 were invited to join Trump in Pittsburgh but declined, according to a source familiar with the matter. But that move isn't necessarily a sign of eagerness to avoid Trump by the GOP leaders \u2014 both McConnell and Ryan had previous commitments with the midterms just one week away.\u201d POLITICO MICHAEL CALDERONE (@mlcalderone): \u201cNY Times evacuated its London office today because of suspicious package -- police issued all-clear and staff returned. This follows suspicious envelope -- later deemed harmless -- yesterday at the NYC newsroom.\u201dGood Tuesday afternoon. FROM CALIFORNIA PLAYBOOK -- SPLIT-UP OF POWERHOUSE FIRM ... \u201cAfter 25 years of crafting political campaigns with one of the most successful teams in state politics. the \u2018N\u2019 of the powerhouse SF-based campaign consulting firm, SCN Strategies -- Dan Newman -- has decided to split from the firm he co-founded at the end of this year, POLITICO has learned. ...\u201cA seasoned operative with a reputation for no-holds-barred politics, Newman told POLITICO that he\u2019s \u2018looking forward to a new chapter\u2019 -- and emphasized the amicable nature of his decision, saying \u2018the folks at SCN are the smartest and most successful in the business, and they'll continue to win at every level, doing ever bigger and better things.\u2019 One of those things, political observers suggest, is likely to be SCN\u2019s involvement with a 2020 presidential campaign by [Sen. Kamala] Harris, who has been visiting Iowa and South Carolina, and is widely viewed as a prospective candidate.\u201dSign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!\u201d\u2026 at 11:10 a.m.: \u201cJust out: Consumer Confidence hits highest level since 2000.\u201dA message from Delta Air Lines:Connecting armed service members with their loved ones while they undergo treatment and recovery is a small way to say thank you to the men and women who bravely serve us.

Men are still making the large majority of political contributions, and male candidates are still raising more money.\u201cFemale candidates have relied on different or new ways to raise money, getting more in small donations, from individual donors and from women. Still, even in a year when fervor for a \u2018blue wave\u2019 has allowed many competitive female candidates to raise staggering amounts of money, it has taken them longer to raise it.\u201d NYT -- JAMES ARKIN and ALEX THOMPSON with a Kansas City, Mo., dateline: \u201cWill Democrats blow it with black voters again?\u201d: \u201cCan the party energize and turn out black voters in 2018 in ways they so spectacularly failed to do in 2016? National black political activists said the Democratic Party\u2019s failure to prepare for President Barack Obama's departure from the White House \u2014 and the drop-off in minority voting that was likely to follow \u2014 goes back years. \u2026 \u201cIn Missouri, conversations with nearly a dozen elected officials, activists and voters reveal a mixture of cautious optimism and concern about whether McCaskill has done enough to secure high turnout here in Kansas City and in St. Louis \u2026 African-American progressive activists across the country say that the national party appears to be taking their concerns more seriously this year than in recent election cycles.\u201d POLITICO-- WSJ\u2019S DANTE CHINNI and AARON ZITNER in Harrisburg, Pa.: \u201cGOP Works to Rally the Trump Skeptics Within Party\u201d: \u201cIn most years, the congressional district here wouldn\u2019t be in play. The GOP holds a six-point advantage in party registration, and the region has a tradition of voting Republican. But the GOP majority here rests in part on a certain kind of voter: relatively affluent suburbanites who are skeptical of President Trump\u2019s leadership or oppose him altogether.\u201cThey represent the pre-Trump Republican Party, and GOP leaders worry they may sit out the midterms, an option the party can ill-afford in hard-fought House races. \u2026 As is the case in Pennsylvania, many party Republicans are clustered around state capitals \u2026 That means the party has to work to motivate this type of Republican in Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th District and others with a large number of college-educated, suburban residents earning higher incomes.\u201d WSJ -- VOX\u2019S ELLA NILSEN: \u201cExclusive: Republicans are outspending Democrats 5 to 1 in key statehouse races\u201d-- WSJ\u2019S REID EPSTEIN in Roswell, Ga.: \u201cGeorgia House Race Shows Educated Women Are Midterm Prize\u201d: \u201cGOP Rep. Karen Handel is vying to retain the House seat she won in a special election last year, which, at $60 million, was the most expensive House race ever. Both her campaign and that of Democratic challenger Lucy McBath\u2014along with scores across the country\u2014are drawing from the experience of that June 2017 election \u2026 \u201c[A]fter campaigning in the special election with President Trump with funding from House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s super PAC, Ms. Handel is now pitching herself as an independent voice focused on local issues, a shift that has accompanied falling approval ratings for Mr. Trump in the district.\u201d WSJ AD WARS -- NBC\u2019S SUZANNE GAMBOA in Austin, Texas: \u201cDemocrats launch first multi-state Spanish language TV ad to turn out Latino vote\u201d: \u201cThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than a half million dollars to run the ad on Univision, Telemundo and other stations in eight large media markets.\u201d NBC \u2026 The adFIGHTING PHARMA -- \u201cPharma\u2019s \u2018come-to-Jesus moment\u2019: The industry braces for a Pelosi speakership and Democrats\u2019 drug pricing agenda,\u201d by Stat\u2019s Lev Facher: \u201cNancy Pelosi marched into PhRMA\u2019s offices this July with the law on her side. Never mind that the law in question has never been put to use: Pelosi spoke in detailed terms of a federal statute that allows the U.S. government to effectively strip drug companies of exclusive licenses to some blockbuster medicines. ... \u201cThe boardroom ambush from Washington\u2019s most powerful Democrat could prove the first of many such moments for drug manufacturers, which have come under fire from the White House and lawmakers from both parties in the past two years. Interviews with drug industry lobbyists and Democratic aides across the Capitol suggest the same: that the wing of Pelosi\u2019s party outlining an ambitious agenda to combat high drug costs could turn 2019 into PhRMA\u2019s doomsday scenario.\u201d Stat THE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026 WSJ\u2019S DREW FITZGERALD and SHELBY HOLLIDAY: \u201cMueller Investigators Probe Roger Stone Conference Calls\u201d: \u201cIn at least two August [2016] conference calls advertised online to the public and promoting himself as \u201cthe ultimate political insider,\u201d Mr. Stone told callers about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to release information that he said would affect the 2016 presidential campaign before the election.\u201d WSJSPOTTED: Newt and Callista Gingrich yesterday at the Delta Sky Club in the Minneapolis airport, heading to DCA in first class on Delta 1689.SPOTTED at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund awards gala Monday night at the Washington Marriott Wardman Park Hotel: Rep.
