They\u2019re suspicious of favorable polls and making election night contingency plans in case their worst fears come true. Some report literal nightmares about a Democratic wipeout.\u201cWe're kind of just in the bed-wetting phase now,\" said Democratic pollster John Anzalone, a Hillary Clinton campaign alumnus who spent election night 2016 in Clinton\u2019s Manhattan war room.Two years later, even thinking about the prospect of a repeat of that night\u2019s letdown is still too much for many Democrats to bear.\u201cStop it!\u201d shouted Nadeam Elshami, a former chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, when asked about that possibility. To be fair, the possibility has literally haunted his dreams.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

His dream concluded with a Democratic House, but he doesn\u2019t consider that a prophecy, and he said the pre-election knot in his stomach is tighter this year than ever before.Anzalone said the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s upset victory, which was missed by most forecasts, still hangs over many in the party. \u201cThere\u2019s some PTSD,\u201d he said.That is not an exaggeration. A study published last month in the Journal of American College Health found that one-quarter of college students experienced \u201cclinically significant\u201d symptoms of trauma from the 2016 election results. At Vassar College in upstate New York, the college Democrats are moving their results-watching party to a new venue over concerns that revisiting the scene of their 2016 letdown would be too upsetting for some students, according to a member of the group. At Brown University in Rhode Island, the College Democrats have taken the same precaution after experiencing a \u201ccollective flashback\u201d to Trump\u2019s victory during a discussion of election night planning.A September AP/MTV poll found that 61 percent of Democrats ages 15 to 34 reported feeling anxious over the midterms, up 22 percentage points from July.But pre-midterm stress syndrome isn\u2019t afflicting only young people: A YouGov survey released Friday found that Democrats are 50 percent more likely than Republicans to report that they are \u201ceating their feelings\u201d ahead of the midterms. Other recent polling has registered high levels of stress among Democrats ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.For many traumatized Democrats, heading into Tuesday feels like flying again after surviving a plane crash. Some say the stakes feel even higher than in 2016: It was one thing for Trump to win in an electoral fluke, despite losing the popular vote, when he was still a political newcomer. It will be downright terrifying, they say, if Americans can\u2019t place a check on him after two years of his megalomaniacal rule. \"I'm old enough to remember when The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85 percent chance of winning on election night and to have been traumatized by the New York Times election needle,\" said Ezra Levin, who co-founded the Resistance organization Indivisible with his wife, Leah, after their election night gathering turned into the worst house party of their lives.\nElections\n                    By DAVID SIDERS, ELANA SCHOR, JAMES ARKIN, DANIEL STRAUSS, CARLA MARINUCCI, STEVEN SHEPARD and TIM ALBERTAMany liberals consider it bad luck \u2014 or, worse, an excuse for apathy \u2014 to embrace talk of big Democratic gains on Tuesday.When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi predicted to \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert last week that Democrats \u201cwill win\u201d the House, the liberal comedian worried she might be jinxing the outcome.\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that,\u201d Colbert replied. \u201cDo you want to say that on Hillary\u2019s fireworks barge that she canceled?\u201d (Clinton\u2019s campaign had prepared a fireworks display to celebrate her expected 2016 win.)Perhaps reflecting a once-bitten, twice-shy mentality, national Democratic leaders had not announced election night plans as of press time. In 2006, the last time they waged a midterm campaign against an unpopular incumbent, they rang in their landslide victory with an all-night, open bar bash at which over 1,000 revelers spread across two ballrooms at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill.Democrats still have plenty of worst-case-scenarios to fret over. Though the House map favors them, control of the chamber comes down to roughly 30 toss-up races. Assuming the polls are not systematically flawed, Republicans would have to win roughly twice as many of those toss-ups as Democrats to maintain control of the chamber, a feat that is unlikely but far from impossible.Young and minority voters \u2014 whose turnout tends to drop significantly in midterm years \u2014 are showing greater than normal enthusiasm this cycle, but if they end up turning out in typical midterm numbers, Democrats could fall short.Meanwhile, polling shows bleak Democratic odds for wrenching the Senate away from Republicans, meaning that just two dozen to three dozen House races will decide whether Democrats have any real legislative and oversight power for the next two years.\nPolitics\n                    By CHARLIE MAHTESIANAnother important wild card is the group of new and irregular voters who turned out for Trump in 2016 \u2014 a group whose behavior pollsters have found hard to predict. It remains unclear how many will vote without Trump\u2019s name on the ballot, but the president has courted them hard, and a strong turnout could deliver a better-than-expected showing for Republicans.Democrats are also agonizing over exotic threats they\u2019ve never had to worry about before \u2014 including the prospect of undetected foreign interference. A recent Pew survey found that Democrats are far more stressed than Republicans about the threat of voting systems being hacked.All that anxiety does have a silver lining for the left: motivation.\u201cThere's this feeling that we're losing until we win,\" said Levin, who has visited with activists campaigning across the country. \u201cNone of them I talked to is confident and planning on a win,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery one of them doesn't trust the polls, doesn't trust that this is in the bag.\u201dFor Democrats like these, haunted by \u201cthe ghosts of 2016,\u201d Anzalone predicted that \u201cTuesday will be an exorcism.\u201dUnless it\u2019s not, right?\"That made me want to say, \u2018Fuck you,\u2019\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cBut yes. Yes.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
