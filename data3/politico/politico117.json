If he misbehaves, we'll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference.\u201d\"If they don't listen to the rules and regulations,\" he told reporters at a separate event at the White House, \"we'll end up back in court, and we'll win.\"The race for 2020 starts now.

It was Trump and Sanders, after all, who escalated the Acosta situation after a dispute at a news conference by yanking his press pass and, to justify it, pointing to an apparently altered video of his interaction with a White House aide. Now, future legal encounters appear certain, as journalists deemed to have broken the rules are also likely to take the administration to court.The situation is akin to having a \u201csword hanging over our heads,\u201d said New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker. \u201cIt leaves this idea that they are going to be the judge of who gets to cover them based on some probably arbitrary criteria that they will be the only ones to determine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe idea that suddenly you\u2019re going to try to determine who is polite enough to ask the president questions is just kind of ridiculous.\u201dWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Olivier Knox said Friday afternoon that the White House had not reached out to him for input on any new rules for reporter behavior.\u201cAs the organization that defends the interest of a free and independent news media at the White House, we have our role to play, but what that role will be, I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.The White House might see political victory in battling the media, but the court ruling Friday was a legal win for CNN, long a favorite target of Trump's. Federal Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration had denied Acosta due process in revoking his security pass, citing shifting White House explanations, no clear process, no advance notification to Acosta and no chance for him to rebut the allegations. Kelly ordered the White House to return Acosta\u2019s credential on a temporary basis, while the rest of the case moves forward. \nwhite house\n                    By ANNIE KARNIThe White House did not reply to questions Friday about whether it would continue fighting Acosta and CNN in court. But Trump has kept up a confrontational stance with reporters in the past two weeks.He berated CNN's Abby Phillip for asking a \u201cstupid question,\u201d after she asked whether he wanted acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to rein in the Russia investigation. And at the same news conference in which he tussled with Acosta, Trump accused Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS NewsHour\" of asking a \u201cracist question\u201d when she brought up his use of the phrase \u201cnationalist\u201d and its links to white nationalism.\u201cAcosta is one thing, but I think they tip their hand by going after people like Abby Phillip and going after Yamiche Alcindor, who have done nothing but show how professional they are,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThis is meant to intimidate.\u201d Trump's frustration with relatively straightforward questions such as those will almost certainly lead reporters to wonder whether they are being targeted for their coverage, not their behavior.CNN has argued that was the case with Acosta, alleging that the White House yanked his hard pass \u2014 which allows reporters to freely enter and exit the grounds \u2014 because it was attempting to stifle coverage it disliked, in violation of the First Amendment. But Kelly did not address that in his ruling, saying only that Acosta's due process rights were clearly violated. Now, the administration says it's creating a process for banning reporters who do not show \u201cdecorum\u201d at events.In excerpts of the Fox News interview \u2014 which will air in full Sunday \u2014 Wallace asked Trump what the rules for reporters should be. \"You can't keep asking questions,\" the president replied. \"We had a lot of reporters in that room, many, many reporters in that room, and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts ... just shouting out questions. And making statements, too.\"Trump added, \u201cBut I will say this: Nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do. And if I think somebody is acting out of sorts, I will leave and say, 'Thank you very much. Thanks for coming.' And I'll leave. Those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that's acting up.\u201d\nWhite House\n                    By JESUS RODRIGUEZThe White House will have broad discretion in formulating rules for reporters\u2019 behavior, so long as none of them discriminate against anyone based on their views or coverage, said Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\u201cThe fight will likely be over how they\u2019re applied,\u201d she said.Once the new rules are established, the White House likely would not be able to kick out Acosta, or anyone else, for past offenses, said Nathan Siegel, a First Amendment lawyer with Davis Wright Tremaine who previously served as in-house counsel for ABC.\u201cProbably the biggest question is whether it will use those rules to try to eject reporters, whether it\u2019s Acosta or others, in the future,\u201d Siegel said.He said any reporter ejected from the White House under the new rules and procedures would be able to challenge them in court. The result could be an ongoing carousel of legal fights between Trump and the press \u2014 something the president seems to relish.In the case of Acosta, Baker said the White House has an easy solution before it.\u201cIf they really think that Jim Acosta is too rude, don\u2019t call on him,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want what\u2019s happening right now. They want to be in a war with us.\u201dGabby Orr contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?
