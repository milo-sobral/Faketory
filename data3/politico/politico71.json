Thom Tillis on Sunday expressed support for President Donald Trump\u2019s move to put more troops on the U.S.-Mexico border in response to an approaching caravan of Central-American migrants seeking asylum.Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d the North Carolina Republican said, \u201cI believe that the president is right and doing everything he can to stop the illegal process.\u201dStory Continued Below\u201cThe president is right that we have to secure the border, and I think that putting troops down there to make it very clear that we want people who have a legitimate claim to asylum to come through the process and get that asylum granted,\u201d said Tillis, the vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.The Trump administration began sending as many as 15,000 troops to the southern border to meet a caravan of Central American asylum seekers heading toward the U.S. through Mexico.The president sparked controversy when he said the U.S. military should treat any rocks or stones thrown by migrants as firearms. Later, he later walked back the comment, declaring that any lawbreakers would be arrested.Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on Sunday slammed Trump for his initial comment.Appearing on the same Fox show, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said: \u201cIt was pretty ridiculous for the president to suggest the other day that the United States military would fire on unarmed people, and the military had to tell the president \u2018That\u2019s not what we do. That\u2019s not what the United States military does.\u2019\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
