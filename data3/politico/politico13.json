Bernie Sanders on Friday agreed with Joe Biden \u2014 a fellow septuagenarian \u2014 that age will be an issue if he runs for president in 2020.But he added, \u201cI\u2019m very blessed with my health.\u201dStory Continued Below\u201cIt\u2019s part of a discussion, but it has to be part of an overall view of what somebody is and what somebody has accomplished,\u201d Sanders, who is 77, told POLITICO. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got people who are 50 years of age who are not well, right? You\u2019ve got people who are 90 years of age who are going to work every day doing excellent work. And obviously, age is a factor. But it depends on the overall health and well being of the individual.\u201dSanders\u2019 remarks came after Biden, who turns 76 next month, acknowledged age would be a \"legitimate issue\" if he runs for president.\"I think they're gonna judge me on my vitality,\" Biden told \"CBS This Morning\" this week. \"Can I still run up the steps of Air Force Two? Am I still in good shape? Am I \u2013 do I have all my faculties? Am I energetic?

And President Donald Trump is 72. But a crop of younger Democrats is preparing to run, as well. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), are taking aggressive steps in early primary states, among other candidates. Earlier this week, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) proposed a new tax break for average Americans, calling for a $6,000 tax credit for families earning up to $100,000.Sanders declined to comment on the proposal, saying, \u201cI just heard about it yesterday\u201d and that he wants to \u201cstudy the implications.\u201dBut he said he has taken heart in more progressive policy proposals from Democrats since his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2016.\u201cWhat people perceive is this country\u2019s in a very different place than it was three years ago,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think we opened up the door for people to understand that the American people want real change.\u201dNow, Sanders said, \u201cYou\u2019re seeing candidates coming up with ideas to try to address those issues.\u201dSanders, who touched off a nine-state tour stumping for Democrats on Friday, has not yet said if he will run for president again. On Friday, he briskly walked several blocks with supporters to a voting center from a rally for Democratic congressional candidate Liz Watson, who is challenging Republican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth.Asked later about his age, he said, \u201cI am very happy that \u2013 and I thank God for this, I\u2019m very lucky \u2013 I\u2019m very blessed with my health \u2026 I literally cannot remember the last time I missed a day because of illness.
