Last year, Trump tweeted a video of himself tackling a man with a CNN logo superimposed across his face, adding the hashtag #FraudNewsCNN. And just last week, he made light of a Republican congressman who was convicted of assault for body-slamming a reporter. Story Continued BelowAmid disturbing reports that explosive devices were sent to some of the president's top political enemies by one or more unknown persons, Trump\u2019s critics say he has a reckless penchant for, at a minimum, celebrating violence against his enemies \u2014 and, at worst, inciting it.But the president embraced a very different message on Wednesday, decrying \u201cpolitical violence\u201d and presenting himself as a bipartisan healer during remarks at the White House, touching off an unexpected national debate about political discourse that itself quickly grew divisive, with left and right each accusing the other of bad faith.\u201cThose engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective,\u201d a staid Trump said Wednesday night at the start of a rally in Wisconsin, adding later, \u201cBy the way, do you see how nice I\u2019m behaving today?

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who called on activists to confront administration officials, should \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201dSuspicious packages, some of which reportedly included explosive devices, were sent to all five of those Democrats, prompting outrage from Trump\u2019s critics.\u201cThere is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,\u201d CNN President Jeff Zucker said in a statement. \u201cThe president, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump\u2019s condemnations of the attacks \u201cring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.\u201d\u201cTime and time again, the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,\u201d they said.Despite Trump\u2019s sober tone Wednesday, few around him expect him to change fundamentally over the longer term. One person close to the president simply laughed when asked whether Trump would scrap the divisive rhetoric that helped send him to the White House.And during his Wednesday rally, Trump couldn\u2019t help but take some shots at the media and the Democrats. \u201cThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories,\u201d he said on the same day that CNN evacuated its New York office after an unknown person delivered an explosive device to the news outlet. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to stop.\u201d \nCrime\n                    By REBECCA MORINLater, Trump accused Democrats of being soft on illegal immigration and joked, \u201cGo out and vote. Now, if you\u2019re going to vote Democrat, don\u2019t bother.\u201dEarlier Wednesday, as the suspicious-package story blanketed the cable television airwaves, Trump expressed outrage about the incidents, stressing that the \u201csafety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority.\u201d\u201cI just want to tell you that in these times, we have to unify, we have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America,\u201d he said, speaking at a previously scheduled event on opioids.He continued, \u201cWe\u2019re extremely angry, upset and unhappy about what we witnessed this morning, and we will get to the bottom of it.\u201dFirst lady Melania Trump, speaking at the beginning of the event, echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe cannot tolerate those cowardly attacks, and I strongly condemn all that choose violence,\u201d she said.In addition to demonizing several recipients of the packages, Trump has applauded supporters who assaulted protesters at his 2016 campaign events and characterized Democrats as leading an \u201cangry, ruthless, unhinged mob.\u201dWhile many liberals have outright accused Trump of inciting political violence himself, conservatives have also pointed a finger back at Democrats, in what promised to become a larger debate about American political discourse ahead of the midterm elections.They note that some Democrats, including Waters, have called on Trump critics to confront administration officials in public spaces like restaurants and denounce administration policies. Some conservatives complained Wednesday that liberals have been quick to use words like \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cNazi\u201d to describe Trump and his allies.At the Wednesday rally, Trump made a veiled reference to his frustrations with liberals\u2019 rhetoric. \u201cNo one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe should not mob people in public space or destroy public property.\u201dOne former senior White House official who spoke to Trump officials Wednesday said the Trump team would note that the president\u2019s children have been subjected to death threats and themselves received suspicious packages, calling it \u201coutrageous\u201d to link the bombs to Trump.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on here, and it would be odd to start placing blame before we really know what people are being blamed for,\u201d said Yuval Levin, acting president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. \u201cTrump\u2019s tone is unbecoming of a president and it\u2019s certainly damaging to the political culture, but you would have to make some connection here before placing blame.\u201dThe former White House official said that Republicans also plan to remind the public about a shooting last year at a congressional baseball practice \u2014 carried out by a left-wing activist \u2014 that nearly claimed the life of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\nMedia \n                    By JASON SCHWARTZ and MICHAEL CALDERONE And Trump himself has argued that the true threat of violence in America comes from the left \u2014 particularly the far-left movement antifa.In a closed-door meeting with evangelical leaders in August, he warned that Democrats \u201cwill overturn everything that we\u2019ve done and they\u2019ll do it quickly and violently\u201d if they win back the House. \u201cWhen you look at antifa and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people,\u201d he added.Other White House officials on Wednesday condemned the bomb packages, including Vice President Mike Pence, who tweeted a condemnation which, unlike Trump\u2019s remarks, explicitly named several of the targets, including CNN. (Trump retweeted the tweet, adding \u201cI agree wholeheartedly!\u201d)\u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. (Sanders did not immediately respond to a request for comment about criticism of Trump\u2019s past divisive rhetoric.)Trump was briefed on the suspicious packages on Wednesday. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, FBI Director Christopher Wray, U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles were among the officials who participated in the briefing.In the wake of the reports of suspicious packages, Republicans and Democrats alike briefly hit the pause button on an acrimonious campaign season, coming together \u2014 at least for a moment \u2014 to call for civility.They included Scalise, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cViolence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society.\u201dEven the president\u2019s often-combative son, Eric, tweeted a message of sympathy for the Democrats who were targeted \u2014 and said that he too had been sent suspicious packages.\u201cAs someone who has been on the receiving end of [threatening] packages, I can tell you how disgusting these acts are! America is better than this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese acts should be condemned by all and I hope they throw any individual caught in jail, for a very long time.\"As the latest debate about political speech unfolded, insiders from both parties expressed doubt that the president, for one, would change his rhetorical ways.\u201cIt\u2019ll never happen. It is who he is,\u201d said GOP strategist Alex Castellanos.\u201cYou really can\u2019t have the good of Trump without the disruption because that disruption is his core and the very reason people sent him to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sent him to Washington to break all of the china. Occasionally a piece or two is grandma\u2019s prized piece on the shelf.\u201dEliana Johnson contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?
