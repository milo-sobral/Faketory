BARABAK -- a Bay Area-based political correspondent -- went on the trail to Miami to interview NANCY PELOSI. Pelosi is crossing the country, trying to whip up support for Democrats. Pelosi said this: \u201cI see myself as a transitional figure \u2026 I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\u201d The L.A. Times storyLET\u2019S GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY FIRST: Nancy Pelosi is the undoubted favorite to be speaker of the House if Democrats take back the majority. The question to most Democratic insiders was: how will she do it? And now a question will be: how does she define transitional?A TRANSITIONAL SPEAKER -- an argument Steny Hoyer has tried to make -- would be a way for Pelosi to get to the speakership. People who would\u2019ve otherwise voted against her might recognize that she did, indeed, help get the majority back for Democrats, and could be persuaded to vote for her if it is a short-term proposition.THERE ARE LOTS OF BENEFITS to Pelosi\u2019s return to the speakership. She has institutional knowledge that no one else has in setting up a majority. She\u2019s been there before. People will ask, though, how long she will want to stay around.THIS MOVE WOULD also set up a try-out period for would-be members of the Democratic leadership. Democrats will be clawing at each other to prove their mettle -- but that could be a healthy process in a Democratic leadership that has been stagnant for years.

Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri. \u2026 Ever since he disappeared on Oct. 2 while visiting the mission, Saudi officials have repeatedly said that he left the consulate alive and that they had no information on his whereabouts or fate. \u2026 \u2018Do you think I can act by myself without taking orders/guidance?\u2019 Qahtani said last year in a tweet that is being widely shared now after the announcement of his firing. \u2018I am an employee and a trustworthy executive to the orders of the king and the crown prince.\u2019\u201d WaPo-- WAPO\u2019S SHANE HARRIS: \u201cSaudi claims that Khashoggi died in a \u2018brawl\u2019 draw immediate skepticism\u201d: \u201cClaims by the government of Saudi Arabia that Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi died in a physical altercation inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul drew immediate skepticism and contradicted earlier dueling accounts from Saudi and Turkish officials.\u201cThe Saudi findings, which all but absolved the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, increased pressure on the Trump administration to mount an independent investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death.\u201cCIA officials have listened to an audio recording that Turkish officials say proves the journalist was killed and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate, according to people familiar with the matter. If verified, the recording would make it difficult for the White House to accept the Saudi version that Khashoggi\u2019s death was effectively an accident. A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment. ... Current and former U.S. intelligence officials, foreign policy experts and lawmakers were quick to accuse the Saudi government of a whitewash.\u201d WaPoA message from Delta Air Lines:Connecting armed service members with their loved ones while they undergo treatment and recovery is a small way to say thank you to the men and women who bravely serve us.

(@timkaine): \u201cThe Saudi \u2018explanation\u2019 for murdering journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi in a consulate\u2014a fistfight gone wrong\u2014is insulting. Since the Trump Administration won\u2019t stand up against atrocity, Congress must.\u201d \u2026 \u2026 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) (@LindseyGrahamSC): \u201cTo say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement. \u2026 First we were told Mr. Khashoggi supposedly left the consulate and there was blanket denial of any Saudi involvement. Now, a fight breaks out and he\u2019s killed in the consulate, all without knowledge of Crown Prince. ... It\u2019s hard to find this latest \u2018explanation\u2019 as credible.\u201d\u2026 SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS CHAIRMAN BOB CORKER (R-TENN.) (@SenBobCorker): \u201cThe story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water. \u2026 They can undergo their own investigation, but the U.S. administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder under the Global Magnitsky investigation as required by law.\u201dBUT! \u2026 NYT HEADLINE: \u201cTrump, Breaking With U.S. Intelligence, Appears to Accept Saudi Explanation of Journalist\u2019s Death\u201d-- NYT\u2019S BEN HUBBARD in Beirut and DAVID KIRKPATRICK in Istanbul: \u201cUproar Over Dissident Rattles Saudi Royal Family\u201d: \u201cThe one person who could intervene is the king himself, but senior princes have found it nearly impossible to bring their concerns to the 82-year-old monarch, and some doubt he is fully aware of what is happening or willing to change course. ... \u2018They aren\u2019t a particularly draconian bunch,\u2019 said another longtime associate of the royal family, describing the philosophy of some princes as, \u2018We just want to eat burgers and go on foreign holidays.\u2019\u201cAssociates of the royal family say that senior princes don\u2019t have the access to King Salman that they had to previous kings, making it hard to voice concerns. Some princes cannot enter the royal court or the king\u2019s palace unless their names have been placed at the door ahead of time, one member of the royal family complained. \u201cOtherwise, they see the king at official events where it is considered bad form to raise thorny issues or they visit him at night when he is playing cards, also a bad time for serious talk.\u201d NYTIT SEEMS INCREASINGLY LIKELY that Congress is going to brawl in December over curbing arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

He was talked out of it by advisers who highlighted the effect such a measure would have on more than $600 billion in U.S.-Mexico annual trade, as well as the potential damage to bilateral relations, according to the officials.\u201d WaPo-- NYT\u2019S EMILY COCHRANE (@ESCochrane): \u201cI asked President Trump what evidence he had that \u2018hardened criminals\u2019 are trying to enter the country. \u2018Oh please, please, don\u2019t be a baby,\u2019 was his response.\u201dDOH! \u2026 BURGESS EVERETT and ELANA SCHOR: \u201cAir wars: Hawley flies on lobbyist's plane after blasting McCaskill\u201d: \u201cJosh Hawley has criticized Democratic Sen.

Hawley attended a West Virginia fundraiser on that day, social media posts show, before returning to Springfield, Missouri that night \u2013 and posting a Facebook video of him driving into the city for a rally with President Donald Trump the next day.\u201d POLITICOMANAFORT UPDATE \u2026 DARREN SAMUELSOHN and JOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cManafort in wheelchair, facing \u2018significant issues\u2019 with health\u201d: \u201cFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort appeared in federal court in a wheelchair on Friday and his lawyer said he\u2019s dealing with \u2018significant issues\u2019 tied to his health because of his confinement at a Northern Virginia jail. \u201cThe attorney, Kevin Downing, didn\u2019t specify what the problem was in open court but a source familiar with the situation later explained the longtime GOP operative who has been confined since mid-June is dealing with an issue related to his diet and has inflammation in his foot. Manafort, 69, was wearing a green prison jumpsuit labeled on the back \u2018ALEXANDRIA INMATE\u2019 and no shoe on his right foot during the proceedings.\u201d POLITICOSCOOP -- \u201cU.S. to Tell Russia It Is Leaving Landmark I.N.F. Treaty,\u201d by NYT\u2019s David E. Sanger and William J. Broad: \u201cThe Trump administration is preparing to tell Russian leaders next week that it is planning to exit the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, in part to enable the United States to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, according to American officials and foreign diplomats. ... \u201cBut the pact has also constrained the United States from deploying new weapons to respond to China\u2019s efforts to cement a dominant position in the Western Pacific and to keep American naval forces at bay. ...\u201cThe White House said that no official decision had been made to leave the treaty, known as I.N.F., which at the time of its signing was considered a critical step in defusing Cold War tensions. But in the coming weeks, Mr. Trump is expected to sign off on the decision, which would mark the first time he has scrapped an arms control treaty, the American officials said.\u201d NYT\nPHOTO DU JOUR: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rep.

Four of those didn\u2019t list the accounts in their Senate questionnaires; two of the nominees are new and haven\u2019t given their materials to the committee yet.
