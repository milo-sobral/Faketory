He ordered troops to the border with Mexico to prevent a caravan of migrants from entering, yet that group is months away from reaching the U.S. And on Tuesday, he proposed ending birthright citizenship via executive order, which virtually all legal experts agree would be unconstitutional.Story Continued BelowA pattern has emerged: Trump's proposals are usually reported quickly \u2014 often credulously passed along in headlines and tweets \u2014 before thorough vetting later yields more skeptical reports.\u201cI think there is a pattern of at least the first reports on Trump statements being insufficiently skeptical,\u201d said Daniel Dale, a Toronto Star correspondent in Washington who has gained a large following on Twitter for his real-time fact-checking of Trump. He said reporters were too willing to assume a statement was true or a proposal realistic.\u201cI don\u2019t think I have all the coverage answers, but my mini-crusade has been trying to get people to not simply amplify Trump statements that are untrue without pointing out that they\u2019re untrue,\u201d Dale said. \u201cThree years into this, it\u2019s still not being done well enough, I don\u2019t think. It\u2019s just a core part of what we do. It\u2019s not a departure from basic journalism.\u201dYour guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Trump\u2019s rise to political prominence was built on his false claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. As president-elect, he claimed \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that millions of undocumented immigrants voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, claims some news organizations initially reported verbatim. And he's been doling out new proposals freely in the weeks leading up to next week's midterms, many of which critics say are impractical and geared mainly at ginning up his base. It's not clear how that approach will play with voters, who are expected to send more Democrats to Congress in 2019.The latest test for media outlets emerged Tuesday, when Axios published a video interview in which Trump declared he could single-handedly end birthright citizenship \u2014 the idea that most people born in the U.S. are automatically citizens, as provided by the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and falsely claimed that the United States \u201cis the only country in the world\u201d that has such a practice. More than 30 countries have similar policies.Almost immediately, the Associated Press blasted out Trump\u2019s false claim about other countries to more than 300,000 Twitter followers, only to later delete the tweet. Axios also initially failed to challenge Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 both during the interview itself and in print \u2014 although its piece was updated later Tuesday. The New York Times made similar updates to its own piece, and POLITICO also initially reported Trump's quote without push-back.But despite the mid-day course correction, Trump's comments were enough to get attention focused on the White House's preferred topics, tweeted Atlantic writer David Frum, a Trump critic.\u201cTrump's birthright citizenship vaporware is intended to prod cable TV into discussing something exciting to him, not boring stuff like pre-existing conditions and why would-be murderers are allowed to amass arsenals that could equip the police department of a small town,\u201d Frum tweeted. \u201cOr the worst month on world stock markets since 2009.\u201dKathleen Bartzen Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Trump understands how conflict, novelty and his own out-sized persona increase the news value of stories, and he exploits news outlets\u2019 race to report on him as soon as possible, despite the fact that he has racked up more than 5,000 falsehoods in office, according to a Washington Post tally.\u201cDonald Trump is particularly good at playing into some of the traditional practices of news and elevating coverage of himself,\u201d Culver said.\nElections\n                    By DAVID SIDERSThe key to resisting that tactic, according to journalists and media experts, is not ignoring what the president says but adding context, even if it means taking longer to publish a story.\u201cPresidents often make proposals that may not have much chance of ever becoming law, sometimes to shape a campaign and sometimes just to generate a national debate on an issue they care about,\u201d New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker said in an email. \u201cThat doesn't mean we shouldn't cover them. It means we should help readers understand the context in which the proposals are made and the circumstances that surround them.\u201dTim Franklin, a senior associate dean at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism, said that in the case of Trump\u2019s claim that he can end birthright citizenship with the swipe of a pen, that means journalists should be \u201ctalking to legal experts who can analyze whether this is really feasible or not\u201d before reporting what he said.Individual journalists on Twitter quickly pushed back against Trump\u2019s claims Tuesday. \u201cThis is false,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper tweeted in response to a Bloomberg Politics tweet repeating the claim that the U.S. was the only country to respect birthright citizenship. Tapper, who boasts nearly two million followers, wrote that \u201cat least 30 countries offer birthright citizenship, including almost every country in Central and South America.\u201dDale said he has seen some improvement, citing how news outlets deleted tweets or updated their stories.\u201cI think there has been growth,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s just been painfully slow.\u201d Missing out on the latest scoops?
