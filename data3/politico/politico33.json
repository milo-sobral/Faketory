CNN in New York was evacuated after an explosive device was sent to its office, addressed to former Obama-era CIA Director JOHN BRENNAN (who is actually an NBC/MSNBC contributor). This comes the day after a bomb was found at GEORGE SOROS\u2019 suburban New York home.-- HILLARY CLINTON, speaking in Florida today: \u201cWe are fine thanks to the men and women of the Secret Service who intercepted the package addressed to us long before it made its way to our home. \u2026 We have to do everything we can to bring our country together. We also have to elect candidates who will try to do the same. Who will set goals that will lift up every single Floridian and American.\u201dNYPD COMMISSIONER JAMES O\u2019NEILL said they found what they believe to be a pipe bomb and an envelope containing white powder at CNN.-- NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO called this \u201can act of terror.\u201d-- NEW YORK GOV. ANDREW CUOMO said at a news conference that \u201ca device\u201d was sent to his office in Manhattan, and he wouldn\u2019t at all be surprised if more devices are sent. CBS MIAMI reports this on Twitter (@CBSMiami): \u201c#BREAKING: Sunrise Police Department confirms an office building has been evacuated due to suspicious package in the mail. It\u2019s the same building where the office of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is located.\u201dCNN\u2019S ABBY PHILLIP (@abbydphillip): \u201cBREAKING via @PamelaBrownCNN and @joshscampbell: there was a suspicious package sent to Eric Holder with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019 return address. The package had the WRONG address and was sent back to DWS\u2019 office.\u201dABC\u2019S TARA PALMERI (@tarapalmeri): \u201cper @MLevineReports/@AaronKatersky: Sources confirm to ABC News that the public official whose name appeared in the return address of at least one of the packages is Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\u201d-- THE NEW NORMAL? In the last year alone: REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA.) was shot and nearly killed. A man was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill two senators. There was a deadly shooting at a Maryland newspaper. WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT \u2026 SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: \u201cWe condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures. These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards.\u201d-- @PressSec: \u201cThis is an ongoing situation that President Trump and his admin are monitoring closely. Our condemnation of these dispicable [sic] acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants. These cowardly acts are unacceptable and won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201dVP MIKE PENCE\u2019S STATEMENT: \u201cWe condemn the attempted attacks against former President Obama, the Clintons, CNN, and others. These cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this Country. Grateful for the swift response of Secret Service, the FBI & local law enforcement. Those responsible will be brought to justice.\u201d \u2026 @realDonaldTrump: \u201cI agree wholeheartedly!\u201dPOLITICO\u2019S STORY, which will be updated throughout the day -- \u201cPotential explosives sent to Clintons, Obamas, CNN,\u201d by Rebecca MorinSign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It would leave only one other major treaty in force that limits how many atomic weapons the U.S. and Russia can have at the ready \u2026 Now the odds of New START disappearing too are rising \u2026\u201c[Trump\u2019s] comments only fueled consternation over the fate of New START, which arms control specialists see as the biggest impediment to the type of atomic arms race that defined much of the Cold War.\u201d POLITICOWHAT\u2019S ON THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MIND -- @realDonaldTrump at 7:52 a.m.: \u201cFor those who want and advocate for illegal immigration, just take a good look at what has happened to Europe over the last 5 years. A total mess! They only wish they had that decision to make over again.\u201d\u2026 at 7:56 a.m.: \u201cWe are a great Sovereign Nation.

But there\u2019s still one way into America\u201d: \u201cThe era of mass migration by Mexican laborers streaming into California and the deserts of Arizona is over. \u2026 The migrants coming today are increasingly Central Americans seeking asylum or some form of humanitarian protection \u2026 They know the quickest path to a better life in the United States is now an administrative one \u2014 not through mountains or canyons but through the front gates of the country\u2019s immigration bureaucracy. \u2026 \u201cThe extraordinary surge of asylum seekers is testing the limits of whom, exactly, the United States is willing to protect, challenging the stone-carved ideal of America as the place that welcomes the tired and poor, \u2018yearning to breathe free.\u2019 It has also presented Trump with one of the most vexing policy challenges of his presidency, and virtually every measure taken so far has made the problem worse.\u201d WaPoTHE MIDTERMS \u2026 -- NYT\u2019S PATRICIA MAZZEI in Marathon, Fla.: \u201cIn a Florida Swing District, an \u2018Inconvenient\u2019 Republican Holds On,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Patricia Mazzei in Marathon, Fla.: \u201cA loss by [GOP Rep. Carlos] Curbelo could be a strong sign of a long-anticipated blue wave rolling across the biggest presidential swing state, and one more hurdle for Republicans hoping to keep control of the House. If he wins, it will most likely be seen not as a credit to the Republicans, but as a sign of the unique appeal of Mr. Curbelo himself. He is a Latino perhaps best known as an evangelist for climate science who, if he succeeds, might have identified a way for Republicans in Democratic-leaning districts to survive in the Trump era.\u201cThroughout his re-election campaign, Mr. Curbelo, a two-term incumbent who was also a top Democratic target in 2016, has remained unperturbed. \u2018Welcome to my world,\u2019 he tells other Republicans who find themselves in tight races this year. \u2018It\u2019s better this way. You stay in shape, politically.\u2019\u201d NYT -- NYT\u2019S ASTEAD HERNDON in Alpharetta, Ga.: \u201c\u2018Democrat. Fighter. Mother.\u2019 Lucy McBath Is Redefining Social Justice in Politics\u201d: \u201cMore than anyone else running for Congress, [Lucy] McBath, the Democratic nominee in a Republican-leaning race, is redefining social justice in politics this year, in large part through her deep personal connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. ...\u201cMany Democratic candidates across the country, after years of tiptoeing around issues of race out of fear of alienating white voters, are slowly adopting the language of anti-racist activists. It is an attempt to connect more closely with black voters, in particular, whose turnout will be key in several of November\u2019s most hotly contested midterm elections. Republicans have poured money into advertisements that lambaste Democrats on that move, casting their evolution as a sign of a corroding culture that\u2019s too politically correct.\u201d NYT -- NYT\u2019S CECILIA KANG: \u201cSnapchat Helps Register Over 400,000 Voters\u201d: \u201cMuch of the activity, the company said, was in key battleground states like Texas, Florida and Georgia. Snapchat, which is popular among teenagers and young adults, pushed people 18 and over to register by adding a button about doing so on each user\u2019s profile page. The company also sent video messages to all of those users urging them to register.

He said he wanted to \u2018send a message\u2019 to those working [to] pit the two against [one] another: that they would \u2018not be able to do that as long as there is a King called Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and a crown prince called Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and a president in Turkey called Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\u2019\u201d POLITICO -- AP\u2019S JON GAMBRELL (@jongambrellAP): \u201cNewsAlert: ANKARA, #Turkey (@AP) \u2014 Turkish officials: Erdogan discussed probe into journalist's killing with Saudi crown prince in telephone call.\u201d-- \u201cTranscript of President Trump\u2019s Interview With The Wall Street Journal\u201d: \u201cWSJ: Do you believe [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman]?

But not Shihabi, a Saudi national who may be the country\u2019s most effective defender in the U.S. capital. ... The Saudi ambassador left Washington earlier this month and reportedly may not return, but it matters less given that many already consider Shihabi, who is close to the Saudi leadership, to be the kingdom\u2019s unofficial envoy.\u201d POLITICO -- REUTERS/GENEVA: \u201cIran: Riyadh would not have murdered Khashoggi without U.S. protection\u201dVALLEY TALK -- \u201cApple\u2019s Tim Cook blasts Silicon Valley over privacy issues,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Tony Romm: \u201cApple chief executive Tim Cook on Wednesday warned the world\u2019s most powerful regulators that the poor privacy practices of some tech companies, the ills of social media and the erosion of trust in his own industry threaten to undermine \u2018technology\u2019s awesome potential\u2019 to address challenges like disease and climate change.\u201d WaPoTHE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026 \u201cGeorge Papadopoulos Hopes to Fuel Republicans\u2019 Suspicions About the Russia Probe,\u201d by The Atlantic\u2019s Natasha Bertrand: \u201cOn Thursday, [George] Papadopoulos will testify to what he believes was an operation designed by the FBI, in coordination with Britain\u2019s intelligence services, to \u2018infiltrate\u2019 and \u2018sabotage\u2019 the Trump campaign.
