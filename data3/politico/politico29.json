Or else. How many kids do you have\u2026 7? Unlucky 7. What is what we think of you. Time to get out of politics.\u201dStory Continued BelowThe letter and a ripped up \u201cWebber for Congress\u201d campaign sign were sent to the candidate\u2019s place of business, his campaign said. Law enforcement officials are investigating.\u201cCriticizing a candidate on the issues is part of politics. Threatening my children is not,\u201d Webber tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cWe are thankful for the support of law enforcement as we work to find whoever is behind this gutless act. We will not be intimidated as we work to make #NJ11 better for everyone.\u201dNews of the threat comes as authorities are investigating potential explosives sent to CNN and Democratic figures including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire donor George Soros.Webber, a five-term state assemblyman from North Jersey, is running in the state\u2019s 11th District in what has become one of the most competitive races in the country. The voting demographics in the district have shifted so much that longtime Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, a Republican who has represented the district for nearly a quarter-century, chose to retire rather than face his first competitive general election.Webber is running against Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and former federal prosecutor. Sherrill condemned the threats against Webber.\u201cThis is absolutely appalling,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNo one who decides to run for public office should feel that, by doing so, they are putting their family in danger. I condemn this in the strongest terms and hope law enforcement determines who was behind this and holds them accountable.\u201dMatt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the dayOur morning email about New Jersey health care policy and politicsA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.POLITICO New Jersey Pro's high-level outlook on the policy issues driving the month in New Jersey.Matt Friedman's must-read briefing on the Garden State's important news of the day\n                        POLITICO ProA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on New Jersey politics and policy.\n                        POLITICO ProOur morning email about New Jersey health care policy and politics\n                        POLITICO PROPOLITICO New Jersey Pro\u2019s high-level outlook on the policy issues driving the month in New Jersey.\n                        POLITICO ProOriginal federal and state policy documents \u00a9 2018 POLITICO LLC"}
