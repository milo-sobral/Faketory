Rick Scott when he issued an emergency order to expand voting opportunities there after the storm. Despite the prohibition, Bay County Election Supervisor Mark Andersen says he stands by his decision in the Republican-rich county after Hurricane Michael. In all, he said, 147 voters returned ballots through email but only 10 were purely email-to-email interactions. In the other cases, voters used fax machines to email their ballots in, which is currently permitted by state law for overseas voters.Story Continued Below\u201cWhoever has a problem with this should be ashamed,\u201d Andersen told POLITICO. \u201cThis area was hit by a hurricane and some people still don\u2019t have power, some still don\u2019t have water and one of my staff doesn\u2019t have a home. Other staff need to fix their roofs.Neither the state\u2019s elections division or Scott\u2019s office immediately responded to requests for comment about the story, which was first reported by WJHG/WECP in Panama City.The voters who cast ballots through email signed an oath, verified identification and secured the information, according to WJHG/WECP.A similar policy is used for overseas voters, Andersen told the outlets. Democrats accuse Scott \u2014 who has raised the specter of \u201cwidespread fraud\u201d in Democrat-heavy South Florida counties without providing clear evidence \u2014 of hypocrisy by saying nothing of the apparently illegal email voting that he specifically said shouldn\u2019t take place. \u201cWhy does this supervisor in this county not have to follow the law?\u201d asked state Sen. Kevin Rader (D-Delray Beach), whose district includes parts of Palm Beach and Broward counties where Scott has sued the elections supervisors amid the recount in his U.S. Senate race. \u201cEmail ballots aren\u2019t legal,\u201d Rader said. \u201cWhy the double standard?\"But Andersen said this was an extreme case. He said his office still verified voter signatures to make sure lawful votes were cast.\u201cWe sent out ballots to get people to vote. If you cancel these votes, you cancel Democratic and Republican votes,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cElections are for voters. They\u2019re not for the candidates.\u201dThe Florida Department of State has received reports of Bay County\u2019s fax and email votes, spokesperson Sarah Revell said by email. Outside of that acknowledgment, the state offered no further information Monday.\u201cSupervisors of Elections are independently elected constitutional officers and it is each Supervisors\u2019 responsibility to adhere to the law at all times,\u201d Revell wrote.Scott on Oct. 18 issued an emergency executive order to help ensure voters in the counties hit hardest by Michael would have opportunities to vote. The order allowed counties to open mega-precincts for all voters in eight counties: Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Jackson, Liberty and Washington.In a statement on Oct. 18, Scott explicitly said voting through fax or email would not be allowed.\u201cIn the hardest hit areas, communication via phone, fax and email remains challenging and would be an unreliable method for returning ballots,\u201d a written statement from Scott\u2019s office said. \u201cAdditionally, past attempts by other states to allow voters impacted by natural disasters to fax or email ballots have been rife with issues. The Department is actively reviewing ways to provide more absentee ballots to those voters in the counties severely impacted by Hurricane Michael.\u201dIn Bay County, Scott received 73.1 percent of the vote \u2014 46,646 votes \u2014 compared to Nelson\u2019s 26.1 percent, or 16,684 votes, according to unofficial election results.Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis was ahead by a similar margin: 71.6 percent, or 45,694 votes, against Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s 26.2 percent, or 16,738 votes.A weekly, must-read brief on health care news and moves in Tallahassee and around the stateA morning email with must-read analysis and breaking news on Florida politics and policy.A weekly must-read on budget politics for Florida Pros, with exclusive reporting and analysis, interviews and more.
