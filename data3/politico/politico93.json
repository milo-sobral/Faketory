We are flying high and taking pride in the greatest Democratic victory in the House since 1974. \u2026 \u201cWe have great opportunity, and therefore great responsibility to get results for the American people. In the next few weeks, we need to be unified, find common ground with Republicans in our legislative engagements, but stand our ground when we must.\u201d The full letter NYT\u2019S SHERYL GAY STOLBERG -- \u201cMeet the New House Democrats: They Could Be a Management Headache\u201d: \u201cWhen these and other newly elected House Democrats arrive in Washington for their orientation this week, they will reflect the most diverse, most female freshman class in history \u2014 a group of political neophytes, savvy veterans of the Obama and Clinton administrations, as well as the first Muslim women and Native American women ever elected to Congress.\u201cThe class is ideologically diverse as well, spanning the philosophical spectrum from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York, to Joe Cunningham, a South Carolina lawyer who won a stunning upset victory in the Charleston suburbs, on the strength of his promises to put \u2018country over party\u2019 and work with President Trump.\u201d NYT SPOTTED: John Kerry walking around Paris alone. COLUMBUS DISPATCH\u2019S JESSICA WEHRMAN: \u201cSherrod Brown for president? He\u2019s thinking about it\u201d: \u201c\u2018My first mission is to encourage people to start talking about (American workers) more, reaching out to people in the industrial Midwest,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ll see later on about the presidential race. But we are thinking about it for the first time seriously.\u2019\u201cBrown ... said regardless of whether he runs, he wants Democrats who are seeking the White House to use lessons from his race as a blueprint for how to run in the industrial Midwest.\u201d Columbus Dispatch PREPPING THE ATTACK \u2026 THE PRESIDENT, at 10:34 a.m.: \u201cThe prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\u201d-- MOST ECONOMISTS believe the economy will slow down, but Trump has a useful foil: House Democrats. Also, \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d is clearly in the talking points. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY.) used it last week in the Capitol.REALLY, WALL STREET JOURNAL OPINION SECTION? REP. JASON LEWIS, a Minnesota Republican who lost last week, writes this: \u201cWho Lost The House? John McCain: His July 2017 vote killed ObamaCare repeal and made Democratic lies impossible to refute.\u201d-- THIS IS TASTELESS, for starters. And it also doesn\u2019t make any sense. Lewis writes that McCain\u2019s decision to vote against the health care bill \u201cprompted a \u2018green wave\u2019 of liberal special-interest money, which was used to propagate false claims that the House plan \u2018gutted coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\u2019\u201d How did the Republicans\u2019 inability to repeal Obamacare spark a flood of Democratic donations?Good Monday afternoon.A message from Delta Air Lines:Connecting armed service members with their loved ones while they undergo treatment and recovery is a small way to say thank you to the men and women who bravely serve us.

Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasn\u2019t, on both Military and Trade. We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection,........\u201d\u2026 at 7:10 a.m.: \u201c.....hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue -- It is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the United States. Massive amounts.....\u201d\u2026 at 7:21 a.m.: \u201c.....of money spent on protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses. It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR!\u201d\u2026 at 7:44 a.m.: \u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected.

Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters. ...\u201cThis recount process is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren\u2019t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\u201d AP -- \u201cWill a recount change anything in the Florida statewide races?\u201d by Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Kirby Wilson: \u201cAccording to an analysis by the nonpartisan group FairVote, which advocates for electoral reforms that make it easier to vote, out of 4,687 statewide general elections between 2000 and 2016, just 26 went to a recount. \u201cOf those 26, just three recounts wound up changing the initial result of the race: The 2004 Washington governor\u2019s race, the 2006 Vermont state auditor's race and the 2008 Minnesota U.S. Senate race. The average swing in those three elections after the recounts? About 311 votes. \u2026 Essentially, Nelson \u2014 and to a greater extent, Gillum \u2014 would need a systematic error to be discovered during their recounts if their results are to be reversed.\u201d Tampa Bay Times 2018 WATCH -- AP\u2019S DAVID SHARP: \u201cNew way of voting faces test in Maine congressional district\u201d: \u201cThe four-way political battle won\u2019t conclude until a computer algorithm has the final say this week on whether Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin wins re-election or is ousted by Democratic state lawmaker Jared Golden. \u2026\u201cUnder the system, a candidate wins with a majority of first-place votes. If there\u2019s no majority, the last-place candidate\u2019s second-place votes are reallocated to remaining candidates. The computerized process can be repeated until there\u2019s a winner. Across the country, voting reform advocates are watching as the system faces its biggest test in the most expensive race in Maine history.\u201d AP 2020 WATCH -- NEW YORKER\u2019S JEFFREY TOOBIN: \u201cDeval Patrick\u2019s Presidential Prospects: Can an Obama acolyte be elected after Trump?\u201d: \u201cPatrick has no illusions about the difficulty he will have distinguishing himself from the crowd. As governor from 2007 to 2015, he was little known outside New England, and he hasn\u2019t spoken much in public since. \u2026\u201cEven within his own state, he is one of five potential candidates, along with Warren, John Kerry, and Representatives Joe Kennedy III and Seth Moulton. Still, Patrick would enter the race with one significant distinction: he is a kind of political heir to Barack Obama, and enjoys broad support from people close to the former President.\u201d The New Yorker AT THE BORDER \u2026 \u201cThey Were Stopped at the Texas Border. Their Nightmare Had Only Just Begun,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Manny Fernandez in McAllen, Texas: \u201cThe Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, with nearly twice the staff of the F.B.I. Through the years, a small number of officers have succumbed to temptation and reached for a share of the millions of dollars generated in the smuggling of drugs, weapons and people across the southwest border. \u201cBut a civil suit stemming from [a] March 2014 attack near McAllen, now making its way through the courts, is shedding light on a more sinister kind of corruption. Over the past four years, at least 10 people in South Texas have been victims of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping or rape \u2014 all, according to prosecutors and officials, at the hands of Border Patrol agents who suddenly and violently snapped.\u201d NYT TRADE WARS -- \u201cU.S. Adopts New Battle Plan to Fight China\u2019s Theft of Trade Secrets,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Kate O\u2019Keeffe: \u201cThe Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property, according to people familiar with the matter. \u2026\u201cThe new approach could help the Trump administration win friends in the business community, which has criticized the president\u2019s tariff policy as broad and ineffective when it comes to protecting trade secrets, whose theft costs the country hundreds of billions of dollars a year, according to some U.S. government estimates.\u201d WSJ AFTERNOON READ \u2026 VANITY FAIR\u2019S MARIE BRENNER: \u201cI See Him As a Modern-day Pablo Escobar\u201d: Inside Bill Browder\u2019s War Against Putin: In a series of revealing new interviews, Putin\u2019s public enemy No. 1 offers scintillating details about his investigation into Russian financial malfeasance, running for his life, and the Helsinki fallout.\u201d VF TRANSITION -- Christina Pearson has departed Microsoft\u2019s D.C. office after nine years where she was senior director of public affairs.
