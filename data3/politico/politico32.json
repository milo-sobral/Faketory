Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing,\u201d Underwood said in a statement. \u201cInstead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.\u201dThe fraud alleged in Wednesday\u2019s suit reached the highest levels of Exxon management, including former Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson, Underwood said in a tweet.The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Company spokesman Scott Silvestri also criticized the case as the \"product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general\u2019s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.\"The basis for the lawsuit rests on the idea of \u201cstranded assets,\u201d and whether companies will be forced to leave oil, natural gas and coal in the ground because of tightening regulations around greenhouse gases. That notion has gained currency in some investing circles, and some analysts have grown concerned about whether fossil fuel companies will remain viable in the coming years given the potential for carbon-constraining climate policies.The lawsuit alleges Exxon told investors it uses a \u201cproxy cost\u201d to price carbon pollution and to assess the effect of carbon regulation on its business, but that the company actually \u201capplied much lower proxy costs or no proxy cost at all,\u201d Underwood\u2019s office said in a statement.The AG's investigation grew out of reporting by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times showing Exxon had known for decades that fossil fuels would drive global climate, even as it spent millions on lobbying efforts to downplay and distort public perception of fossil fuels\u2019 effect on warming the planet.Exxon has said it does not dispute climate change. The company also supported the Paris climate accord and recently pledged $1 million to Americans for Carbon Dividends, a group that supports taxing carbon emissions and returning revenues to people in exchange for barring climate liability lawsuits.Missing out on the latest scoops?
