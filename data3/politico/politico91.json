The issue revolves around whether Pelosi will need 218 Democratic votes \u2014 or just a simple majority of Democrats, as the current caucus rule states \u2014 to be the party's speaker nominee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Story Continued BelowAnti-Pelosi forces led by Reps. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) have asked to change Democratic Caucus rules to require the party's nominee for speaker \u2014 which will almost certainly be Pelosi in this case \u2014 to get 218 Democratic votes in order to move forward. While Pelosi is not named in the motion, it is clearly aimed at her.Pelosi's allies are opposed to the rules change, arguing that it would \"empower a small minority of Members to override how we use our Caucus to select Democratic leaders in the House,\" they said in a letter to other House Democrats on Thursday. The group includes: Jamie Raskin (Md.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Dwight Evans (Pa.), Val Demings (Fla.), Ted Deutch (Fla.), John Garamendi (Calif.), Betty McCollum (Minn.), Louise Frankel (Fla.), Don Beyer (Va.), Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), Andre Carson (Ind.), Lloyd Doggett (Texas), and Doris Matsui (Calif.).A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Democratic leadership elections are Nov. 28, and Pelosi is heavily favored to be the party's choice for speaker.Missing out on the latest scoops?
