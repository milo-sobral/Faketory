Each day, a reluctant President Donald Trump is forced to respond to a new revelation. The affair has betrayed a yet unseen presidential aptitude for restraint.Story Continued BelowMeanwhile, the Saudis\u2019 initially combative tone has been quietly replaced with a more deferential stance. They have opened the valves on their idled oil production, exactly as Trump has demanded in his tweets. Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih has talked down oil prices with unusually forthright public statements, saying the kingdom will make sure global demand is met, no matter what.For Trump and his embattled Republican allies in the U.S. midterm elections, the change in Saudi behavior is welcome. And as long as Trump soft-pedals the Khashoggi affair, it seems the Saudis are willing to cooperate with the American president\u2019s oil market wishes.A few weeks ago, there were rumors that Trump was pondering an election-timed release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now, with the Saudis on board, U.S. gasoline prices\u2014the third rail of domestic politics\u2014should remain low at election time.If Trump\u2019s measured responses are incentivizing Saudi production increases, the president\u2019s policies are working. The international oil price is down about $9, from $85 just after Khashoggi\u2019s murder to $76 on Tuesday.Prior to the Khashoggi murder, Saudi Arabia had been slow-walking promised production increases despite strong evidence that Trump\u2019s sanctions on Iran were strangling oil markets. Saudi oil output rose by just 300,000 barrels per day between June and October, while Iran\u2019s oil exports fell by about triple that amount, around 1 million barrels per day.Had the Saudis continued to drag their feet, prices might have neared the iconic $100 mark just in time for the U.S. election\u2014handing Democrats a convenient talking point. Trump\u2019s unilateral removal from world markets of 1.5 million barrels per day of Iranian oil would have looked masochistic, given that his sanctions deadline is just two days ahead of the Nov. 6 elections.But global outrage over the Saudi critic\u2019s murder has put the kingdom on the back foot. Allies and detractors alike, including normally friendly Republicans in the U.S. Senate, are baying for sanctions and an arms embargo.While Saudi political leaders produced fumbling explanations for the murder, the oil minister stepped forward to change the narrative. Al-Falih promised another 300,000 barrel-per-day increase \u201csoon\u201d and said the kingdom still had another 1 million barrels of spare capacity it could call upon. If that weren\u2019t enough, Saudi Arabia would consider investing in further capacity increases, he said. \u201cWe will meet any demand that materializes,\u201d Al-Falih said Tuesday. The comments calmed skittish markets, revealing that the oil minister, at least, is one Saudi official who retains credibility.Is the kingdom rewarding Trump\u2019s softly-softly approach? It\u2019s hard to be sure. But the timing makes it look like the Saudis are banking that the president needs low gasoline prices more than he needs Riyadh in the penalty box.The wild card is Erdogan. What depredations will emerge in the Turkish president\u2019s next release? Will he finally release the alleged recordings of the gory murder and dismemberment in Istanbul?Should that happen, Trump\u2019s resolve could crumble. A forceful presidential response could revive Saudi threats to take \u201cbigger measures\u201d (read: oil) if the kingdom\u2019s leadership were censured.Although Al-Falih has stated that the kingdom has no intention of revisiting the the hardball tactics that brought us the Arab oil embargo of 1973, other Saudi policymakers have broached the possibility.\u201cIf President Trump was angered by $80 oil, nobody should rule out the price jumping to $100 and $200 a barrel or maybe double that figure,\u201d wrote Turki al-Dakhil, an ally of the Saudi royal court and director of the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news network.These were undoubtedly scare tactics. But coming from Saudi Arabia, scare tactics can put a scare into oil markets. Prices get notoriously jumpy when Saudi Arabia sheds predictability.And if prices get jumpy, Trump\u2019s Iran embargo would quickly be undermined by a sheaf of sanctions waivers, starting with Turkey and India, and then extending to others.Pretty soon, the embargo starts to look like Obama\u2019s, where import waivers were handed out because OPEC didn\u2019t have the spare capacity to cover the loss of Iran\u2019s exports.Trump has a weak hand. He knows that the Saudis\u2019 influence over U.S. gasoline prices gives them leverage in U.S. elections. Until the voting is done, bet on this: The president will find it hard to get tough on his Saudi friends.Jim Krane (@jimkrane) is a fellow for energy and geopolitics at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Bill Arnold (LinkedIn) is a professor in the practice of energy management at Rice\u2019s Jones Graduate School of Business.Swamp Diary \n\n                        By Jack Shafer\nThe Friday Cover\n\n                        By Keith Kloor\nPolitics\n\n                        By Derek Robertson\n\n \u00a9 2018 POLITICO LLC"}
