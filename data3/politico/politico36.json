The retiring Utah Republican, who leads the Senate panel that writes tax laws, expressed unfamiliarity with Trump\u2019s proposal this week of a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class. Hatch said he could not comment on any new tax cut proposal and said he has not seen details regarding what the president has been referring to this week.Story Continued BelowThe president said Congress will likely take up a tax cut \u201cresolution\u201d after the election, though he offered scant details on the proposal in a Tuesday interview with the Wall Street Journal.\u201cIt would take a real monumental effort to get it through, but it\u2019s always taken a monumental effort. So, a lot depends on the political climate and as you know I\u2019ve seen miracles happen before,\u201d Hatch told reporters on Wednesday after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing held during the congressional recess. \u201cYou can\u2019t count out the Congress.\u201dHatch said he has not discussed a tax cut vote with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell\u2019s office said it had no scheduling announcements to make.In September, the House passed a bill making permanent the temporary tax cuts for individuals included in last year\u2019s tax reform law. The Senate has declined to take it up because it cannot garner 60 votes and some Democrats in difficult campaigns would likely have voted for it to blunt criticism for opposing last year\u2019s tax reform law. The GOP has declined to use budget reconciliation so far this year, the method used to pass last year's tax cuts with a simple majority in the Senate.

House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said this week that if the GOP keeps the House and Senate he would work with the administration to offer the middle class tax relief.Hatch did not offer a similar commitment, but said there very well could be a proposal before Congress in this year\u2019s lame duck session.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get into more details before I comment about it. But it will come right to me so I\u2019ll be doing my best not to mess it up,\u201d Hatch said. Trump will \u201csay the way he wants to do them and he\u2019s been pretty successful so far. So I\u2019m going to be the last to criticize him.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
