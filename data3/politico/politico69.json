Tomorrow, the president will hold rallies in: Cleveland, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Cape Girardeau, Mo. -- TODAY \u2026 TRUMP will be in Macon, Ga., for a 3:55 p.m. rally. He then will fly to Chattanooga, Tenn., for a 7:05 p.m. rally. VP MIKE PENCE will be with him in Tennessee. CONSISTENCY: The Washington Post/ABC and Wall Street Journal/NBC polls are showing generally the same thing: voters prefer Democrats by seven or so points. Top Republicans have been telling us all year that the generic needs to be at D+4 to D+6 for Republicans to have a chance. WAPO\u2019S DAN BALZ and SCOTT CLEMENT lay it out on A1: \u201cDemocrats lead in House preferences, but positive views of the economy and concern about border security may buoy Republicans, poll finds\u201d: \u201cDemocrats retain their advantage in the battle for the House, but Republicans could be buoyed by increasingly positive assessments of the economy and by President Trump\u2019s harsh focus on the issues of immigration and border security, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News national poll.\u201cThe poll finds that registered voters prefer Democratic candidates for the House over Republican candidates by 50 percent to 43 percent. That marks a slight decline from last month, when Democrats led on the generic congressional ballot by 11 points, and a bigger drop from August, when they enjoyed a 14-point advantage.\u201cDemocrats also have a 51-to- 44 percent advantage among likely voters identified by The Post. That seven-point margin, which is in line with other polls taken in the past two weeks, puts Democrats roughly within range of what they probably will need in the overall national vote for the House to capture a majority from the Republicans, based on calculations from previous midterm campaigns.\u201d WaPo-- WSJ poll story, by Janet Hook.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

They\u2019re packing coolers and tents, oiling rifles and tuning up aerial drones, with plans to form caravans of their own and trail American troops to the border.\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll observe and report, and offer aid in any way we can,\u2019 said Shannon McGauley, a bail bondsman in the Dallas suburbs who is president of the Texas Minutemen.

That's in contrast to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who leads the 4th District by 9 percentage points in her race against Democrat Fred Hubbell.\u201d DSM-- CHICAGO TRIBUNE, on the blueing suburbs and exurbs: \u201cThe 6th Congressional District seat [Henry] Hyde held until making way for Peter Roskam in 2007 is one of the top targeted seats for a Democratic takeover through challenger Sean Casten of Downers Grove.\u201cMuch of Hyde\u2019s old congressional territory in eastern DuPage is now represented by Democrats \u2014 U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley of Chicago and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg \u2014 and former Republican Congressman Harris Fawell, who represented what is now Roskam\u2019s 6th District, has a Casten sign in his front yard in Glen Ellyn.\u201cAdditionally, an exurban congressional seat that includes portions of DuPage, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Hultgren of Plano, is under intense competition from Democratic challenger Lauren Underwood of Naperville.\u201d Chicago Tribune \u2026 The Guardian's Ben Jacobs on Roskam-- L.A. TIMES: \u201cDecline of white Republicans on L.A.\u2019s northern outskirts puts GOP at risk in midterm election,\u201d by Michael Finnegan: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s sorely diminished Republican Party has few footholds left in Los Angeles County, and it risks losing its biggest one in the midterm election on Tuesday: the House seat of Rep. Steve Knight of Palmdale.\u201cRapidly expanding racial and ethnic diversity on the northern edge of L.A.\u2019s suburban sprawl has opened a path for Knight\u2019s Democratic rival, Katie Hill, to seize this once-solid Republican turf.\u201cThe state\u2019s 25th Congressional District \u2014 it covers the Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita and Simi Valley \u2014 is a lot less white and less Republican than it used to be. The white share of the population has dropped to 40%.\u201cAs the campaign draws to a close, President Trump\u2019s stop-the-caravan, troops-to-the-border crusade could further imperil Knight and other Republicans on the ballot in L.A. and Orange counties. For more than two decades, the party\u2019s belligerence on immigration has proved toxic in California.\u201d LAT-- MATT DIXON in Tallahassee: \u201cAt DeSantis rally, Perdue says Florida governor\u2019s race \u2018so cotton-pickin\u2019 important\u2019\u201d: \u201cDuring a Saturday rally for Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, President Donald Trump\u2019s top agriculture official used the term \u2018cotton-pickin\u2019 to describe the importance of Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race, which also features Democrat Andrew Gillum, who is running to be Florida's first black governor. \u201c\u2018Public policy matters. Leadership matters,\u2019 said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at a Lakeland rally, according to audio provided by American Bridge. \u2018And that is why this election is so cotton-pickin\u2019 important to the state of Florida. I hope you all don\u2019t mess it up.\u2019\u201d POLITICO \u2026 AudioDONALD TRUMP JR. says NANCY PELOSI is \u201cTIRED OLD\u201d in a radio ad for HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIRMAN MARK MEADOWS (R-N.C.): \u201cThis is Donald Trump Jr. and I need to tell you something of the utmost importance to my dad, our president, and how we can continue making America great again. We need you to vote for my good friend, Congressman Mark Meadows, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. \u201cMARK IS ONE OF MY DAD\u2019S closest allies in Congress. Without Mark Meadows, the MAGA agenda would not be working. If you don\u2019t vote, the Democrats will take control of Congress and tired old Nancy Pelosi will take the gavel in the House of Representatives, where she\u2019ll try to impeach my father and Justice Kavanaugh and enact her radical socialist agenda of government-run healthcare, high taxes and gun bans. \u201cAND THAT\u2019S ALL BEFORE JANUARY 15TH. Once again, this is Donald Trump Jr. and we need you to vote for my dad\u2019s number one ally, Congressman Mark Meadows, or every part of the MAGA agenda and my father\u2019s presidency is in serious jeopardy.\u201d Listen to the ad-- PELOSI has been in 30 cities in 31 days in October, so she doesn\u2019t appear tired. And she has said she would not move to impeach Trump and Kavanaugh. But this does appear to be a useful preview of how Republicans are going to talk about Pelosi if she becomes the speaker of the House.-- JAMES ARKIN: \u201cDon Jr. to attend 6 rallies in 1 day for House Republicans\u201dSUNDAY BEST \u2026 -- CHRIS WALLACE spoke with DSCC CHAIRMAN CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (Md.) on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d: CVH: \u201cThis is the toughest political map any one party has faced in 60 years. And if you were to have asked people a year and a half ago where we would be, you would not even be asking the question about whether or not we have a path to a Senate Democratic majority. The answer is: we do have a path, it is a very narrow path, as you indicate, but the fact that we\u2019re as competitive as we are is a real testament to our senators and our candidates who have always said that their North Star is standing up for the people of their states, that\u2019s their first and foremost priority, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing.\u201d-- CHUCK TODD spoke with STACEY ABRAMS on NBC\u2019S \u201cMEET THE PRESS\u201d: TODD: \u201cThe president\u2019s going to be in Macon, Georgia today. He said you just simply weren\u2019t qualified to be governor. He didn\u2019t say why. How did you take that assessment?\u201dABRAMS: \u201cI find his assessments to be vapid and shallow. I am the most qualified candidate. I am a business owner. I\u2019m a tax attorney, who was trained at Yale Law School. I am a civic leader who helped register more than 200,000 Georgians. I am a very accomplished political leader who worked across the aisle to improve access to education, transportation, and I blocked the single largest tax increase in Georgia\u2019s history. There is no one more qualified standing for this office in Georgia. And I look forward to having the voters of Georgia say the same.\u201d -- NOTE: Josh Hawley dropped out of his scheduled appearance on MTP, according to an NBC spokesman.-- GOTTA BE A JOKE, RIGHT? \u2026 RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL to GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS on ABC\u2019S \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: \u201cThe president\u2019s talking about all of the accomplishments.

You don\u2019t have any issue with that?\u201d MCDANIEL: \u201cIt\u2019s -- I have an issue with our immigration system that\u2019s not being fixed, and Democrats won\u2019t work with the president.

The work is lucrative \u2014 the three firms have earned hundreds of millions of dollars altogether on projects in Saudi Arabia. McKinsey\u2019s work in the kingdom grew from two Saudi projects in 2010 to almost 50 the following year and kept accelerating, to almost 600 projects from 2011 to 2016.\u201cMcKinsey consultants spread across the kingdom in recent years to advise government agencies such as the planning ministry, nicknamed the \u2018Ministry of McKinsey\u2019 by some Saudis; the royal court; and a coterie of companies in industries such as banking, media, telecommunications, real estate and energy, internal McKinsey documents viewed by The New York Times showed. Last year, McKinsey bought a politically connected Saudi consultancy, adding that firm\u2019s 140 employees to more than 300 already in the region.\u201d NYTTAKE THE PLAYBOOK ELECTION CHALLENGE -- See if you can correctly pick the winning candidates in some of the most competitive House, Senate and gubernatorial races in the country.

It was an easy choice for him, one that was months in the making, rooted in decisions he\u2019d made years ago to serve God, his family and his country.\u201c\u2018While I am far from perfect in any of these respects,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have given my life to serve all three of these loyalties whenever and however I can.\u2019 The plan was to be gone one year. Family learned Saturday he\u2019d never return. Taylor was killed during an apparent insider attack early Saturday in Kabul. The attacker was immediately killed by Afghan Forces, according to NATO.\u201d Salt Lake TribuneDEEP DIVE -- \u201cHow the Trump Administration Fought to Ask About Citizenship on the Census,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Michael Wines: \u201cPressed on whether partisan politics colored consideration of the question, [Commerce Secretary Wilbur] Ross said in sworn testimony to Congress in March that he was responding \u2018solely\u2019 to a Justice Department request for data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He also said he knew of no talks with the White House about the matter. But that story has since unraveled. Internal government documents produced in the principal lawsuit on the issue, in New York, show Mr. Ross pressured the Justice Department to request the citizenship question, not the other way around.\u201cThey also show the involvement of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist at the time, Stephen K. Bannon, in the discussions. After Mr. Bannon requested that Mr. Ross \u2018talk to someone about the census,\u2019 Mr. Ross met with Kris Kobach, a fierce immigration opponent whom President Trump had appointed to a panel on voter fraud.\u201d NYTBONUS GREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman:-- \u201cThe Big Meltdown,\u201d by Craig Welch in NatGeo: \u201cAs the Antarctic Peninsula heats up, the rules of life there are being ripped apart.
