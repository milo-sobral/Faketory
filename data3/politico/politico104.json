Just more FAKE NEWS, the Enemy of the People!\u201dIn a story published Friday, the Times reported that Trump has recently been querying White House aides and advisers as to whether they considered Pence loyal ahead of the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\nWhite House\n                    By QUINT FORGEYEarlier Saturday, speaking to reporters at the White House before departing for California to survey damage from the state\u2019s wildfires, Trump dismissed the Times\u2019 report.Trump, who is known to hold personal loyalty as a deciding factor in many of his friendships and hiring decisions, referred to the vice president as \u201ca trooper\u201d and \u201ca terrific person\u201d who has \u201calready been tested, in many ways.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t question his loyalty at all,\u201d the president said of Pence, according to a pool report. \u201cHe is 100 percent loyal. It was a phony story.\u201dTrump also suggested that neither he nor White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were contacted for comment on the Times\u2019 story.\u201cHow do you do a story like that, and you don\u2019t call the principal?\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would give them a quote, I would say it\u2019s not true. And that\u2019s the end of their story. But they don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nMedia \n                    By JASON SCHWARTZThe president added: \u201cYou know what the quote would be? Mike Pence is 100 percent. Now you can't do your story. So that\u2019s why they don\u2019t like calling me for a quote.\u201dMaggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for the Times and a co-author of the story (who is also a former POLITICO reporter), disputed the president\u2019s account in a tweet Saturday. Haberman said she corresponded with Sanders via email ahead of the story\u2019s publication, and pointed to a quote from White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley that is featured in the story.\u201cFACT CHECK: Emailed with @PressSec and spoke with first deputy Hogan Gidley, who is quoted,\u201d Haberman wrote online. \u201cPOTUS would need to talk to them about why they didn\u2019t provide us with a quote from him.\u201dPence was in Singapore on Thursday for the multinational East Asia Summit, where he and National Security Adviser John Bolton talked briefly with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. On Saturday, Pence represented the U.S. at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Papua New Guinea.Asked by reporters Saturday about the veracity of the report, Pence said he and the president enjoyed \u201ca very close\u201d and \u201ca very strong\u201d relationship, according to a pool report. The vice president also revealed that the story was mentioned in a recent conversation he shared with the president.\u201cIt came up,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe had a good laugh.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
