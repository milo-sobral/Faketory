Yet that lengthy time frame, combined with the midterm election and possible reshuffling of congressional control, raises significant questions about when and whether lawmakers will be able to leverage their power to push back if the administration doesn\u2019t act. Story Continued BelowSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said in an interview this week that he believes the administration is taking the sanctions-triggering investigation he requested \u201cseriously.\u201d \u201cIf there is any sense that is not being taken seriously,\u201d Corker added, lawmakers \u201cmay well need\u201d to consider their own \u201csurgical piece of legislation\u201d imposing sanctions.Corker is one of several GOP lawmakers decrying Khashoggi\u2019s assassination and pointing to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as  likely being involved in the dissident journalist's disappearance. On Friday night, the Saudi government confirmed for the first time that Khashoggi was killed, saying it was a \u201cfist fight\u201d gone bad.

However, Trump also avoided criticizing the Saudi regime\u2019s alleged role in the Khashoggi case and reaffirmed his disinterest in any cutoff of U.S.-Saudi arms sales as a possible punishment. The president has distanced himself from reported intelligence that points to the crown prince\u2019s knowledge of the alleged attack on the journalist, who vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.If the administration delays imposing sanctions or slow-walks its response, it remains to be seen whether Corker would have time to pursue any narrow legislation on the issue before leaving Congress later this year. His likely successor on the Foreign Relations panel next year, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), joined last week\u2019s bipartisan push for the administration to investigate Khashoggi\u2019s death and decide within 120 days on sanctions for any individuals found responsible. Still, it\u2019s not clear that Risch would push to hold Saudi Arabia accountable as strongly as Corker, who also warned of a \u201cclampdown\u201d in intelligence sharing on Khashoggi.  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of Congress\u2019 most vocal critics of the Saudi government\u2019s human rights record, said in an interview: \u201cI trust that Sen. Corker\u2019s really serious about this, and I don\u2019t know that will be the case if he\u2019s not chairman.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to be into shutdown crises after the election, given the way the president is talking about the border wall. So I do worry that some other crisis and some new dominant news cycle will take over very shortly,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI think the Saudis and the Trump administration seem to be playing from the same book, which is to try to ride this out and wait until some other story grabs reporters\u2019 attention.\u201dMurphy and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) are poised to force a vote on blocking a U.S.-Saudi arms deal when the next one comes before Congress. It\u2019s the sort of showdown they came close to winning last year amid bipartisan frustration over Riyadh\u2019s role in the violent war in Yemeni. But a looming hold on those arms deals from New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the Foreign Relations panel\u2019s top Democrat, casts doubt on when lawmakers will have their next opportunity to weigh in on Trump's $110 billion in Saudi weapons sales.\nForeign Policy\n                    By MARTIN MATISHAKTrump said Friday, during an appearance alongside several House Republicans, that it \u201cwould be very hurtful to this country if we said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re not going to sell\u2019\u201d promised goods to Saudi Arabia. \u201cSo, there are other things we can do.\u201dTrump\u2019s administration has previously used the human rights law that Congress is invoking in the Khashoggi case to sanction multiple foreign individuals, paving the way for a potential use against any Saudi official potentially found responsible for the journalist\u2019s alleged murder. But beyond Trump\u2019s professed openness on Friday, the State Department has been cool to the prospect of an investigation, with spokeswoman Heather Nauert saying on Oct. 15 that lawmakers are \u201cgetting ahead of themselves at this point.\u201dWhen former President Barack Obama signed the human rights law at issue in 2016, he released a signing statement reserving the right to \u201cdecline to act on such requests where appropriate.\u201dBrian McKeon, a longtime Obama administration national security aide and former senior Pentagon official, said, \u201cI think the president\u2019s lawyers will be saying to him, as they did in writing that signing statement for Obama, that a letter from a handful of members of Congress can\u2019t require the president to make a determination.\u201d \u201cThe Trump administration could either write back and say, \u2018We don\u2019t think this is a valid provision of law under the Constitution,\u2019\u201d added McKeon, who\u2019s now at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cOr they could, as a matter of comity, to avoid upsetting people, write back within 120 days and say we\u2019re going to do the following number of things.\u201dIf the administration tries to wait out the current crisis or offer what lawmakers deem perfunctory punishment, then it could be up to next year\u2019s Congress \u2014 potentially divided between a Democratic House and a GOP Senate \u2014 to try to work on a response with more teeth. The two parties successfully worked together on a Russia sanctions bill last year in response to Moscow\u2019s electoral meddling, but it remains to be seen whether any Saudi sanctions bill could muster the same veto-proof majority that the Russia legislation notched.Four months \u201cshould be enough for them to come to us with a serious determination as to whether there was any foul play here,\u201d one Senate Democratic aide said. \u201cI do agree if the pressure is maintained or increases, and if the White House continues to downplay things, Congress will likely act on its own. Whether or not that means targeted sanctions \u2014 that\u2019s likely, but I wouldn\u2019t say that is the only option that exists.\u201dBurgess Everett contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?
