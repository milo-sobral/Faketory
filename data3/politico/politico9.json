Martha McSally, who is in a tight race with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.Trump has been telling aides and allies in recent days that he feels good about his party\u2019s chances of not only picking up Senate seats, but maintaining control of the House, if everything breaks his way.The president\u2019s cautious optimism that Republicans will defy history by keeping the number of losses in Congress\u2019 lower chamber to a minimum is due in large part to what he views as his record of success, which he considers unmatched by any of his modern predecessors. One presidential adviser compared Trump\u2019s reasoning to his attitude about fighting off Democratic-led impeachment \u2014 saying he feels like the job he\u2019s done should insulate him from political punishment.Trump, more than a half-dozen of his advisers told POLITICO, is deeply skeptical of public polls showing anything approaching a blue wave election \u2014 in part because he personally experienced surveys predicting his doom during the 2016 campaign, before pulling out the upset over Hillary Clinton.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Now, can [the candidate] get people to show up to Election Day?\u201d a Republican close to the president told POLITICO. \u201cThat\u2019s the hope. That\u2019s why we have them stand on the stage with the president.\u201d\u201cHe puts his arm around them and says, \u2018come out in November.\u2019 That\u2019s something President Obama didn\u2019t do,\u201d to the same degree, \u201cand President Bush couldn\u2019t do.\u201dInternally, Trump has stressed the need to stay motivated and flexible \u2014 mostly avoiding engaging in talk about planning for losing, while opening a new messaging front in the final weeks before the midterms focused on Democrats\u2019 treatment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S., law and order and common sense.\u201cDemocrats produce mobs,\u201d he said in unveiling a new attack line that has drawn big cheers on the Western swing. \u201cRepublicans produce jobs.\u201dIn Arizona, Trump torched Sinema as a \"far-left extremist\" who protested American involvement in Afghanistan while McSally was fighting in combat. \"A vote for Kyrsten Sinema is a wasted vote, and more importantly, it is a dangerous vote if you don't want Schumer, cryin' Chuck, for [Nancy] Pelosi and Maxine Waters,\" Trump said, adding that a vote for McSally would be \"the second greatest vote you'll ever cast\" \u2014 the greatest being a vote for him.But hearkening back to lines from the 2016 campaign trail, he slammed \"bad hombres\" immigrating illegally to the U.S., later pointedly asking Hispanic attendees in the crowd whether they supported him or not.\"And catch and release, how about that? That's my favorite,\" Trump said of the practice of releasing undocumented immigrants detained at the border. \"Catch. You catch a damn killer. You catch a bad hombre. You catch a bad one.\"The president has seized on reports of a so-called \"caravan\" of Central American migrants, many of whom reportedly plan to seek asylum in the U.S., as fresh evidence that Democrats have failed to enact tough immigration policies like his long-proposed border wall. Repeating a favorite line of his, Trump said the notion that \"good people\" are coming across the border is simply untrue.Earlier in the day, he told reporters that \u201cmany of those people \u2013 a fairly big percentage, of those people, are criminals.\u201d\"You think they're all wonderful people. You've got some bad people in those groups,\" Trump said. \u201cYou've got some tough people in those groups. And I'll tell you what, this country doesn't want them. OK?\"When pressed before the rally if he had any evidence that undocumented immigrants were bad people, specifically \"hardened people,\" Trump lashed out at the reporter.\"Oh, please. Please,\" Trump said, emphasizing that he did not say it applied to all immigrants. \"Don't be a baby. OK?\"Missing out on the latest scoops?
