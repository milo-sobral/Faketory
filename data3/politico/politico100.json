Bill Nelson in his race would turn up more votes. But it didn\u2019t happen, and Nelson is sure to lose as well. The 2018 Florida midterm election results are scheduled to be certified Tuesday. \u201cWe said we would fight until the last vote is counted. We are now closing out the hand recount phase in two of the statewide races,\u201d Gillum said in a Facebook video address, referring to Nelson\u2019s contest and the race for agriculture commissioner, where Nikki Fried appears to be the only Democrat elected statewide.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that every single vote including those that were overvotes, undervotes \u2014 as long as it was a legally cast vote \u2014 we wanted those votes to be counted,\u201d Gillum said, standing next to his wife and adding that they \u201cwanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida.\u201d\nThe 39-year-old mayor of Tallahassee came closer than any other Democrat in 20 years to beating a Republican candidate for governor. Gillum\u2019s unlikely win in the Democratic primary and his dynamic speaking style earned him a national fan base, and signaled that he\u2019s likely to run for office again because, he said, his campaign was part of a \u201cmovement.\u201dIn conceding, Gillum opted not to keep his options open by contesting the election, a long-shot effort that he and his advisers believed would be doomed to fail and corrosive for his brand. Even President Donald Trump, who trashed Gillum as corrupt and feckless, had kind words about Gillum and said he was someone to watch.\u201cCongratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cHe will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with!\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
