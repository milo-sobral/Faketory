Dean Heller (R-Nev.) breaking with President Donald Trump in his reelection campaign, given Nevada's swing-state status and Heller's refusal before the 2016 election to say whether he'd vote for Trump.But on Saturday, the two were acting like old pals. Standing onstage in this small rural city in the far reaches of Northern Nevada, Heller basked in the glow of the president, who trekked cross-country to stump for his onetime skeptic.Story Continued BelowThe president praised the senator for his collaboration on tax reform and veterans issues. Heller declared the president\u2019s first two years a triumph: \u201cWelcome to Trump country!\u201d he beamed, turning to Trump. \u201cMr. President, you know a little bit about gold. In fact, I think everything you touch turns to gold.\u201dTrump has nursed some legendary grudges. But his union of obligation with Heller, coming after their turbulent start, underscores what his advisers describe as the president\u2019s increasing comfort with bending to political imperatives the longer he's in the White House. And it provides insight into his evolution from anti-establishment interloper to party leader whose fortunes are now closely linked with Republicans.On his swing though Nevada, Arizona and Montana this week, Trump touted his alliances with former rivals, brandishing his capacity for political absolution like a United Nations peacekeeper might carry the blue helmet. \u201cYou know, you go to wars together and then, if you\u2019re smart, and if they\u2019re smart, you get along,\u201d Trump said Thursday at his stop in Missoula, Mont. He went on to say he has \"great relationships\" with his 2016 rivals. \u201cTed Cruz has become a friend of mine. He\u2019s doing great. And Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee,\u201d he said, adding to the list of former adversaries. Left unmentioned were Trump\u2019s earlier spats with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), whose cellphone number he shared with the world, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), whom, during an early presidential debate, Trump suggested was ugly. Now, the two senators are golf buddies and among Trump's closest friends in the Senate.\nElections\n                    By MARY LEEOn Monday, Trump will rally at an 18,000-seat arena in Houston for Cruz, who is facing a stiff challenge from Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic darling and national fundraising juggernaut. On Wednesday, the president will be in Mosinee, Wis., to rally for Gov. Scott Walker, another 2016 foe whose state is key to Trump's reelection hopes.\u201cIf you look at Trump and his history \u2014 he\u2019s always willing to make nice with people who will make nice with him,\u201d a former White House official said.Trump doesn\u2019t need to have a deep personal connection to appreciate someone\u2019s value. In some cases, he prefers a comfortable but arm's-length pact based on mutual respect and utility, according to more than a half-dozen White House aides and outside presidential advisers. This year, Republicans\u2019 efforts to maintain Senate control have been made easier by Trump\u2019s tendency to let bygones be bygones. Martha McSally, a GOP congresswoman running to succeed Trump detractor Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), declined to endorse Trump in 2016.But Trump resisted wading into McSally\u2019s primary against hard-line conservatives Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio, the ex-Maricopa County sheriff whom the president pardoned last year for criminal contempt of court. On Friday, Trump headlined a Scottsdale fundraiser benefiting a joint committee of McSally, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Arizona Republican Party that raised more than $700,000, said a person familiar with the event. Later, Trump sang the praises of McSally, a former pilot who was stationed in the Middle East, while they toured Luke Air Force Base and again at his midterm rally at a hangar in Mesa.\u201cMartha\u2019s a veteran, a great veteran, a great fighter, a warrior,\u201d Trump said, contrasting her background with her Democratic rival's. \u201cWhile Martha was bravely fighting the Taliban, Kyrsten Sinema said she had no problem with Americans defecting from our country to join the Taliban.\u201d\nWhite House\n                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO and BRENT D. GRIFFITHSTrump's evolution with Cruz is especially striking. In 2016, Trump suggested that Cruz's father was involved in JFK's assassination and seemed to imply that the senator's wife was ugly. Cruz returned the favor by announcing onstage at the Republican National Convention that Republicans should \"vote your conscience.\"Government aides to Trump and Cruz now communicate regularly, and the president and senator have spoken directly on everything from funding for hurricane disaster relief to trade policy to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominations, according to a senior Republican official with insight into the connection. Along the way came little breakthroughs.In the midst of the health care fight last year, Cruz saw the opportunity to debate Sen. Bernie Sanders live on CNN as a way to highlight what Republicans view as Sanders\u2019 outside-the-mainstream support for \"Medicare for all,\" as well as to show that he could be a team player by helping advance the GOP and Trump agendas. Trump was pleased enough with the performance he reached out to Cruz to tell him he did a good job. (One aide familiar with the exchange noted the president did not explicitly say he tuned in to CNN, his favorite media punching bag.)Among Trump\u2019s political relationships, his pact with Heller is most indicative of his approach. The senator holds a slight lead over Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in recent public polls.\u201cThe president is well aware of the challenging political nature of Nevada, and he appreciates that Sen. Heller has done a really good job in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Bill Stepien, the White House political director, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy place to get elected. It\u2019s not an easy place to get reelected.\u201dThe lone Senate Republican fighting to hold a state carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016, Heller that year wouldn\u2019t say who he was voting for. After the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape leaked, the senator famously said he was \u201c100 percent against Clinton, 99 percent against Trump.\u201d\nWhite House \n                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and BEN SCHRECKINGEREarly in the Trump presidency, one Republican strategist here recalled the anger directed at the senator in conversations with local activists around the state. If Heller remained on that path, \u201cit would have been curtains,\u201d said Bob List, a former Nevada governor.Heller stood alongside Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval in announcing his opposition to Obamacare repeal legislation. In July 2017, Trump jokingly threatened Heller by noting \u201che wants to remain a senator\u201d in reference to whether Heller would vote for the Republican plan.But in private sessions concerning alternative health care legislation proposed by Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Trump and Heller got to know each other better, aides said. Their work grew more serious when Heller was in the thick of helping write and pass the tax overhaul as part of the Finance Committee. While the tax bill gave Trump and Heller something to tout, the aides said it was more narrowly focused bills \u2014 many on veterans issues \u2014 that cemented the association. Finally, last fall, Heller said in a statement to The Nevada Independent that he did end up voting for Trump. \u201cI think he sensed that people appreciate the administration, and he knows he\u2019s on the right side when he\u2019s in line with the president,\u201d List said.Nevada Democrats have sought to exploit the old tensions. Sarah Abel, press secretary for the state party, said Heller\u2019s \u201ctotal 180 flip-flop on Donald Trump is the perfect example of how he's a self-serving career politician who will say anything if he thinks it helps him politically.\u201dTrump, for his part, acknowledges the rocky start he and Heller had. In June, he said they went from \u201cshaky\u201d to \u201crock solid.\u201d At his Las Vegas rally with Heller in September, Trump spoke about the transition from disliking to respecting and then liking each other. \u201cThen,\" Trump added, \"we started to love each other.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
