Of the veterans identified, according to the data, more than 25,000 are already in default on their debt. \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos earlier this year announced plans to identify and inform veterans with disabilities that they\u2019re eligible to have their federal student loans discharged. The Education Department matched its student loan records with disability records provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2013 and sent customized letters explaining veterans\u2019 rights to have their loans canceled. Veterans must sign and return an application in order to obtain the loan discharge.\u2014 But veterans\u2019 groups and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have urged the Education Department to automatically provide the loan discharges, expressing concern about the paperwork burden, especially for veterans who are severely disabled.\u2014 The Education Department has previously said that it can\u2019t automatically forgive the loans because of the potential tax consequences of the loan discharge. The Republican tax law, H.R. 1 (115), last year removed any federal tax liability associated with loans canceled through the program. But the department reiterated in its FOIA response on Friday that it\u2019s still concerned about the \u201cpotential state tax implications\u201d associated with the loan discharges.\u2014 Veterans Education Success and several other groups sent a letter to DeVos on Friday that suggests that the state tax issues are largely overblown, urging automatic loan cancellations with an opt-out option. \u201cIt is not fair to ask severely disabled veterans to have to complete paperwork, especially given that some catastrophic disabilities will interfere with their ability to complete the paperwork,\u201d the groups wrote. Read the letter here.\u2014 Senate Democrats also sent a letter to DeVos on Friday, asking her to automatically discharge the loans. The letter, led by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), also urges the department to address inadvertent data errors in the process for identifying disabled veterans.

Democrats have said that oversight of the Education Department and DeVos will be a priority in the coming Congress.\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201cIf I have to use them, they will be used in a methodical way,\u201c he said, \u201cand it must be in the public interest.\u201d Read more.
