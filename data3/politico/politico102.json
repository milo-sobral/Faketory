Cindy Hyde-Smith, whose once-bulletproof bid for another two years in the chamber has become increasingly imperiled following comments involving a public hanging and voter suppression.Trump\u2019s visit has been in the works for several days, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee is expected to spend more than $1 million on a TV ad blitz bolstering Hyde-Smith ahead of Election Day on Nov. 27.Story Continued BelowAppointed by Gov. Phil Bryant in March to fill retiring GOP Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s seat, Hyde-Smith is facing Democrat Mike Espy in a runoff election to serve out the remainder of Cochran\u2019s term, which ends in January 2021.But her campaign in deep-red Mississippi has become the subject of national scrutiny over the past week, after a video appeared on social media Sunday of the senator saying that if she were invited by one of her supporters to a \"public hanging,\" she would be in \"the front row.\"Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The president won Mississippi by nearly 18 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.Trump is scheduled to headline two Make America Great Again rallies for Hyde-Smith on Nov. 26, the eve of the election, in Tupelo and Biloxi. Those events will mark the president\u2019s first campaign stops since his mad dash of appearances across the country leading up to the midterm elections on Nov. 6.\u201cPresident Trump is so committed to getting out the vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith that he scheduled two rallies in the great State of Mississippi on the day before the run-off election,\u201d Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner said in a news release. \u201cThe President needs all hands on deck on Election Day on November 27 so he can continue to count on Senator Hyde-Smith\u2019s outstanding support for his America First agenda.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
