Ron Phillips of Gavel Resources, a former House Armed Services Committee staffer, started representing Prince in September and reported lobbying Congress and the Defense Department on his behalf in a disclosure filing. In an interview, Phillips said he\u2019s set up meetings for Prince with members of Congress and administration officials so Prince can discuss his proposal to turn much of the Afghan war over to private security contractors. \u201cThere is no ask other than he\u2019s providing information,\u201d Phillips said. Bill Jarrell, a former aide to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and a Gavel partner, is working on the effort, too.Story Continued Below\u2014 Prince has been talking up his vision for remaking the Afghan war for more than a year. \u201cMy proposal is for a sustainable footprint of 2,000 American Special Operations and support personnel, as well as a contractor force of less than 6,000 (far less than the 26,000 in country now),\u201d Prince wrote last year in an op-ed in The New York Times. \u201cThis team would provide a support structure for the Afghans, allowing the United States\u2019 conventional forces to return home.\u201d He\u2019s made his case to Afghan leaders in Kabul in recent months, and now he\u2019s focused on winning over Washington. He already has an in with the administration. President Donald Trump has discussed the proposal with Prince\u2019s sister, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, according to Phillips. \u201cErik has got his friends and he\u2019s got his foes, but the one thing you cannot deny is he understands unconventional warfare,\u201d Phillips said.MORE NEW BUSINESS: Lori Otto Punke, a former in-house lobbyist for Starbucks, has registered to lobby for the coffee giant through her firm, LOP Strategies. Juul Labs retained Layth Elhassani of Covington & Burling to lobby on tariffs, after recently adding Kountoupes Denham Carr & Reid and the S-3 Group to its expanding roster of lobbyists. (Juul spent $560,000 on Washington lobbying in the third quarter, up from $210,000 in the second quarter.) Chris Cox of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius have joined eBay\u2019s squad of outside lobbyists, which also includes half a dozen other firms. And Subject Matter picked up a quartet of new clients, including BP and Visa. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Marianne is on vacation this week, so I\u2019m helming PI solo.

The sessions will focus on how Facebook is seeking to safeguard its network ahead of the midterms, with an emphasis on its battle against 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' along the lines of what Russia did in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Full story.IF YOU MISSED IT ON TUESDAY: POLITICO\u2019s Nahal Toosi profiled Ali Shihabi, the Washington operative who leads the Arabia Foundation and defended Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. \u201cThe global outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s murder has forced many Washington lobbyists and public relations pros to cut ties with the Saudi government. But not Shihabi, a Saudi national who may be the country\u2019s most effective defender in the U.S. capital. Media savvy and politically shrewd, Shihabi has relationships with prominent journalists, Trump administration officials and think tank experts throughout Washington. The Saudi ambassador left Washington earlier this month and reportedly may not return, but it matters less given that many already consider Shihabi, who is close to the Saudi leadership, to be the kingdom\u2019s unofficial envoy.\u201d Full story.JOBS REPORT:\u2014 CAQH, a nonprofit whose members include big health insurers, has hired Mark Pratt to lead its state and federal affairs program and April Todd to lead its CORE and Explorations programs.
