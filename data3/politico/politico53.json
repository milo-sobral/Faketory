But Trump argued in an interview with Axios that he could revoke it by executive order.Story Continued BelowCourt decisions dating back to the late 1800s affirm the citizenship rights of children born to immigrants, which would make it even harder to enforce such an executive order.Nearly all legal experts accept that the amendment applies to nearly all children born on U.S. soil, according to Josh Blackman, a conservative constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston.\u201cThis is not an issue where there\u2019s a lot of disagreement,\u201d Blackman said. If Trump issues an executive order, he said, \u201csomeone will challenge it in five seconds.\u201dSign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

According to one argument \u2014 which most legal experts reject \u2014 the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d phrase excludes noncitizens because they can\u2019t vote, serve on juries, or be tried for treason.But even backers of these approaches typically dismiss the idea that birthright citizenship can be eliminated by presidential fiat.Rogers Smith, a left-leaning University of Pennsylvania political science professor who specializes in constitutional law, has argued that the Constitution doesn't require that birthright citizenship be extended to undocumented individuals, and that Congress could pass a law denying it to them. But \u201cI know of no remotely plausible legal theory,\" Smith said, \"under which the president has the power to decide birthright citizenship rules by executive order.\"\u201cNo one except the Trump White House thinks it\u2019s a matter of executive discretion,\u201d Smith told POLITICO in an email. \u201cTrump\u2019s announcement of this position a week before the election is clearly playing politics with people\u2019s civic status and lives in the worst possible way.\u201dThe White House considered action on birthright citizenship a priority from the start of the administration, according to Jessica Vaughan, a policy director with the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies, but first it needed to explore whether an executive order was feasible or preferable to legislation. The executive-order idea surfaced publicly in July in an op-ed by Michael Anton, a former spokesman for the National Security Council who left the Trump administration three months earlier.\"An executive order could specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens,\" Anton wrote in July. \"Such an order would, of course, immediately be challenged in the courts. But officers in all three branches of government \u2014 the president no less than judges \u2014 take similar oaths to defend the Constitution. Why shouldn\u2019t the president act to defend the clear meaning of the 14th Amendment?\"\nCongress \n                    By BURGESS EVERETT and CAITLIN OPRYSKOAnton, who doesn\u2019t have a law degree, is a lecturer and research fellow at Hillsdale College, an institution with strong ties to the conservative movement. His op-ed was widely criticized from both left and right \u2014 a rebuke that he wrote about in a subsequent blog post that blasted anti-Trump conservatives.\"I did not expect self-described 'conservatives' to be just as hysterical as the Left,\" Anton wrote in the blog post, \"and to use precisely the same terms. 'Nativist.' 'Xenophobe.' 'Bigot.' 'Racist.' 'White nationalist.' 'White supremacist.' ... It\u2019s an ugly thing to hear and read the worst of these epithets from ostensible allies.\"The bipartisan legal consensus in favor of the current understanding of birthright citizenship would make a Trump challenge unlikely to succeed, according to Gerard Magliocca, a professor at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.\u201cIf this ever did reach the Supreme Court, you would get probably eight or nine votes to say it\u2019s unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cThe liberal wing of the court won\u2019t like it because they\u2019re not going to like something like this generally. But the conservative wing of the court that believes in following the original meaning of the Constitution cannot possibly look at that and say anything other than, \u2018Everyone born here is a citizen.\u2019\u201dThe high court tackled birthright citizenship in the 1898 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which addressed whether a child born to Chinese parents now living in the U.S. would automatically be a citizen.The case dealt with legal immigration \u2014 at the time, there were no federal immigration laws to designate someone an undocumented immigrant \u2014 but the justices ruled the San Francisco-born Wong Kim Ark was a citizen.Aside from Native Americans born on tribal lands, the Supreme Court excluded only two groups: children of foreign diplomats and children of enemy occupiers, according to Stephen Legomsky, former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration.\u201cI expect that even the current Supreme Court will find this to be too great a stretch,\u201d he said in a written statement.A 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center found Republicans split on whether to bar children of undocumented immigrants from obtaining citizenship. And Trump\u2019s proposal \u2014 at least as it was reported this week \u2014 could apply to non-citizens in the country legally, too.\u201cI don\u2019t see this going anywhere,\u201d said Blackman, the professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston. \u201cI see this mostly a way to rally support with the election coming up in a few days.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
