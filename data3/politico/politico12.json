Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his campaign for reelection on Friday and endorsed former Democratic Sen. Mark Begich \u2014 scrambling the state's three-way gubernatorial race with just over two weeks until Election Day.The move, first reported by the Alaska Dispatch News, comes just days after Walker's lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, resigned, citing \"inappropriate comments\" he had made to an unidentified woman. Walker appointed state Department of Health and Social Services Commissioner Valerie Davidson to the post and vowed to press on with his reelection campaign.Story Continued BelowBut, on Friday afternoon, Walker announced at the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention that he was ending his bid for a second term and posted a statement to his campaign's website. He said the decision to abandon his campaign was \"not the first difficult decision I have made this week, but it is one I know I must make.\" Walker's decision could boost Begich against Republican Mike Dunleavy, a former state senator. Recent poling showed Walker and Begich hovering at around a quarter of the vote, with Dunleavy well ahead, with support over 40 percent. Walker will remain on the ballot, with Mallott as his running mate, though neither is an active candidate.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.
