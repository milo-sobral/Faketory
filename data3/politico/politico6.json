He moderated the U.S. military response to Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons and openly opposed Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal.Story Continued BelowNow Trump\u2019s reverence for the retired four-star general has worn thin, and Mattis is widely expected to depart his post sometime after the November elections, according to multiple Pentagon and administration officials with knowledge of personnel discussions. And that\u2019s fueling anxiety among officials of both parties who have viewed him for almost two years as a force for stability.\"Secretary Mattis is one of the only reassuring figures in the Trump administration, and I don\u2019t mean that as a Democratic partisan,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a member of the Appropriations Committee's defense panel. \"I mean when our partners and our adversaries think about the United States and the Department of Defense, knowing that Secretary Mattis is there strengthens our hand.\"Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

McMaster with leading hawk John Bolton, and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with conservative stalwart Mike Pompeo.\"Replacements might not be as good, just like Bolton was a real trade down from McMaster,\u201d predicted Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.Mattis\u2019 departure from Trump\u2019s inner circle would also come at a time when much of the top military leadership, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford, are also preparing to retire. Mattis' successor would have major influence on the complexion of the new military command structure that Trump would nominate next year.\"If he leaves, you inject a whole issue of uncertainty,\" Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services panel, told reporters earlier this week. \"Who's going to succeed him?\u201dFor Kaine, the uncertainty goes well beyond just Mattis, whose overwhelming Senate confirmation includes yes votes from members who opposed virtually all other Trump nominees.\"Secretary Mattis and Gen. Dunford are the real pillars of protecting American national security right now,\" he said. \"Either of them going, I think, would be extremely damaging to American defense and the credibility of our national security team.\"That view rests on Mattis\u2019 reputation for a steady hand and a steady voice in the inner circle. Mattis is widely viewed as a force for continuity from the Obama administration on some of the biggest national security issues, including Iran policy and the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.On Afghanistan and the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Mattis successfully championed strategies that broadly echoed the Obama administrations approaches to the campaigns \u2014 and rejected Trump\u2019s own impulses toward more drastic changes. Rather than authorizing the \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d against ISIS that Trump talked about during his campaign, or encouraging the president\u2019s desire to pull out of Afghanistan, Mattis largely maintained the strategies the military was already pursuing in both theaters, with some tweaks such as giving field commanders more authority for air strikes.Mattis has also made public remarks that seem calculated to shut the door to policy options that reportedly intrigued the president \u2014 such as privatizing the combat advisory effort in Afghanistan, a proposal pushed by Blackwater founder Erik Prince.Mattis\u2019 more subtle approach has also been successful in the U.S. response to the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against civilians. \nDefense \n                    By REBECCA MORINWhen Mattis and Dunford briefed Trump on Central Command\u2019s five potential military options for punishing Syria, Mattis characterized the most restrained option \u2014 limited strikes against three targets \u2014 as more muscular than it really was, according to a military official involved in the deliberations who described them on condition of anonymity. \u201cHe presented the lightest option as a heavy option,\u201d the official recalled. And Trump signed off on it.On Iran policy, Mattis has clashed more openly with the president, unsuccessfully opposing his decision to pull out of the pact negotiated by the Obama administration to try to curtail Tehran's nuclear weapons program.That independence has steadily frayed the relationship between Mattis and the commander-in-chief.In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Trump called his defense chief \"sort of a Democrat.\" That slap came on the heels of journalist Bob Woodward's book \"Fear,\" which quoted Mattis as disparaging the president.Mattis, who was traveling in Asia when Trump made the comment, told reporters: \"I've never registered for any political party.\"\"I'm on his team,\" Mattis added of Trump. \"We have never talked about me leaving.\u201dHe also told the reporters that Trump had called to tell him, \"I\u2019m 100 percent with you.\"But many close observers believe the writing is on the wall about Mattis' fate \u2014 especially if the growing friction continues to play out publicly as it had with Tillerson.\u201cPOTUS is getting rid of him after midterms,\" said the same military official, who agreed to discuss knowledge of internal White House deliberations on the condition he not be identified by name. \"It\u2019s something they\u2019ve wanted to do for a while. They weren\u2019t going to do it before midterms.\u201d\"Mattis has executed his own foreign policy,\" the official added. \"He was able to get away with it by partnering with Tillerson and making McMaster irrelevant. Now with Pompeo and Bolton in, the jig is up.\u201dLoren Thompson, a defense industry consultant with close ties to the Pentagon leadership, put it this way: \"What it comes down to is that Trump and Mattis don't see eye to eye. Trump is a change agent and Mattis is largely a product of the existing viewpoint, the status quo.\"He stopped doing those dinners with the president,\" he added. \"I think they have drifted apart and they probably aren't on the same sheet of music in terms of priorities anymore. \"For many, that is exactly why they worry about what follows.Keeping Mattis is a matter of stability, Reed believes. He said he worries that a new civilian leader will have to get up to speed even as a raft of top generals and admirals begins to retire en masse.In addition to Dunford, whose term is up in September 2019, several members of the Joint Chiefs, including Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman, are expected to retire next year.\nWhite House \n                    By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and BEN SCHRECKINGERSeveral top commanders responsible for various regions of the world or other global missions are also likely to be selected in the coming months. For example, Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top commander in Europe, is retiring.\"If he is gone and there is another secretary of Defense, you\u2019re going to see next year \u2026 everybody new around the water cooler trying to figure out where the bathroom is,\u201d Reed told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be good for national defense.\"Others say the bipartisan support that Mattis has enjoyed on Capitol Hill could be difficult to replicate.\u201cIt would be hard to imagine that person having quite the same rapport,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, a military and foreign policy specialist at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. \"It\u2019s almost inevitable that the next person would have less of a bond with Democrats, but it could be much worse than that. It could be almost a poisonous relationship.\u201dNot everyone is convinced that Mattis is on his way out, including O'Hanlon, who said he believes the Defense secretary still offers Trump some political benefits. Another senior administration official said he believes it would still be difficult for Trump to terminate someone with Mattis\u2019 reputation without justification \u2014 though he might try to push the secretary out bit by bit by criticizing him.\u201cIf he can\u2019t tell you to find the exit, he\u2019ll make you want to find the exit,\" said the official, who was not authored to speak publicly about internal deliberations. \"This may be one of those cases where it\u2019s not worth the daily knife fight.\u201d Others believe Mattis won\u2019t leave unless he\u2019s fired \u2014 as one retired senior military officer and longtime friend of Mattis predicted.\u201cI would be very surprised if he leaves without being told to leave,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition he not be named. \u201cHis whole view is, leave the politics to the side and forge ahead.\u201d Those who see Mattis is a bulwark against more extreme policies \u2014 particularly Democratic lawmakers \u2014 say they hope Mattis does stick around. \"It is alarming to think that his tenure would come to an end,\" Schatz said. \"I think it\u2019s in the president\u2019s interest to keep him. I think it\u2019s in the country\u2019s interest to keep him. And I think it\u2019s in the interest of peace and stability to keep him. Which probably means he won\u2019t keep him.\"Missing out on the latest scoops?
