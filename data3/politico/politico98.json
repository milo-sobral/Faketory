Story Continued BelowBATTLE OVER THE BORDER WALL: President Donald Trump still wants funding for that border wall \u2014 and the lame duck session that begins Tuesday might his best shot at it for the next two years. House Republicans plan to push a bill from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, H.R. 7059 (115), that would devote $25 billion to border barriers and technology. On the Senate side, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sees $5 billion as a more realistic sum. But without concessions, Democrats are unlikely to agree to either amount.Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said recently that lawmakers could pair wall funding with a fix for \u201cDreamers\u201d covered by the DACA program. But bipartisan negotiations along those lines floundered in the Senate back in February, and there\u2019s no reason to believe it would fly this time around. In February, the White House repeatedly torpedoed the bills with the most bipartisan support \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine that dynamic changing now.The border wall was Trump\u2019s signature promise during the 2016 campaign, but he hasn\u2019t gotten much funding yet. Congress devoted $1.7 billion to new and replacement barriers in fiscal year 2017 and 2018, according to an analysis by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. That\u2019s a fraction of the $18 billion the administration requested in February for a two-year period.

The ACLU filed a complaint Friday over the fast-track regulation and presidential proclamation, and later pressed the court to issue a temporary restraining order. The regulation and proclamation cut off asylum for migrants who enter the U.S. between ports of entry. Under federal immigration law, migrants physically present in the U.S. may seek asylum whether or not they arrived at a port of entry. But the Trump administration argues that it has the authority to impose barriers to asylum \u2014 a theory that will be tested in court.The asylum bar extends to unaccompanied minors who arrive at the border. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services guidance posted online late Friday stated that unaccompanied kids who cross the border between ports of entry will be barred from seeking asylum. A Justice Department official said precisely the opposite on a call with reporters Friday morning \u2014 that unaccompanied minors would not be subject to the ban \u2014 but a DOJ spokesman confirmed that the USCIS guidance describes the true policy.SCOTUS COULD HEAR SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES: \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court will decide as soon as Nov. 30 whether to hear a trio of closely watched discrimination cases that ask the justices to decide whether Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination protects gay and transgender employees,\u201d Vin Gurrieri writes in Law360. \u201cThe dockets for the three Supreme Court cases \u2014 Altitude Express v. Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC \u2014 were each updated on Nov. 7 with an entry stating that the justices will consider cert petitions in all three matters during its Nov. 30 conference,\u201d Gurrieri writes. SCOTUS could decide whether to take up the cases at any time after that date. \u201cAll three cases have been closely monitored throughout the employment community as speculation has run rampant in recent years that the high court would take a case that clarifies at least the sexual orientation question, which for now is the subject of a deeper circuit split than is the gender identity question,\u201d Gurrieri writes.

The board will issue a proposed rule sometime this winter that will address the NLRB\u2019s \u2018blocking charge\u2019 policy to pause elections if workers or unions file complaints alleging employers interfered with the elections, Bloomberg reports, citing comments by NLRB Chairman John Ring at a Nov. 8 event.

A DOJ spokesperson confirmed that her last day was Friday and that she accepted a new job \"a while back\" but didn't reveal details about the new role. Cutrona, who previously served as chief counsel to then-Senator Sessions on the Judiciary Committee, handled immigration issues on Trump\u2019s transition team.TRIBUNE PLANS LAYOFFS AFTER MASS SHOOTING: Tribune Publishing (the company formerly known as Tronc), told staffers last week that it will offer buyouts to employees \u2014 and partly pinned the job cuts on costs related to a June shooting at the Annapolis-based Capital Gazette, Kimberly Pierceall reports in the Virginian-Pilot. Predictably, journalists both inside and outside the company blasted the decision to link job cuts to the tragic shooting, which took the lives of five employees. \u201cThe company provided grief counseling and quickly relocated the Capital-Gazette offices, while finding and preparing a new permanent home. But to mention the costs -- and not the lives -- even just to investors -- is disgusting,\u201d tweeted Scott Dance, a reporter at the Baltimore Sun (another Tribune property).
