Scott Applewhite/AP PhotoTHE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL HELP PELOSI -- @realDonaldTrump at 6:37 a.m.: \u201cI can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it -- but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win! @TomReedCongress\u201d. -- TRUMP, via a pool report from from Linda Feldmann of the Christian Science Monitor: \"I\u2019m not saying I'd get any [votes from] the super conservative side, but maybe I even get them from there. But I don\u2019t imagine she\u2019d need too many. But whatever number of votes she needs, if it's 50 or 10 or 2 or 1, she\u2019s got em from [me], automatic. So tell her opposition, they\u2019re wasting their time.\u201d PELOSI RESPONDS ... DREW HAMMILL, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff: \u201cLeader Pelosi will win the Speakership with Democratic votes.\u201d -- ALSO ... ANY REPUBLICAN who votes for Pelosi would probably get a primary challenge. Kevin McCarthy -- who is flying with Trump to California today -- might have a different take on this. NOTES ON THE SPEAKER RACE \u2026 ONE OF THE NICE things about the Capitol is that reporters have the ability to go everywhere, and lawmakers truly can\u2019t escape us. (Newly elected Democrats are getting accustomed to that). NANCY PELOSI\u2019S office is connected to the Rayburn Room, a large space on the second floor of the Capitol -- and that\u2019s where a bunch of the press corps was camped out yesterday afternoon. It allowed us to see practically everyone who walked into Pelosi\u2019s office -- although they could escape through a back entrance on the way out. IT WAS AN INTERESTING scene. Pelosi had a rotating cast of lawmakers cycling in and out of the office all day. She would ask new lawmakers about their priorities, their districts and they emerged seemingly positive about their interactions with Pelosi. MIKIE SHERRILL, a Democrat who won the New Jersey seat held for decades by GOP Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, wouldn\u2019t say a word about who she would vote for when she emerged from a meeting with Pelosi -- despite saying she was against Pelosi on the campaign trail. HALEY STEVENS, a Michigan Democrat, said she hasn\u2019t said no to voting for Pelosi.ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, the Democrat who beat Virginia Rep. Dave Brat, said her conversation with Pelosi was positive, but she would be keeping her campaign promise and voting against her. -- LIZZIE FLETCHER, who beat longtime Texas Rep. John Culberson in Houston, came out in support of Pelosi. As did Katie Porter of California.IT SEEMED as if Pelosi was methodically hearing out everyone in the Democratic caucus. At around 3 p.m., the press corps asked Pelosi\u2019s team how many more meetings she had. They said she would squeeze in another six meetings before the end of the day, before three evening events.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

PELOSI attended a Democracy Alliance event at the Capitol Hilton, where she was introduced as \"the original badass woman in Washington and the next speaker of the House.\" PELOSI on winning on health care -- \u201cTwo years ago after the election so many people were sad but we said, \u2018we don\u2019t agonize, we organize.\u2019 And working together we did that. The very next day we had our conference call with the groups. By next Sunday and ever widening circle of friends, putting together how we would protect the Affordable Care Act.\"We made a plan to launch on Martin Luther King Weekend \u2013 which we did... The next day, the brightest day, in spontaneous, organic activism on Washington turned into a march around the world. Much of it focused on health care, women\u2019s health care, family planning, lots of other issues as well \u2013 but all shared values. Women marched, and then they ran, and then they won.\"MEANWHILE, there has been a lot of chatter about a letter from 20 or so rebels saying they will not vote for Pelosi. That letter has yet to surface, and Pelosi continues to grind. No one knows how this will end up. -- WAPO\u2019S MIKE DEBONIS on MASSACHUSETTS REP. SETH MOULTON: \u201cDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton, the hard-charging Marine who served four tours of duty in Iraq is leading the challenge to Rep. Nancy Pelosi and her bid for speaker \u2014 and is suddenly taking incoming fire from all quarters.\u201cProminent liberal activists are openly floating a primary challenge to the two-term Massachusetts congressman, the instigator of the nearly 20 Democratic foes to Pelosi and one who helped recruit several of the incoming freshmen opposing her.\u201cOutraged by the treatment of the first female House speaker, Pelosi\u2019s backers have characterized the effort as a sexist putsch and urged calls to Moulton\u2019s office as well as the other male Democratic opponents.\u201cInside the House, Moulton\u2019s ambition and sharp elbows have long been a subject of his colleagues\u2019 grumbling, and his latest fusillade at Pelosi \u2014 this time, after a sweeping electoral win \u2014 has angered even some of his admirers. \u2026 \u2018Never took responsibility for anything, and that\u2019s not what leaders do,\u2019 he said. \u2018A good selfless leader shares the credit for a win and owns mistakes.\u2019\u201d WaPoA message from Delta Air Lines:Connecting armed service members with their loved ones while they undergo treatment and recovery is a small way to say thank you to the men and women who bravely serve us.

Your reaction to the ruling, sir.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine I mean it\u2019s not a big deal. What they said though is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etc. etc. We\u2019re doing that, were going to write them up right now. It\u2019s not a big deal and if he misbehaves we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference.\u201d WALLACE: \u201cWhat are your rules going to be? What is it that you\u2019re saying?\u201d TRUMP: \u201cThey\u2019re doing them now.\u201d WALLACE: \u201c\u2018This is over the line and you lose your press pass.\u2019\u201d TRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re writing them now. We\u2019ll have rules of decorum you know you can\u2019t keep asking questions. We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts you know doing what he\u2019s supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements too. But I will say this look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave I will say thank you very much everybody I appreciate you coming and I\u2019ll leave. And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that\u2019s acting up.\u201d-- TRUMP on Veterans Day: WALLACE: \u201cBut here\u2019s the question, you\u2019re back in Washington on Monday, Veterans Day, why don\u2019t you go across the river to Arlington for that ceremony? Barack Obama went every year he was here in D.C.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cI should have done that, I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling as you know.\u201d WALLACE: \u201cBut this is Veteran\u2019s Day.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cI could have done that, as you know I just left the day before the American Cemetery and I probably think, and that was one where it was raining as hard as you can imagine and I made a speech at the American Cemetery the day before and I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state -- doing other things.\u201d WALLACE: \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d TRUMP: \u201cBut I would have -- I would have done it.\u201dTWO WAPO BOMBSHELLS \u2026 -- WAPO\u2019S SHANE HARRIS, GREG MILLER and JOSH DAWSEY: \u201cCIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s assassination\u201d: \u201cThe CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month, contradicting the Saudi government\u2019s claims that he was not involved in the killing, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s assessment, in which officials have said they have high confidence, is the most definitive to date linking Mohammed to the operation and complicates the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to preserve its relationship with a close ally. ...\u201cIn reaching its conclusions, the CIA examined multiple sources of intelligence, including a phone call that the prince\u2019s brother Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, had with Khashoggi, according to the people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence. \u201cKhalid told Khashoggi, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post, that he should go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents and gave him assurances that it would be safe to do so. It is not clear if Khalid knew that Khashoggi would be killed, but he made the call at his brother\u2019s direction, according to the people familiar with the call, which was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.\u201d WaPo-- WAPO\u2019S GREG MILLER and SOUAD MEKHENNET: \u201cWoman says she married Khashoggi in ceremony kept secret from his fiancee and some in his family\u201d: \u201cAn Egyptian woman says she married Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a religious ceremony in the United States this year, months before he was killed at a Saudi consulate in Turkey while seeking papers needed to marry a different woman. \u201cThe disclosure of the marriage, which Khashoggi appears to have kept hidden from his Turkish fiancee and even members of his family, adds to the complicated timeline of Khashoggi\u2019s final months before he was killed by a team of Saudi assassins in October.\u201cIn an interview, the woman said she was coming forward to reveal her relationship with Khashoggi because \u2018as a Muslim wife, I want my full right and to be recognized.\u2019\u201d WaPoMCCONNELL TO KUSHNER \u2026 THANKS, BUT NO THANKS \u2026 NYT\u2019S NICK FANDOS and MAGGIE HABERMAN: \u201cSenator Mitch McConnell told President Trump in a private meeting on Thursday that there is not likely to be enough time to bring a bipartisan criminal justice bill up for a vote this year, regardless of the support it has in the Senate and the White House, according to people familiar with the meeting. \u201cMr. McConnell, who as majority leader controls the Senate floor, delivered the news in a previously scheduled meeting at the White House convened to discuss the chamber\u2019s legislative agenda for the remaining weeks of the term. Lawmakers from both parties have been working furiously to build support for the compromise legislation that would begin to reverse some of the tough-on-crime federal policies of the 1980s and 1990s that incarcerated African-American offenders at much higher rates than white offenders.\u201d NYTELIANA JOHNSON: \u201cJohn Kelly makes final bid to save Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s job\u201d: \u201cWhite House chief of staff John Kelly is fighting to save Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security chief at whom President Donald Trump has lashed out for the rise in border apprehensions over the past several months. Kelly, whose fate in the administration is also unclear, is working to convince the president that Nielsen is not to blame for a recent surge in arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border that has enraged him, according to two sources familiar with the conversations.\u201cNielsen also has other supporters, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have told Trump that Nielsen cannot control the border crossing rate. ... Kelly\u2019s bid to save Nielsen may be motivated in part by an understanding that, with Nielsen gone, he would be almost completely isolated in an administration that several of his onetime allies have departed.\u201d POLITICO THE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026 -- WAPO\u2019S SPENCER HSU: \u201cMaria Butina, alleged Russian agent who met with NRA and other groups, is in plea talks\u201d: \u201cAttorneys for a Russian woman jailed on charges of seeking to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and other American conservative groups for the Russian government are in negotiations with federal prosecutors, both sides said in a court filing Friday. Lawyers for Maria Butina, 29, and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District made the disclosure about talks over a potential plea agreement in a two-page filing that asked U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan to postpone a Dec. 6 court hearing by about two weeks.\u201d WaPo TIM MILLER RESPONDS: \u201cSetting the Record Straight Regarding My Facebook Work\u201dPLAYBOOK METRO SECTION \u2013 \u201cNational Landing?

More than 8 million votes have been counted (twice). And an unprecedented statewide manual recount is all but over. So, too, it seems, is Bill Nelson\u2019s career in the U.S. Senate. Already clinging to the thinnest of reelection hopes, the Democrat\u2019s fast-fading campaign took what appeared to be fatal blows Friday when two court rulings went against him and a manual recount across Florida\u2019s 67 counties progressed smoothly and with little drama.\u201d Miami Herald-- \u201cStacey Abrams\u2019 defiant speech delights supporters, irks critics,\u201d by Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s Tia Mitchell and Greg Bluestein: \u201cStacey Abrams chose to end her gubernatorial campaign the way she ran it: by bucking conventional wisdom. Where other losing candidates have been subdued and conciliatory, she was defiant and bold. \u2026 [S]he knew her critics would have wanted her to say nice things about Republican Brian Kemp, but she didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving that kind of speech. ... \u201cThe Democrat wished Kemp well and said she will pray for his success as Georgia\u2019s governor. But she also blasted his tenure as secretary of state and promised to remain vocal on the issues of election reform and voter suppression.\u201d AJC-- \u201cRep.

The book is set to be published in January, two sources familiar with the project said. ... Sims\u2019 book, according to people familiar with the project, has been in the works for months and was described as a thoughtful and introspective portrayal of his time serving in the Trump White House.\u201cThe book is modeled, those people said, on George Stephanopoulos\u2019 tell-all memoir \u2018All Too Human,\u2019 a personal account of his time serving as communications director in the Clinton White House. ... He\u2019s also in competition with writers who are still telling the story from the inside out.
