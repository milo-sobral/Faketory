Biden responded in kind, telling a crowd of several hundred outside the local Culinary Union here that Trump was \u201cshredding\u201d basic decency and making a deliberate effort to divide the country.Story Continued BelowBiden said he decided to speak out against Trump after the president's response to white supremacists marching in Virginia last year. At the rally, Biden criticized the president\u2019s rhetoric on minorities, his embrace of Vladimir Putin and the separation of families at the Mexican border. \u201cIt\u2019s a conscious effort to divide the country,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberate. And it worked in part. We can\u2019t let it work again.\u201dA few minutes later, Trump punched back. \u201cI think he ran three times, and he never had more than 1 percent, so we call him \u2018One-Percent Joe,\u201d Trump said.\u201cAnd then remember what happened?\u201d he continued. \u201cObama came along and took him off the trash heap and made him vice president. But he never had more than 1 percent.\u201dYour guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Biden implored voters to send first-term Rep. Jacky Rosen to the Senate to help flip the majority; GOP Sen. Dean Heller has led narrowly in several recent public polls. Trump, meanwhile, rallied the GOP faithful behind the freshman senator, who praised him effusively despite their previously contentious relationship.Biden\u2019s rally was just the latest in a steady stream of visits to Nevada by Democrats eyeing 2020. Nevada is both a key swing state in the general election and the \u201cfirst in the West\u201d caucus, which could help propel the winner out of a likely crowded field of contenders. Nevada served as a significant proving ground for Hillary Clinton with nonwhite voters in 2016, giving her momentum heading into South Carolina and the Southern primaries that followed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said at the Nevada Democratic Party\u2019s state convention in June that the state marked a rare \u201cbright spot\u201d for Democrats two years ago. Clinton carried the state, while Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator. Democrats also flipped the state legislature. But Trump lost the state by only 2.4 percentage points, and Republicans expect to compete here in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just show who they are,\u201d Biden said of Trump and Republicans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tell them who we are. What do we stand for. What does the Democratic Party stand for today?\u201dBiden also touted his close relationship with former President Barack Obama, who won Nevada twice and will headline a rally for Rosen here on Monday.\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend, man,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI want to make it clear: All those memes, they\u2019re basically true. He made the first friendship bracelet, not me.\u201d\n                            \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just show who they are,\u201d Joe Biden said of President Donald Trump and the GOP. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tell them who we are.\" | Bryan Woolston/AP PhotoThis year, in addition to raising money for Rosen and making visits to the state\u2019s powerful Culinary Union, Democratic contenders have been requesting audiences with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who remains a powerful force in Democratic politics in Nevada and is expected to become involved in the 2020 presidential primary here.\u201cI\u2019m Joe Biden, and I work for Harry Reid,\u201d the former vice president said in kicking off his rally.Rosen has benefited from the big-name guests. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon joined her for a small event Saturday and will campaign with her in Reno on Sunday. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont will rally for her Thursday, and she\u2019s had fundraising help from Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Warren and Merkley. Warren headlined a state party event over the summer and got her own split-screen with Trump, who was rallying in Las Vegas that day.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, talked gun control with Democratic candidates during a swing through Las Vegas in April. Merkley held an event with Rosen on energy and environmental issues in the spring. Booker campaigned with candidates here in August, and, in a social media video for Rosen, said, \u201cThis state is in my blood.\u201dPerhaps no Democrat has campaigned as aggressively in Nevada as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. At a United Brotherhood of Carpenters International training center in Las Vegas last month, Garcetti noted that he was making his fifth trip this year.Relative newcomers to early primary politics, Nevada Democrats have relished their position on the primary calendar since the state became an early caucus state in 2008. Heightened attention on the contest here is viewed by Democrats as significant to increasing Democratic voter registration in a competitive state.Bob Fulkerson, state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund, a progressive group that runs registration and turnout operations in the state, said that as Democratic presidential contenders campaign for Nevada Democrats this year, \u201cThe oblique message is, \u2018Vote for me in the primary, too,\u2019 although they\u2019re classy enough not to say that.\u201d\nWhite House\n                    By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGOHe said, \u201cI think it\u2019s good. I think it really shows voters, particularly low-propensity voters, want to be talked to directly. \u2026 To have candidates come here and actually tell them that they matter is really important.\u201dWilliam McCurdy, the state Democratic Party chairman, said the state represents an important stop for any Democrat with ambitions to challenge Trump. He specifically touted Biden, Warren and Harris for having strong relationships with the party here.\u201cSome of these folks want to run for president in 2020, why not come interact with one of the most exciting bases in the country?\u201d McCurdy said.He added that he was pleased with how many potential 2020 contenders had made trips to Nevada, but he\u2019s not satisfied yet.\"We're looking for a few more; we want a few more,\u201d McCurdy said.Republicans view Nevada as a state in which Trump could compete two years from now. Trump has formed a close bond with Heller, who has won four statewide races here and has embraced the president as he\u2019s run for reelection.\u201cThis is Trump country now. He will win this state,\u201d said Michael McDonald, the Nevada GOP chairman. \u201cIf you look at the success he's had over 18 months, and I say that with all due respect to the former vice president, there's no one on that side of the aisle that can compete with President Trump.\"Democrats, obviously, disagree, and look at Nevada as central to their path to defeating Trump in two years. In this midterm year, Democrats are investing significantly in Latino turnout in Nevada in an effort not only to oust Heller, but also to capitalize on the state\u2019s changing demographics to close off any opening Trump might have.\u201cI think Nevadans here are going to pick anybody over Trump,\u201d said Megan Jones, a Democratic strategist in Nevada. \u201cAnd I think that in '20 they will be loaded up for bear no matter who the nominee is.\u201dWith such a large potential slate of candidates, no favorites have emerged yet. Margy Feldman, a retiree from Henderson who has been volunteering for Rosen, said before the rally that she loves Biden but is worried about his age. She said she was hoping for someone \"younger, that has super high energy\u201d and someone who isn\u2019t a \u201chousehold name.\"But immediately after Biden, 75, spoke, Feldman returned to amend her view: \u201cI\u2019m going to go vote for Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
