Story Continued BelowBIRDS OF PREY SETTLED ON ATHENAHEALTH?: Private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management are buying the EHR and practice management company for $5.5 billion, according to a Reuters report Sunday night. The company will hold a conference call later today after announcing third quarter earnings Friday. Athenahealth earnings were up 9 percent from the same quarter last year, thanks in part to layoffs that were part of the restructuring that began when Elliott drove out founder Jonathan Bush and hired former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as chairman last spring. \u2026Expectations of the sale have raised concerns among customers, who worry that the company will lose the human element of its service, one of its main attractions, Morning eHealth\u2019s Mohana Ravindranath reports. \u2026 Athenahealth sells its software mostly to small, independent practices. Some elements of those systems are automated, but athenahealth employees remotely manage key operations. The service business has always been athenahealth\u2019s selling point \u2013 \u201cletting doctors be doctors,\u201d notes Todd Rothenhaus, the company\u2019s former chief medical officer. Longtime customers tell POLITICO that while the technology isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s the responsiveness of the staff \u2013 and the willingness of executives to talk to them personally \u2013 that keeps them using athenahealth.NURX WURX, APPARENTLY: Providing easy access to birth control and AIDS prevention drugs has proven to be smart business for startup Nurx (it recently obtained $36 million in funding) \u2013 and has attracted some politically connected Democrats. The startup offers an app that patients use to connect with doctors via telemedicine and texts to obtain birth control and HIV-prevention drugs. In an interview with Darius Tahir, CEO Hans Gangeskar announced that former Surgeon General Regina Benjamin is joining the company\u2019s board of directors, which also includes Chelsea Clinton. \u201cWe wanted someone with a history in public health who is passionate about expanding access \u2026 someone who can help us figure out how to reach all these people who we, from the outset, wanted to reach: people in rural areas who often been going through abstinence-only sex education, and are struggling to navigate this space,\u201d Gangeskar said.

Wilkie praised the work of Pentagon and VA officials collaborating on the Cerner EHR implementation, among other projects, saying veterans\u2019 satisfaction was on the rise. \u201cWe are on the cusp of the VA\u2019s greatest transformation since Omar Bradly sat in the chair I occupy,\u201d he said. Bradley had to handle the demobilization of 11 million Americans \"with carbon paper and a telephone,\" Wilkie said. \"\u2026 No problem is insurmountable today.\u201dThe election results mean he \u201cexpects to answer more questions\u201d from House Democrats, but he feels confident about the spirit of bipartisanship in the congressional VA committees, he said.GOOGLE BUILDING HEALTH TEAM: The company has named Linus Upson, an engineering leader at life sciences subsidiary Verily, to be the interim head of its health team until Geisinger CEO David Feinberg takes over next year, CNBC reported Friday.

The pharmacist in Gallup, N.M., where McAneny practices, called for the prior authorization but was denied by the health plan. Then he checked the PDMP and learned that her patient had multiple prescriptions written by McAneny and her partners. Suspecting the patient was a drug seeker, he did not notify her the prescription was denied. \u201cMy patient, a very proud man, felt shamed and didn\u2019t know what to do. So, he went home to be as tough as he felt he could be. That worked for about three days \u2026 and then he tried to kill himself.\u201d He ended up in the ER, though he survived. \"My patient nearly died of an under-dose,\u201d she said, describing the case as symptomatic of \u201cour current dysfunctional health care system.\u201d AN EHR FOR PLUMBERS: Plumbers Local 130 in Chicago recently decided to implement a Cerner EHR at a health center it\u2019s setting up for members and their families next year. \u201cLocal 130 is dedicated to building and maintaining a healthy and happy workforce, and Cerner looks forward to joining them in this important effort,\u201d said Mike Heckman, Cerner's VP for population health services.

Last year, CMS made deep cuts to Medicare lab services putting this access at risk. Unfortunately in 2019 seniors will face another round of drastic cuts to lab tests including tests for some of the most commonly diagnosed conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Recently CMS has made some changes, but those changes do not stop the next two years of double-digit cuts. Millions of beneficiaries are counting on action from Congress to ensure they have access to the lab tests they need. It\u2019s time to make sure the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) is implemented in the right way.
