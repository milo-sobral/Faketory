A midterm cycle that\u2019s already seen record numbers of female nominees for Congress is also bringing signs of a significant boost in women donating to campaigns and ample anecdotal evidence of more women engaging in grassroots activism.Story Continued BelowWomen have historically voted at higher rates than men, and it remains to be seen whether that gender gap will grow further this year as even more women turn out to vote. But Wexton, who\u2019s challenging Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in a district long held by the GOP, said she\u2019s been seeing more women participating in campaigns since last fall, when Democratic women snagged 11 of the 15 state House of Delegates seats that the party took from Republicans.\u201cIt means something to have representatives who look like the people we\u2019re here to represent,\u201d Wexton said in an interview after she and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright snapped a selfie with volunteers.Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

One Wexton volunteer, Renise Leresche, said attendance at an annual women\u2019s summit run by an activist group she works with leaped from 350 to 750 this year. The group, Network NoVA, is \u201cfor electing Democratic \u2014 hopefully, women,\u201d Leresche said. \u201cBut we have a lot of men who are involved in the efforts.\u201dCollege-educated women favor Democrats over Republicans in 69 swing House races by 27 percentage points, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll released earlier this month. And 78 percent of Democratic women reported themselves as \u201cvery motivated\u201d to vote in an average of the past three weeks of POLITICO/Morning Consult polling \u2014 greater than for Republican women (65 percent), Democratic men (72 percent) or Republican men (72 percent).Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said that while it\u2019s tough to predict whether women will turn out at higher rates, she sees women more engaged in this election \u201cthan they have been in the past. \u2026 This enthusiasm among women is not just for women candidates.\u201dThe fact that the 2018 campaign has become a referendum on President Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing first two years in office is stoking enthusiasm among the entire electorate, not just women. An average of 68 percent of women and 69 percent of men said they are \u201cvery motivated\u201d to vote. But the enthusiasm edge among Democratic women tracks with what Laurie Wolfe, 43, is seeing on the ground as a co-chair of the liberal group Indivisible\u2019s chapter in Minnesota\u2019s 3rd District.Wolfe recalled in an interview that while she is a longtime voter, she \u201cwasn\u2019t active politically before the 2016 election.\u201d Now, she added, \u201cI\u2019m leading a whole group of activists, mainly women, in our district.\u201d\nInteractivesThat effort is benefiting a male Democrat, Dean Phillips, whom polls show leading Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.). As the pollster Greenberg observed, women\u2019s high level of enthusiasm isn\u2019t just helping female candidates such as Wexton, one of a record 235 female House nominees from both parties this year.At the liberal activism network Swing Left, which focuses on routing grassroots energy into battleground races, political director Adrienne Lever said volunteers have \u201ca general understanding that it\u2019s not just about supporting women. It\u2019s [also] about supporting male candidates who are supporting women.\u201dThough no single metric can gauge female Democrats\u2019 motivation levels ahead of next week\u2019s midterms, a Swing Left survey of its members who most regularly respond to calls for phone banking, canvassing and other volunteer efforts found that 73 percent were women. It\u2019s not just volunteering that women are doing in greater numbers: The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics found in March that 31 percent of donations to House candidates were from women, a high-water mark since the group began tracking data in 2000.What pollsters won\u2019t know until after next week\u2019s votes are tallied is whether signs of heightened enthusiasm among women yield higher turnout. In the previous midterm election, in 2014, men voted for Republican House candidates by a 16-point margin, 57 percent to 41 percent, according to exit polls. Women, meanwhile, tilted blue, giving 51 percent of their votes to Democratic candidates, compared with 47 percent to Republicans.The gender gap \u2014 the difference in vote preference between men and women \u2014 could be even larger in 2018. This year, polls show men are close to evenly split between the two parties, while women go for Democrats by double-digit margins. A recent New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll of Wexton's race in Virginia found Comstock with a 2-point lead among men, 45 percent to 43 percent. But the Democrat had a 17-point lead among women, 54 percent to 37 percent.While women have historically voted at higher rates than men, the difference in turnout rates is smaller in midterm elections than in presidential years. In both the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, the turnout rate for women was 4 percentage points greater than for men. The gap between the two genders was roughly half of that, however, in the two most recent midterms: 2014 (2.2 points) and 2010 (1.6 points).\nelections\n                    By MAGGIE SEVERNS and LORRAINE WOELLERTDemocrats' advantage among college-educated women, and the signs of rising female enthusiasm for the midterms, is likely to pay off more in the House's suburban battlegrounds than in the deep-red states where five Democratic senators are struggling to hang on. In Montana, one of those states that Trump carried by double digits, Democrat Kathleen Williams recently downplayed her reliance on female voters even as she touts her aim to bring \"stateswoman-ship\" to Congress.\u201cWomen are motivated. I think men are motivated. I think young people are motivated,\" Williams, who's challenging Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) in an at-large House race that recent polls show statistically tied, said in an interview in Billings. \"That\u2019s the coalition we need: progressives, independents, moderates and Republicans.\"Still, Williams said the contrast with a GOP congressman who body-slammed a reporter last year has been beneficial to her. When Trump praised Gianforte, she recalled, she was flooded with money: \"Boy, did I get a lot of donations from across the nation.\"Burgess Everett contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?
