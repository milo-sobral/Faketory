All of the public, independent polls have shown a margin of error race with 2 points or fewer separating Abrams and Kemp, though it has typically been Kemp with a 1- or 2-point edge. The campaign also features a Libertarian, Ted Metz. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in November, there would be a runoff between the top two vote-getters in December to decide the governorship.If elected, Abrams would become the first African-American woman to serve as governor in U.S. history.The poll was conducted Oct. 14 through Oct. 18 among 864 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Among the 554 likely voters surveyed, the margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops?
