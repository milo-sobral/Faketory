Analysts cite many other explanations.\n                    By BEN WHITE10/30/2018 05:10 PM EDTPresident Donald Trump is setting up a simple strategy if markets and the economy cool over the next two years: Blame Democrats and the Fed.In recent days, Trump and his senior advisers have repeatedly argued that recent turbulence in the stock market reflects investor fear that Democrats will retake the House in the midterm elections next week. \u201cIf you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday. And he has repeatedly bashed the Federal Reserve in recent interviews for its modest campaign of rate hikes.Story Continued BelowThe Trump campaign\u2019s closing ad of the midterm cycle \u2014 using footage from the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 suggests that handing power to Democrats would bring back sky-high unemployment. \u201cI think election risk is a big part of this correction,\u201d Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t want to see an overturning of the business tax cuts or the deregulation or the energy boom. Until this is settled, it\u2019s going to be hard.\u201dEconomists and market analysts say these arguments bear little connection to reality.Instead, they note that the economy is following a pattern many predicted when Trump and Congress slashed corporate tax rates last year: a period of faster growth followed by a return to the pace of around 2 to 3 percent that has persisted for nearly a decade with annual deficits rising.Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Panic over Democratic gains in Congress does not rank high on the list of worries. \u201cMarkets aren't dumb. They can read the same polls as everybody else,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThey know that at the moment there is a very high probability that Democrats will take the House. I think from a rational market perspective, that news is pretty much in the price at this point.\"Trump once again on Tuesday attributed recent stock market declines to the Fed\u2019s campaign of rate hikes as well as fear over the midterm outlook. But the sharp decline that took place Monday afternoon directly followed a report that Trump could slap tariffs on an additional $260 billion of imports from China as soon as December. That would entail putting tariffs on just about everything the U.S. imports from China, from clothing to electronic goods. Tariffs on China currently at 10 percent are scheduled to rise to 25 percent in January unless a deal is struck. A reduction in exports in the third quarter dragged down overall economic growth by the largest amount in over three decades, adding to investor fear. Corporate earnings remain strong, but many large firms are now warning that tariffs on imports and exports threaten their long-term profits. That\u2019s left markets concerned that the U.S. economy could be headed south, though not because of the Fed or Democrats. Instead, there is more concern in the recent report showing economic growth decelerated to a still strong 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter. In that reading, capital investment was up a disappointing 0.8 percent.\nWhite House\n                    By ALEX ISENSTADT\u201cThe worry you now have is you look at GDP and you have seen quite a surprising slowdown in capital expenditure,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cMaybe this slowdown is temporary. Or maybe there is something more worrisome going on, and the trade war could expand and we could be in a situation where we may have a more extended slowdown.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments about the stock market sinking under Democrats also contradict history. In every midterm cycle since 1946, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has risen in the year after the election, regardless of the partisan outcome. So the president\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t explain what\u2019s going on in the stock market, which is now flat for 2018. In 2017, the first year of Trump\u2019s tenure, the S&P rose about 23 percent. The president prefers to date the market rise to Election Day of 2016. Since then, the S&P is up 24 percent. (In the first year of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, the market rose around 43 percent.) \u201cI don\u2019t think market volatility is all about the midterms,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Webdush Equity Management. \u201cIf we get into a four-year, slug-it-out battle with the Chinese where they wait to see if a new president comes along, that\u2019s not going to be good news.\u201dAdministration officials reject the idea that the third-quarter numbers suggest any real slowdown from the faster pace of business investment under Trump. White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett noted in an interview that capital goods orders and shipments remain strong. \u201cThe story of the tax cuts is they cut the cost of capital, which should lead to higher capital spending,\u201d he said. And Hassett rejected the idea that the economy is running on a tax-cut-infused sugar high. \u201cIf we continue to see a capital spending boom, then productivity goes up and wages go up, and you can sustain higher consumption because you increase supply. And all that can happen without causing runaway inflation.\u201d\nWhite House\n                    By QUINT FORGEYEconomists are less convinced that the third-quarter slowdown was a one-time event. \u201cIn terms of business spending, I was a bit concerned about that,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global. \u201cYou do have to say, \u2018It\u2019s one quarter, and let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019 But it\u2019s worth watching particularly what happens with equipment spending.\u201d On the Fed, economists say the central bank is doing exactly what it should be doing \u2014 especially with unemployment near historical lows, inflation running near the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target and tariffs running the risk of driving up consumer prices at a faster pace. This makes Trump\u2019s bashing of the central bank look more like scapegoating.\u201cWe have 2 percent interest rates and 2 percent inflation, so real interest rates are zero,\u201d said Shepherdson. \u201cI could quite happily make the case that they are actually a little bit behind. You can\u2019t wait until inflation pokes you in the eye before you do something about it.\u201dMissing out on the latest scoops?
