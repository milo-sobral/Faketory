Khaleel picked up figures of 3 for 13, helping India win by 224 runs.He was found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC code of conduct, for violating article 2.5, which relates to \"using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal during an international match\".Khaleel admitted to the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Chris Broad, which meant there was no need for a formal hearing. The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Ian Gould and Anil Chaudhary, third umpire Paul Wilson, and fourth umpire C Shamsuddin.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?"}
