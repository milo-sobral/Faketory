Zimbabwe could only add one more run in reply before the umpires ruled that the light was too bad, bringing an end to a day dominated by the visitors.It was Bangladesh's seventh successive sub-200 total in Tests this year. Chatara initiated the collapse by removing Imrul Kayes, the player of ODI series, who tentatively poked at a short ball away from his body and inside-edged onto the stumps.Kyle Jarvis then got into the act, getting Liton Das to drive him for four through the off-side before sucking him into another drive. However, the second one ended up being a sharp outswinging delivery that took the outside edge.Chatara then had Nazmul Hossain Shanto also playing away from his body. One ball later, Mahmudullah fell, inside-edging Chatara as the home side sunk to 19 for 4. All four wickets had resulted from bad shots.Mushfiqur and Mominul Haque added the first of four small partnerships that took Bangladesh beyond the follow-on mark, and into three figures. Mominul edged Raza to Masakadza at slip to end their 30-run stand, before Jarvis had Mushfiqur caught behind after the tea interval. Having cracked him for a four through point off the first ball of the third session, Mushfiqur poked at the next ball, another delivery that subtly left him.Mehidy Hasan then perhaps had the softest of dismissals, top edging a leg-side bound delivery from part-timer Sean Williams. Raza took his second and third wickets by removing Taijul Islam and Nazmul Islam, before Abu Jayed's run-out put an end to Bangladesh's misery.The morning session belonged to Taijul who completed a six-wicket haul. He broke through the visitors' resistance in the 12th over of the morning, though Shanto's catch played a bigger part in the dismissal. As Chakabva clipped Taijul, Shanto was looking for cover but the ball settled straight into his palms. Taijul also removed Wellington Masakadza, before picking up Jarvis and Chatara off consecutive balls.Any high the hosts may have got from the rapid end to the Zimbabwe innings, however, was quickly snuffed out.They were without their best spinner, Graeme Cremer, but two debutants and a batting allrounder more than made up for his absenceThey lost a piece of their future when they failed, agonisingly, to qualify for the World Cup.
