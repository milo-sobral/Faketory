Both men reached half-centuries. Neser made 56 while Peirson went on to 82 not out from just 106 balls before the declaration at 9 for 448.Neser made the early breakthrough with the ball with Josh Philippe bowled via an inside edge playing away from his body. Hilton Cartwright was caught at cover failing to keep his drive down before Jonathan Wells was adjudged lbw to a ball that nipped back from Mark Steketee to reduce the visitors to 3 for 42.The WA captain Mitchell Marsh and vice-captain Ashton Turner pulled the team out of the mire with a 112-run stand for the fourth wicket and looked likely to get to stumps safely. Marsh reached an important half-century to gain some confidence following a tough Test series against Pakistan in the UAE.But Turner fell two short of 50, and just three overs before stumps, slicing a drive straight to cover-point. The night-watchman David Moody was then caught at short leg off Mitchell Swepson in the next over leaving Marsh - 64 not out from 125 balls - with much work to do early on day three.The surface at Allan Border Field proved far too good to produce a result as batsmen filled their boots throughoutWill Bosisto batted throughout the third day at Allan Border Field for a career-best 132* as Western Australia moved into the leadThe Western Australia captain scored an unbeaten half-century to gain some confidence back after a poor series against Pakistan, but his team is in deep troubleQueensland enjoyed a solid opening day against Western Australia with Charlie Hemphrey continuing his good formSign up, deposit \u00a35 or more to your account and bet365 will match your qualifying deposit in Bet Credits when you place qualifying bets to the same value and they are settled.
