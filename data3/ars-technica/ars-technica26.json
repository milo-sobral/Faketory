He was Wired magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief for 12 years and then started one of the most influential companies in the brief history of consumer drones. Part one ran yesterday. If you missed it, click right here. Otherwise, you can press play on the embedded audio player, or pull up the transcript, both of which are below.Anderson met a brilliant fellow maker named Jordi Mu\u00f1oz through the online community of drone tinkerers. They became well-acquainted over the discussion forums, and he eventually invited Jordi to start a company with him. The startup was (and remains) 3D Robotics. Anderson had no idea that his cofounder was a Tijuana-based teenager\u2014and it wouldn\u2019t have bothered him in the slightest if he\u2019d known.Though 3DR eventually raised major financing, it ran and grew for years from an initial investment of just $500 worth of parts that Anderson threw into it. Everything went great for a while. 3DR\u2019s revenues eventually hit a $100 million annual run-rate\u2014and then China stepped in. Targeting a $1,500 price point with a product that cost about $850 to make, 3DR found itself up against a comparable drone made by China\u2019s DJI, which was retailing for $600.If you enjoy this installment and just can\u2019t wait for part three (which will go up on Ars tomorrow), you can find it in my podcast feed, where it first appeared on October 3rd of last year. The full archive of my episodes can be found on my site, or right in your favorite podcast app by searching for the words \u201cAfter On\u201d (the podcast\u2019s title). There you\u2019ll find deep-dive interviews with other world-class thinkers, founders, and scientists\u2014tackling subjects including robotics, cryptocurrency, astrophysics, genomics, synthetic biology, neuroscience, consciousness, privacy and government hacking, and a whole lot more.Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly mention a series of four articles that I\u2019m posting to Medium this month on the uplifting topic of existential risks. Which is to say, the grim yet perversely fascinating possibility that our technological creations might just annihilate us. I believe I present some arguments and analytic lenses that are new to this important topic, and the first piece in the series is right here.If you want to jump straight to my take on the ever-controversial topic of super AI risk (it\u2019s fine to read the pieces out of sequence), that article is here. And if you\u2019re seeking some truly sunny thoughts, don\u2019t miss my maximalist take on what lone-wolf rampage murderers might achieve if our technology gets just a little bit more awesome.I should note that Medium is running this in their editorially curated, paid, members-only section. The goods news is that Medium gives everyone access to a few articles per month with essentially zero friction.This special edition of the Ars Technicast podcast can be accessed in the following places:iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ars-technicast/id522504024?mt=2 (Might take several hours after publication to appear.)RSS:\nhttp://arstechnica.libsyn.com/rssStitcher\nhttp://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ars-technicast/the-ars-technicastLibsyn:\nhttp://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/arstechnicaYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
