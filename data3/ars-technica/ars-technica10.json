Please check out parts one, two, and three if you missed them. Otherwise, you can press play on the embedded audio player or pull up the transcript, both of which are below.The final part of the podcast is a conversation between me and podcasting superstar Tom Merritt. In it, Merritt and I discuss my interview with Harris\u2014as well as a chunk of my novel After On. This section exists because I originally thought my podcast would be a limited set of just eight episodes connected to that novel. But the podcast acquired a life of its own, and I\u2019m about to publish episode #38 in the series of eight.You may, of course, want to skip that section. Or perhaps not because it\u2019s actually a pretty fun conversation. In addition to the topics covered in my interview with Harris, Merritt and I touch on the ever-fascinating subject of tapeworms\u2014plus my own extensive background in the Middle East, my mercifully brief experiences in foster care, and more.Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly mention a series of four articles that I\u2019m posting to Medium this month on the uplifting topic of existential risk. Which is to say the grim-yet-perversely-fascinating possibility that our technological creations might just annihilate us. I believe I present some arguments and analytic lenses that are new to this important topic\u2014and some of these tie quite closely to the issues that Harris and I discuss in our conversation. The first piece in the series is right here. I should note that Medium is running this in their editorially curated, paid, members-only section. The goods news is that Medium gives everyone access to a few articles per month with essentially zero friction.This special edition of the Ars Technicast podcast can be accessed in the following places:iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ars-technicast/id522504024?mt=2 (Might take several hours after publication to appear.)RSS:\nhttp://arstechnica.libsyn.com/rssStitcher\nhttp://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ars-technicast/the-ars-technicastLibsyn:\nhttp://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/arstechnicaYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
