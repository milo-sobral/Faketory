It's the first time Apple has ever publicly demanded a retraction, according to BuzzFeed.Since Bloomberg published the exclusive article 15 days ago, a gaggle of companies, well-placed government officials, and security researchers have publicly challenged its accuracy. Apple and Amazon have said they have no knowledge of ever finding or removing servers that contained the kind of spy chips Bloomberg alleged were found in the companies\u2019 networks. Supermicro has also denied knowing anything about malicious chips being secretly implanted into any of its motherboards during the manufacturing process, as Bloomberg reported.An article BuzzFeed published on Friday said Cook is now calling on Bloomberg to retract the claims, which are solely attributed to unpublished information provided by 17 unnamed people the news service says worked for US governmental agencies and the companies that discovered and removed backdoored servers from their networks. Cook went on to issue a new round of unusually direct denials.According to BuzzFeed:\u201cI was involved in our response to this story from the beginning,\u201d said Cook.\u201cI personally talked to the Bloomberg reporters along with Bruce Sewell, who was then our general counsel. We were very clear with them that this did not happen, and answered all their questions,\u201d said Cook. \u201cEach time they brought this up to us, the story changed, and each time we investigated we found nothing.\u201d\u201cThis did not happen. There\u2019s no truth to this.\u201dIn addition to disputing the report itself, Cook also took issue with the lack of evidence he said Bloomberg supplied to document its claims. Cook said the reporters never provided Apple with any specific details about the malicious chips it is alleged to have found and removed. He added that he thinks the allegations are undergirded by \u201cvague secondhand accounts.\u201d\u201cWe turned the company upside down,\u201d Cook said. \u201cEmail searches, data center records, financial records, shipment records. We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: This did not happen. There\u2019s no truth to this.\u201dIn an email, a Bloomberg representative wrote: \u201cBloomberg Businessweek's investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews. Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies' full statements, as well as a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.\"The representative didn\u2019t answer questions asking about Bloomberg\u2019s policy on anonymous sources or if the service had plans to offer verifiable evidence in light of the unusually vigorous and detailed denials.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
