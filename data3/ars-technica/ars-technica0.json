{"id": "Hack on 8 adult websites exposes oodles of intimate user data", "paragraph": "Front page layoutSite themeSign up or login to join the discussions!\nDan Goodin\n    -  Oct 20, 2018 7:45 pm UTC\nA recent hack of eight poorly secured adult websites has exposed megabytes of personal data that could be damaging to the people who shared pictures and other highly intimate information on the online message boards. Included in the leaked file are (1) IP addresses that connected to the sites, (2) user passwords protected by a four-decade-old cryptographic scheme, (3) names, and (4) 1.2 million unique email addresses, although it\u2019s not clear how many of the addresses legitimately belonged to actual users.Robert Angelini, the owner of wifelovers.com and the seven other breached sites, told Ars on Saturday morning that, in the 21 years they operated, fewer than 107,000 people posted to them. He said he didn\u2019t know how or why the almost 98-megabyte file contained more than 12 times that many email addresses, and he hasn\u2019t had time to examine a copy of the database that he received on Friday night.Still, three days after receiving notification of the hack, Angelini finally confirmed the breach and took down the sites on early Saturday morning. A notice on the just-shuttered sites warns users to change passwords on other sites, especially if they match the passwords used on the hacked sites.\u201cWe will not be going back online unless this gets fixed, even if it means we close the doors forever,\u201d Angelini wrote in an email. It \u201cdoesn't matter if we are talking about 29,312 passwords, 77,000 passwords, or 1.2 million or the actual number, which is probably in between. And as you can see, we are starting to encourage our users to change all the passwords everywhere.\u201dBesides wifelovers.com, the other affected sites are: asiansex4u.com, bbwsex4u.com, indiansex4u.com, nudeafrica.com, nudelatins.com, nudemen.com, and wifeposter.com. The sites offer a variety of pictures that members say show their spouses. It's not clear that all of the affected spouses gave their consent to have their intimate images made available online.In many respects, the most recent breach is more limited than the hack of Ashley Madison. Where the 100GB of data exposed by the Ashley Madison hack included users\u2019 street addresses, partial payment-card numbers, and phone numbers and records of almost 10 million transactions, the newer hack doesn\u2019t involve any of those details. And even if all 1.2 million unique email addresses turn out to belong to real users, that\u2019s still considerably fewer than the 36 million dumped by Ashley Madison.Still, a quick examination of the exposed database demonstrated to me the potential damage it could inflict. Users who posted to the site were allowed to publicly link their accounts to one email address while associating a different, private email address to their accounts. A Web search of some of these private email addresses quickly returned accounts on Instagram, Amazon, and other big sites that gave the users\u2019 first and last names, geographic location, and information about hobbies, family members, and other personal details. The name one user gave wasn\u2019t his real name, but it did match usernames he used publicly on a half-dozen other sites.\u201cThis incident is a huge privacy violation, and it could be devastating for people like this guy if he\u2019s outed (or, I assume, if his wife finds out),\u201d Troy Hunt, operator of the Have I Been Pwned breach-disclosure service, told Ars.Ars worked with Hunt to confirm the breach and track down and notify the owner of the sites so he could take them down. Normally, Have I Been Pwned makes exposed email addresses available through a publicly available search engine. As was the case with the Ashley Madison disclosure, affected email addresses will be kept private. People who want to know if their address was exposed will first have to register with Have I Been Pwned and prove they have control of the email account they\u2019re inquiring about.Also concerning is the exposed password data, which is protected by a hashing algorithm so weak and obsolete that it took password cracking expert Jens Steube just seven minutes to recognize the hashing scheme and decipher a given hash.13 chars base64 usually descrypt (-m 1500 in hashcat)VTB3d1ZQYv.7o:ecotone\u2014 hashcat (@hashcat) October 18, 2018Known as Descrypt, the hash function was created in 1979 and is based on the old Data Encryption Standard. Descrypt provided improvements designed at the time to make hashes less susceptible to cracking. For instance, it added cryptographic salt to prevent identical plaintext inputs from having the same hash. It also subjected plaintext inputs to multiple iterations to increase the time and computation required to crack the outputted hashes. But by 2018 standards, Descrypt is woefully inadequate. It provides just 12 bits of salt, uses only the first eight characters of a chosen password, and suffers other more-nuanced limitations.\u201cThe algorithm is quite literally ancient by modern standards, designed 40 years ago, and fully deprecated 20 years ago,\u201d Jeremi M. Gosney, a password security expert and CEO of password-cracking firm Terahash, told Ars. \u201cIt is salted, but the salt space is very small, so there will be thousands of hashes that share the same salt, which means you\u2019re not getting the full benefit from salting.\u201dBy limiting passwords to just eight characters, Descrypt makes it nearly impossible to use strong passwords. And while the 25 iterations requires about 26 more time to crack than a password protected by the MD5 algorithm, the use of GPU-based hardware makes it easy and fast to recover the underlying plaintext, Gosney said. Manuals, such as this one, make clear Descrypt should no longer be used.The exposed hashes threaten users who may have used the same passwords to protect other accounts. As mentioned earlier, people who had accounts on any of the eight hacked websites should examine the passwords they\u2019re using on other sites to make sure they\u2019re not exposed. Have I Been Pwned has disclosed the breach here. People who want to know if their personal information was leaked should first register with the breach-notification service now.The hack underscores the risks and potential legal liability that comes from allowing personal data to accumulate over decades without regularly updating the software used to secure it. Angelini, the owner of the hacked sites, said in an email that, over the past two years, he has been involved in a dispute with a family member.\u201cShe is pretty computer savvy, and last year I required a restraining order against her,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI wonder if this was the same person\u201d who hacked the sites, he adds. Angelini, meanwhile, held out the sites as little more than hobbyist projects.\u201cFirst, we are a very small company; we do not have a lot of money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLast year, we made $22,000. I am telling you this so you know we are not in this to make a ton of money. The message board has been operating for 20 years; we try hard to operate in a legal and safe environment. At this moment, I am overwhelmed that this happened.
