It\u2019s the most important event in the board gaming calendar, where major publishers unveil their new releases, indie designers clamor to draw attention to their passion projects, and players scramble to try the hottest new games before they hit store shelves.It\u2019s a heaving, sprawling, noisy celebration of analogue gaming, and with thousands of new products on show, it\u2019s impossible to do more than scratch the surface of what\u2019s on offer. Once you set foot in the cavernous Messe Essen venue, you quickly realize that no matter how meticulously you\u2019ve planned your visit, it all counts for nothing; it\u2019s all about spotting empty spaces at demo tables and leaping at them before anyone else.Still, I managed to play a bevy of exciting new games, and along the way we discovered a few surprise favorites. Here are our highlights of Spiel 2018.Aya & Shun, Queen Games, 2 - 4 players, 45 minutes, ages 8+This fantasy-themed tile-laying game has players building chains of floating islands in the sky. You\u2019ll score points by constructing different configurations of islands, populating cities, and avoiding empty space on your player board at game\u2019s end. Standard stuff\u2014but what makes it interesting is how you go about it.You\u2019ll choose a single action to take on each turn, like adding a new land tile to your board or filling some of your islands with new inhabitants. But whatever action you choose, your opponents will immediately get to take a slightly less powerful version of the same action. It\u2019s therefore almost impossible for one player to establish an unassailable lead, and you\u2019ll need to pay close attention to your rivals\u2019 boards to spot moves that benefit you\u2014while not opening up opportunities for others.The result is that Skylands comes with just a touch more player interaction than similar games, where your only way to interfere with an opponent\u2019s plans is by snatching resources they might want. This interaction adds an extra layer to your decision making. Combined with a multitude of ways to score points, it allows for some impressive tactical depth in a family-weight game.Richard Garfield, Fantasy Flight Games, 2 players, 15 - 45 minutes, ages 12+ (publisher suggests 14+) Ars Technica\u2019s Aaron Zimmerman touched on Keyforge, the new card game from Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield, in his report from Gen Con earlier this year. But I got my hands on a set of advance review decks around a month ago, and Keyforge has quickly become one of my favorite games of 2018.Each deck contains cards from three factions, and players can only activate a single faction on each turn. This neatly sidesteps Magic\u2019s issue of \u201cmana screw,\u201d where players can be left without the resources they need to play the cards in their hand, but it still imposes interesting restrictions on what they\u2019re able to do at any given time. It makes for a succession of big, swingy, dramatic events, but never at the expense of thoughtful strategy.The big question is whether Keyforge is likely to find an audience. Are there enough players who are interested in geeky card games but don\u2019t want to get into the complexities of crafting their own decks? I hope so.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
