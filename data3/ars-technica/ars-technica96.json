Now a report from South Korea's Yonhap News Agency adds a few more details to Samsung's secretive tease.First is an actual name; according to Yonhap's sources, the phone will be called the \"Galaxy F\"\u2014presumably that's \"F\" for \"Foldable.\" The second big claim in the article is a price: $1,770 (\u20a92,000,000) for Samsung's cutting-edge smartphone. That's a big increase from the ~$1,000 flagships of today, but if this rumor pans out, the Galaxy F wouldn't even be Samsung's most expensive phone. That honor\u00a0goes to the $2,700 Samsung W2019, which, believe it or not, is a dual-screen flip phone with flagship specs and some ultra-luxury add-ons like a Samsung concierge service.According to the report, Samsung fully expects the nearly $1,800 price tag of the Galaxy F to limit sales. The company's mainstream flagship play will still be the Galaxy S10, and apparently Samsung is planning a one-two punch of the S10 in February and the Galaxy F in March.In addition to the Yonhap report, we've also been getting a few tidbits out of Google's Android developer conference last week. Google\u2014which is working closely with Samsung to make Android work on the foldable display\u2014told developers that currently, the front of the Samsung foldable has a tiny 4.58-inch display with a 1960\u00d7840 resolution, while the unfolded \"tablet\" mode has a massive 7.3-inch, 2152\u00d71536 display. Samsung tried its best to hide the design of the foldable at its announcement last week, but even with the lights turned down, you could tell that the closed front design of the phone was a lot different from the nearly all-screen designs we're used to. For whatever reason, the front has a lot of real-estate dedicated to something other than the display. It looks like Samsung certainly has a unique device on its hands.Listing image by SamsungYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
