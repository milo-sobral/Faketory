The talk focused on games across Blizzard Entertainment's portfolio\u2014along with a huge freebie from its corporate siblings at Bungie.Starting today, that developer\u2019s Destiny 2 is now free to claim on Windows 10 PCs.\u00a0Anyone who logs into Battle.net on or before November 18 can claim the game's vanilla version at this site and keep it for free. (Should you create an entirely new Battle.net account on or after November 2, you'll need to attach SMS authentication to your account to claim that copy\u2014presumably to prevent a slew of spam accounts claiming free Destiny 2 accounts.) That version includes quite a bit of content that can be played with all other owners of the PC version, though at this point, it's effectively an elaborate demo for the game's more recent\u00a0expansion packs.Blizzard's previous promises of \"multiple Diablo projects\" bore fruit during the keynote with the announcement of Diablo Immortal, a \"full-fledged action-RPG you can play everywhere with everyone.\" This game, set between the events of Diablo II and Diablo III, is credited to developer NetEase Games, a company that primarily handles online game management of Blizzard's classic series in China on top of also making its own titles. Reveal footage of the game confirmed a pretty busy interface of touchscreen buttons that mobile players will use to manage abilities and items. That interface, seen above, may look bonkers to Diablo's PC faithful, but it looks somewhat reserved compared to mega-popular mobile games like PUBG and Fortnite.Pre-registration links are already live at\u00a0Google Play, and the game's listing confirms the game's inclusion of six familiar-sounding character classes (Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, and Wizard) who can join forces in online co-op dungeon-crawling. (An iOS version of the game was also announced, though no iOS listing for the game yet exists.) Blizzard did not announce information about the game's pricing structure or release window.More cards for Hearthstone and a new shotgun-slinging cowboy hero (with a giant robot pal as its Ultimate ability) for Overwatch rounded out the biggest BlizzCon announcements. Every single feature and game announced at BlizzCon will be playable at the event\u2014\"digital ticket\" owners can also play a time-limited demo of World of WarCraft Classic\u00a0on their home computers over the next few days. (WoW Classic finally received a \"summer 2019\" release window during BlizzCon.)You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
