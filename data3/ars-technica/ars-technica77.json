Please check out parts one and two if you missed them. Otherwise, press play on the embedded player or pull up the transcript\u2014both of which are below.We open today\u2019s installment talking about the presentation Sarah made while accepting the TED prize\u2014which came with a million-dollar check to advance her work. Sarah presented in full Indiana Jones regalia, and Harrison Ford turned out to be in the audience, and a rather fun story emerges from that. On a (slightly) related note, Sarah and I also discuss an amazing VR rig the people from The VOID set up at TED that year (fittingly, with a Temple of Doom theme).Most of today\u2019s installment concerns a crowd-enabled detection project Sarah created with proceeds from the TED Prize. It\u2019s called GlobalXplorer. Partly inspired by Galaxy Zoo, it let armies of \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d scan twelve million quadrants of Peruvian satellite imagery for hints of archaeological remains. Tens of thousands of promising features were discovered. This will help the Peruvian archaeology community set its agenda over the coming decade. Sarah\u2019s longer-term goal is to rally enough volunteers to scan the entire globe over the coming decade.If you enjoyed my conversation with Sarah, please consider browsing the full archive of the After On podcast on my site. Alternatively, you can find it in your favorite podcast app simply by searching for the words \u201cAfter On.\u201d I\u2019ve posted deep-dive interviews with dozens of world-class thinkers, founders, and scientists\u2014tackling subjects like cryptocurrency, astrophysics, drones, genomics, synthetic biology, neuroscience, consciousness, privacy & government hacking, and a more.Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly mention a series of four articles that I\u2019m posting to Medium this month on the uplifting topic of existential risks. Which is to say, the grim, yet perversely fascinating possibility that our technological creations might just annihilate us. I believe I present some arguments and analytic lenses that are new to this important topic, and the first piece in the series is right here. I should note that Medium is running this in their editorially curated, paid, members-only section. The goods news is, they give everyone access to a few articles per month with essentially zero friction (and here it is, only the second of the month!).This special edition of the Ars Technicast podcast can be accessed in the following places:iTunes:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ars-technicast/id522504024?mt=2 (Might take several hours after publication to appear.)RSS:\nhttp://arstechnica.libsyn.com/rssStitcher\nhttp://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ars-technicast/the-ars-technicastLibsyn:\nhttp://directory.libsyn.com/shows/view/id/arstechnicaYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
