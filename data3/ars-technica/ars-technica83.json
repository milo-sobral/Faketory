Some reports frame the paper\u2019s findings as being about preference (preferring to wake up early or stay up late) while others frame them as being about behavior (actually waking up earlier, regardless of preference). Some hold questions of cause and effect at arm\u2019s length, while others dive right in with claims about sleep habits causing cancer.And what\u2019s the data that was used by the National Cancer Research Institute? Health News Review, in its critique of media coverage of the research, reports that researchers examined \u201cself-reported responses\u201d about being a morning person, but genetic data came into the mix, too.Between the paper, the press release, and the news, plenty of important details have started to blur. That\u2019s because the research itself is complex and multi-faceted: it used a variety of different sources of data and found fairly robust evidence of a small but meaningful link between sleep and breast cancer, but the results don\u2019t translate into easy take-home advice.The research itself comes from a paper titled \u201cInvestigating causal relationships between sleep traits and risk of breast cancer\u201d that had been made available online before it was submitted to a peer-reviewed journal\u2014a polished draft called a preprint. This means it \u201chas not gone through any formal peer-review process,\u201d said Dipender Gill, a clinical research fellow at Imperial College London,\u00a0but \u201cthe standard is generally close to that of a peer-reviewed publication.\u201d The preprint is still essentially a robust piece of scientific work, but things will likely change before it is published in its final form.Lead author Rebecca Richmond and her colleagues used genetic data, questionnaire results, and health records from nearly 400,000 women, conducting a variety of different statistical tests to explore the link between sleep and cancer. Some of those tests used women\u2019s self-reported preferences on whether they considered themselves \u201cmorning people\u201d or \u201cevening people,\" as well as data on how long they slept every day and how often they suffered insomnia. But the researchers also used genetic data, focusing on variants that have been linked to \u201cchronotype\u201d\u2014the tendency to be a night owl or morning lark\u2014and influence sleep duration and insomnia.The results showed that morning larks had a lower incidence of breast cancer. Based on the results, you could estimate that, out of 100 night owls, approximately two people would have breast cancer, compared to one person out of 100 morning fans. There was also some evidence that sleeping for longer was linked to a higher cancer risk, but this was more inconsistent across the different tests.The skeptical reader\u2019s cries of \u201ccorrelation isn\u2019t causation!\u201d notwithstanding, Richmond and colleagues were explicitly asking a causal question: does sleep affect breast cancer? In a short explainer video, Richmond\u2019s co-author, George Davey Smith, explains how the technique they used, called Mendelian randomization, is designed to answer causal questions about disease. It does so by looking at different versions of a gene that have been linked to some kind of health risk factor.For example, \u201csmokers who carry one version of a gene... tend to smoke less heavily than those who carry a different version [of the same gene],\u201d Dr. Smith explains. The gene variant itself isn\u2019t linked to shorter life spans in non-smokers, but smokers who carry the heavy-smoking version have higher rates of smoking-related diseases. So, their higher rate of smoking will be causing the higher rate of disease.The logic is that genes can\u2019t be affected by lifestyle factors or other complications: they\u2019re at the very start of the causal chain, present from the second a person is conceived. Linking the gene to the risk factor makes it possible to link the risk factor to the disease in a way that doesn't get confused by other possible influences (like smokers eating less-healthy diets).That\u2019s the concept, at least\u2014the world isn\u2019t quite so tidy. Mendelian randomization can point more strongly at causality than other methods, but it isn\u2019t incontrovertible evidence. A big problem is whether the genes in question might be associated with other factors that influence the disease. For example, what if the genes linked to chronotype are also linked to BMI and exercise levels? Or what if the chronotype genes themselves are in some way implicated in higher cancer risks?\u201cIn such a scenario,\u201d says Gill, \u201csleep patterns may be associated with risk of breast cancer but not directly cause it.\u201dResearch that explicitly sets out to answer a causal question but doesn\u2019t quite get there leaves room for a lot of confusion, especially when the press release drums home causal claims. But the other major source of confusion\u2014is this about behavior or preference?\u2014is one that has the researchers scratching their heads, too. It\u2019s not clear, they write, \u201cwhether it is the actual behavior which poses the health risk or the preference to morning versus evening.\u201dThat is, it might be the case that getting up early, regardless of how awful it feels for you, could slightly reduce your risk of breast cancer. But it could also be the case that the risk factor comes from being born a night owl, and getting up early will achieve nothing other than making you (and everyone around you) more miserable.Mornings might be more important than evenings, anyway: the researchers lay out some possible reasons for the link between sleep and cancer, and they center around exposure to light at night. Understanding how our brightly lit lives affect our health is an important direction for research to take, especially when it comes to understanding the link between shift work, disrupted sleep, and disease.There\u2019s just no take-home message here yet. The study is \u201cinformative and interesting,\u201d says Gill. But \u201cpeople should not be changing their sleep patterns based on the evidence presented here.\u201dYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
