Courtesy of our friends at TechBargains, we have another round of deals to share. Today's list is highlighted by a new set of deals on Amazon's Fire tablets.All three of Amazon's primary slates are on sale: the entry-level Fire 7 and larger Fire HD 10 are down 20-percent to $40 and $120, respectively, while the mid-tier Fire HD 8 is down 25-percent to $60. Of those, the Fire HD 8 is probably the best buy for most: that HD display is a big step up from the dirt-cheap panel on the Fire 7, but, at $60, it's still plenty affordable for a tablet that's really best suited for casual Web browsing, video viewing, and generally tossing around the house. But the Fire HD 10 is still decent if you need the bigger display, and it's worth noting that the \"Kids Edition\" models\u00a0of these devices are all currently discounted as well.We also have an all-time low on the 128GB variant of Samsung's EVO Select microSD card, a $600 discount on a recommended configuration of Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop (an Ars favorite), a nice deal on an Amazon Echo Dot and Tile Bluetooth tracker bundle, and much more.
