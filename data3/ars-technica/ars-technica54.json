The new \"space gray\" device boasts five times the performance of its predecessor, with either four- or six-core processors and up to 64GB of RAM, making it a much more capable system for demanding users.The new system looks like it will address many of those concerns. In addition to the significant processor upgrade, it includes a T2 security chip, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and optional 10-gigabit Ethernet.The better specs do come with one downside: the entry level price has gone up. The 3.6GHz i3 with 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD base spec costs $799, compared to the $499 of the previous model. At the high end, you can get a 3.2GHz (4.6GHz turbo) 6-core i7 with 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD, and 10gigE.Orders open today, and the machine will ship November 7th.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
