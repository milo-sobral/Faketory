The new permit, the DMV says, \"allows the company to test a fleet of about three dozen test vehicles without drivers behind the wheel.\"While Waymo is the first such company to get this type of permit, the DMV also noted that 60 manufacturers have licenses that allow them to operate with \"safety drivers.\"According to the company, its permit allows \"day and night testing on city streets, rural roads, and highways with posted speed limits of up to 65 miles per hour.\"\"If a Waymo vehicle comes across a situation it doesn't understand, it does what any good driver would do: comes to a safe stop until it does understand how to proceed,\" Waymo continued in a press release. \"For our cars, that means following well-established protocols, which include contacting Waymo fleet and rider support for help in resolving the issue.\"If you see or interact with a driverless car in Silicon Valley or elsewhere, we'd love to know.
