The assessment was based on a variety of evidence that not only implicated the institute, which in Russian is abbreviated as CNIIHM, but also a specific professor who works there. Evidence linking the CNIIHM to the attack\u2014which FireEye now calls TEMP.Veles\u2014included malware that was tested inside the institute, artifacts left inside the malware used in the attack, an IP address belonging to CNIIHM, and the malware developer\u2019s operating hours, which showed them observing a normal work schedule in Moscow.FireEye never identified the Middle Eastern critical infrastructure facility that was attacked, but CyberScoop in January reported it was a petrochemical plant located in Saudi Arabia.According to Tuesday's report:During our investigation of TEMP.Veles activity, we found multiple unique tools that the group deployed in the target environment. Some of these same tools, identified by hash, were evaluated in a malware testing environment by a single user.Malware Testing Environment Tied to TEMP.VelesWe identified a malware testing environment that we assess with high confidence was used to refine some TEMP.Veles tools.Testing, Malware Artifacts, and Malicious Activity Suggests Tie to CNIIHMMultiple factors suggest that this activity is Russian in origin and associated with CNIIHM.When the December report was disclosed, it already underscored an unsettling escalation in hacks on industrial control systems used in power plants, gas refineries, and other types of critical infrastructure. Now that FireEye is saying it was carried out with invaluable support from a Russian-owned institute, the stakes could be higher still. Russia has already been blamed for attacks in December 2015 and December 2016 on Ukrainian power facilities that caused power outages during one of the coldest months in Eastern Europe.On Twitter, Robert M. Lee, an expert on critical infrastructure attacks at Dragos Security, praised the FireEye research even as he cautioned against relying on it too much.Their analysts obviously put a lot of work into it and used their language very carefully. I am not trying to give confirmation to or detract from it - only want to give a kudos to what was well done research\u2014 Robert M. Lee (@RobertMLee) October 23, 2018\u201cThe @DragosInc team avoids attribution as it\u2019s an inherently political topic and our view is it doesn\u2019t help our customers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been asked about @FireEye\u2019s analysis released on TRITON attribution today. I found their analysis to be thorough and very professional. Good job.\u201dYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
