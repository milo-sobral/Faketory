But that doesn't mean there aren't some companies bucking the trend by going\u00a0smaller, not bigger. Earlier this week, we heard that Palm's brand is rebooting with a very small phone that's not meant to be your main portable computing device. But this phone from\u00a0Kyocera is even smaller.The KY-O1L has a 2.8-inch ePaper display\u2014the same technology found in a some e-readers. The handset measures at just\u00a091mm\u00d755mm\u00d75.3mm and weighs 47g. The Palm phone measures at 96.6mm\u00d750.6mm\u00d77.4mm, and a credit card is typically only 0.76mm thick. For comparison, the iPhone XS and XS Max are\u00a0143.6mm\u00d770.9mm\u00d77.7mm and 157.5mm\u00d777.4mm\u00d77.7mm, respectively.\u00a0Japanese carrier\u00a0NTT Docomo, which will release the KY-O1L, claims it is the world's thinnest smartphone.\"Smartphone\" feels like a little bit of a stretch. The KY-O1L doesn't run iOS or Android, and it has no app store. It also has no camera. It has built-in apps, though, including a Web browser, a calculator, and a calendar\u2014so sure, it's technically a smartphone. It has a 380mAh battery, which sounds abysmal, but the ePaper display should not use very much power, so we wouldn't be surprised if its battery life is just fine regardless.The KY-O1L will launch in Japan on NTT Docomo in late November for \u00a532,000, or roughly $285 at current exchange rates. Frankly, that's a bit pricy for what's included; the Palm phone will have significantly more features for $350.But the design of the KY-O1L makes the case that sometimes a phone doesn't have to be a universal computing device intended to run every aspect of your life, from health to productivity to music to work. Sometimes, it can just be a phone with a couple of extras\u2014as was the norm not so long ago. And there are some intriguing designs to explore if consumers are willing to consider the narrower value proposition.Listing image by KyoceraYou must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
