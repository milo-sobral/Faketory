Uber conducted an internal investigation, formally reprimanded him in late 2017, reduced his bonus, and had him attend sensitivity training. However, several months later, Poetzscher was promoted anyway.Uber did not respond to Ars\u2019 request for comment on Tuesday.Poetzscher was alleged to have made sexual remarks about his female colleagues and also had a consensual affair with another woman at the company against company policy, the newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources.\"I deeply regret and have learned from this error in judgment, and I am proud of how hard everyone at Uber is working to ensure our company is a positive, respectful, and inspiring place to work,\" he told the newspaper in a September 2018 statement.Poetzscher\u2019s name came up a few times during the Waymo v.

Back in October 2014, the company ran ads in France with scantily clad women that prompted public rebuke in some corners. That same year, Kalanick was profiled in GQ (which, like Ars Technica, is a Conde Nast property) and caused ire with a joke involving the term \"Boob-er.\"Since Monday, Poetzscher has changed his status on LinkedIn to \"on the beach.\"You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
