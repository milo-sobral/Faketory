{"id": "Report: Cheaper, disc-free Xbox One option coming next year", "paragraph": "Front page layoutSite themeSign up or login to join the discussions!\nKyle Orland\n    -  Nov 16, 2018 9:10 pm UTC\nMicrosoft is planning to release a disc-free version of the Xbox One as early as next spring, according to an unsourced report from author Brad Sams of Thurrott.com (who has been reliable with early Xbox-related information in the past).The report suggests the disc-free version of the system would not replace the existing Xbox One hardware, and it would instead represent \"the lowest possible price for the Xbox One S console.\" Sams says that price could come in at $199 \"or lower,\" a significant reduction from the system's current $299 starting price (but not as compelling compared to $199 deals for the Xbox One and PS4 planned for Black Friday this year). Buyers will also be able to add a subscription to the Xbox Games Pass program for as little as $1, according to Sams.For players who already have games on disc, Sams says Microsoft will offer a \"disc to digital\" program in association with participating publishers. Players will be able to take their discs into participating retailers (including Microsoft Stores) and trade them in for a \"digital entitlement\" that can be applied to their Xbox Live account.The idea of a low-cost, download-focused system also meshes well with Microsoft's recently announced All Access program, which gives users free Xbox One hardware with a two-year subscription to Xbox Live and Xbox Games Pass. In both cases, the thrust seems to be toward reducing the entry-level cost for accessing a vast digital library of Xbox games, including backward-compatible titles from older console generations.The prevalence\u00a0of and market for purely downloadable console games has certainly increased since 2013, when a Gamestop survey found 60 percent of customers wouldn't buy a system that didn't play used games. More recently, a full 50 percent of initial sales for Destiny 2 on consoles came via download instead of disc, suggesting the transition away from physical media may have reached a tipping point. It has now been more than six years since EA said\u00a0it expects to become a \"100 percent digital company\" in the future\u00a0and that the eventual\u00a0end of retail games sales is \"inevitable.\"Here at Ars, we publicly mulled the pros and cons of a console without physical media back in 2015\u00a0and again just last year. While the market might not be ready for an entirely disc-free console platform just yet, having\u00a0lower-cost, disc-free hardware as an option might just be an idea whose time has come.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
