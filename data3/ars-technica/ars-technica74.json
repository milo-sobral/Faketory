He was 84 years old.As the story goes, when Segale came to Arakawa to demand payment for a late rent bill, inspiration struck.While the broad strokes of Segale's role in Mario's naming remain consistent, the particulars can change with the retelling. David Sheff's seminal Nintendo history Game Over suggests the executives exclaimed \"Super Mario!\" after Segale's visit in 1981 (though the book misspells his name \"Segali\"). As Benj Edwards notes in an in-depth 2010 exploration of the tale, though, the \"Super\" descriptor for the character wouldn't become common until the release of Super Mario Bros. in 1985. Other retellings over the years go so far as to suggest that the \"Super\" came from Segale's role as \"superintendent\" of the building, but these stories offer little in the way of direct evidence.In any case, as The Seattle Times obituary notes, Segale \"always ducked the notoriety [for being Mario's namesake] and wanted to be known instead for what he accomplished in his life,\" such as building a successful construction business from a single dump truck bought after high school in 1952. A 1993 Seattle Times article quotes him as joking, \"You might say I\u2019m still waiting for my royalty checks,\" seemingly the only on-the-record comment on his ancillary role in Nintendo's history.Segale is survived by his wife Donna, four children, and nine grandchildren.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
