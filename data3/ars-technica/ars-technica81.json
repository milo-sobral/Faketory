So, it remains unclear how the global community can come to agreement as to what speech would be allowed.The French government has also proposed a \"Paris Call,\" which features a list of supporting companies, organizations, and national governments, ranging from Estonia to the United Arab Emirates. The United States is not on the list.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone emailed Ars to say that this was not an \"'embed' program.\"He continued:It's a pilot program of a more structured engagement with the French government so that both sides can better understand the other's challenges in dealing with the issue of hate speech online. The program will allow a team of regulators, chosen by the Elys\u00e9e, to familiarize [itself] with the tools and processes set up by Facebook to fight against hate speech. The working group will not be based in one location but will travel to different Facebook facilities around the world, with likely visits to Dublin and California. The purpose of this program is to enable regulators to better understand Facebook's tools and policies to combat hate speech and, for Facebook, to better understand the needs of regulators.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
