{"id": "Netflix is canceling Marvel's 'Luke Cage'", "paragraph": "By Kendall Trammell, CNNUpdated 5:24 AM ET, Mon October 22, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)First it was \"Iron Fist.\" Now it's \"Luke Cage.\"A lot memories. A lot of individual thank you calls to make. Just want to say thank you to Marvel, Netflix, the best Writer's room, cast, crew, the Midnight Hour, all those who graced the stage at Harlem's Paradise and the most incredible fan base in the world. Forward always...So wait... First they cancel Iron Fist after a massive improvement. Now they've cancelled arguably their best Marvel series?!I swear to God, we'd better hear something about a Heroes for Hire series like, YESTERDAY. #LukeCageLuke Cage was one of the greatest Superhero shows we have ever had. It had a quality, tone and point of view unlike anything we had seen in genre storytelling. Nothing can replace it. Just a tragedy losing this great show. #LukeCage Art by DizEvez pic.twitter.com/KfgL0AFK25I'm not into @Marvel movies or the universe. I was into #LukeCage which played like a modern Syfy allegory. Of all content on Netflix they cut Luke Cage in its prime. I hope they solicit other networks & platforms to continue. @cheo_coker is a great writer; Mike Colter is \"Luke\"Welp. That makes half of 'em.#LukeCage #IronFist pic.twitter.com/VGk904e1u4#Defenders is also dead guys... $10 Says JJ is next\u00a9\u00a02018\u00a0Cable\u00a0News\u00a0Network.
