{"id": "The Scientific Reason Why You Can't Stop Eating Halloween Candy", "paragraph": "A bowl of Halloween candy is enough to frighten any healthy eater. After just one piece, it can feel impossible to stop\u2014until you get a stomachache.You might assume that sugar is the sole reason that Halloween candy is so hard to resist. After all, it can activate reward circuits in the brain that also light up in response to drugs like cocaine, and it is possible to build up a tolerance to and dependence on sugar.But Halloween candy\u2019s hold on you goes beyond sugar alone. \u201cYou can just keep unwrapping and popping those little suckers,\u201d says Rachele Pojednic, an assistant professor of nutrition at Simmons University. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t happen if you walked into an office and there was a bowl of white sugar on the table.\u201dIt\u2019s the convergence of sugar, fat and salt\u2014the trifecta of many candies, Halloween and otherwise\u2014that \u201creally revs up the hedonic eating system,\u201d Pojednic says, referring to the well-documented phenomenon of eating for pleasure rather than physical need. Studies have shown that sweet or fatty foods can activate pathways in the brain associated with pleasure and reward, kicking off processes that can compete with or override signals that regulate normal hunger and satiety, sometimes causing people to overeat out of pleasure, not hunger. And while salt, sugar and fat are all tasty on their own, food scientists\u2014and food companies, as noted in a 2013 book aptly titled Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us\u2014have long known they become irresistible when they come together.The hedonic effect may even transcend a candy bar\u2019s ingredients, Pojednic says. \u201cWe have these really complex neurologic systems where learning and memory and pleasure all come together,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s why when you walk into the office and you see that Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup, your mouth literally starts watering. You will automatically start salivating, because you have this memory of pleasure, so that cycle sort of continues.\u201dAny palatable food can spur this effect, but something like Halloween candy, which is often linked to nostalgia and positive memories, is likely to trigger an even more intense reaction. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had experiences with food where there\u2019s this really wonderful memory around it, and we have this pleasure memory that goes along with it,\u201d Pojednic says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just pleasure from the taste or the smell of it, but also the situation that goes along with it.\u201dIt can be difficult to outsmart these bodily mechanisms, though some research suggests that consistently choosing healthful foods can eventually rewire your brain to prefer them. Until that happens, Pojednic says mindful eating is the best way to avoid an accidental candy binge. Next time you\u2019re faced with a mountain of bite-sized chocolate bars, slow down and take a minute to ask yourself, \u201c\u2018Do I actually want and need this?'\u201d Pojednic suggests. \u201cPartly it\u2019s recognizing that cue, which is so hard-wired.\u201dBut don\u2019t beat yourself up if you do give in to temptation, Pojednic says. \u201cThere are moments and times when giving yourself a treat is a really fun and awesome idea, and there are other times when you have to have a little more mindfulness around why you\u2019re feeling the way you\u2019re feeling,\u201d Pojednic says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to suppress those feelings. There\u2019s absolutely room for it in day-to-day life.\u201dWrite to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com."}
