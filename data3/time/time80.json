{"id": "Judge Tells Florida Candidates to 'Ramp Down the Rhetoric' After President Trump Claims Illegal Activity in Recount", "paragraph": "(FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.) \u2014 A judge on Monday told lawyers representing the warring sides in the Florida recount that they need to \u201cramp down the rhetoric\u201d after Republicans, including President Donald Trump, alleged illegal activity, because the unsubstantiated accusations are eroding confidence in the election for Senate and governor.The state\u2019s law enforcement arm and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing, but lawyers for the Republican party and the GOP candidates joined with Trump in alleging that irregularities, unethical behavior and fraud have taken place since the polls closed last week.\u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible\u201d in Florida, Trump declared Monday, without elaborating. He demanded that the election night results \u2014 which showed the Republicans leading based upon incomplete ballot counts\u2014 be used to determine the winner.The recount that is underway is mandated by state law.Trump went on to allege that \u201cnew ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged\u201d and that \u201cballots (are) massively infected.\u201d It was unclear what he was referring to.The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018Much of the Republicans\u2019 ire was centered on Broward County and its Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, a Democrat who was appointed in 2003 by then-Republican governor Jeb Bush. She has been re-elected four times. Critics have suggested the slow pace of ballot-counting in Broward reflects wrongdoing.Broward elections officials have said this year\u2019s count was encumbered by the unexpectedly high turnout for a midterm election and the unusual length of this year\u2019s ballots, which contained 12 state constitutional amendment proposals, partly as a result of a constitutional revision commission that meets once every 20 years.Bush said Monday on Twitter that Snipes should be removed from office, saying there was \u201cno question\u201d that she \u201cfailed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments came just hours before Broward Chief Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter held an emergency hearing on a request by lawyers for Republican Gov. Rick Scott, whose lead in the Senate race over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has narrowed with the counting of provisional and other ballots. They asked for additional sheriff\u2019s deputies to be sent to Snipes\u2019 office to monitor ballots and voting machines. The lawyers requested that the deputies be present when the ballots and voting machines are not being used and until the recount is over.State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.Once the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered. All 67 counties are facing a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to finish their recounts, and two-thirds have already begun.In their request, Scott\u2019s lawyers alleged that Snipes was engaging in \u201csuspect and unlawful vote counting practices\u201d that violate state law and that she might \u201cdestroy evidence of any errors, accidents or unlawful conduct.\u201d The motion was supported by lawyers representing the state Republican Party and opposed by Snipes\u2019 office, Nelson\u2019s campaign and the state Democratic Party.\u201cI am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric,\u201d Tuter said.\u201cIf someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\u201dAfter Tuter told all sides to meet to discuss a compromise, they agreed to add three deputies to the elections office in Broward.During the hearing, Scott lawyer Jason Zimmerman argued that Snipes has a long history of election errors and irregularities. He said the only goal of the request was to \u201cprotect the integrity of the vote.\u201d\u201cThis is not about voter suppression. This is not about stopping this vote. This is not about, as Sen. Nelson\u2019s campaign said, about intimidation,\u201d Zimmerman said.Snipes\u2019 lawyer, Eugene Pettis, said that Zimmerman\u2019s goal in filing the motion was to \u201cundermine\u201d the public faith\u2019s in the election in case Nelson overcomes his deficit and wins the recount.He said Snipes\u2019 office already has deputies, security guards and cameras guarding the ballots, and the recount process is conducted in view of four representatives each from the Republicans and Democrats.Bipartisan experts agree that voter fraud is a rare phenomenon across the nation.To be sure, Broward County has experienced glitches with tabulation machines and mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. Still, officials said there was nothing illegal happening.That didn\u2019t stop protests outside Snipes\u2019 office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot.In Palm Beach County, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said Monday that it would \u201calmost impossible\u201d for her county to meet the Thursday deadline because of outdated laws and outdated equipment certified by the state.The recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, continued without incident.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
