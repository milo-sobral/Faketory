{"id": "Matthew Whitaker's Appointment Is the First Big Test for House Democrats", "paragraph": "Democratic lawmakers won\u2019t be sworn in until Jan. 3, but they\u2019re already facing the first test of their new House majority: the future of oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe.After President Donald Trump announced he was appointing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, key Democratic lawmakers swung into action, sending letters to Administration officials demanding answers and requesting that documents be preserved related to the decision.It was the sort of thing they\u2019d done a lot while in the minority, but now those letters come with the veiled threat that they may force officials to testify publicly or subpoena documents that aren\u2019t provided voluntarily when the new session of Congress starts Jan. 3.Those questions include why Trump fired former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, how Trump chose Whitaker and whether ethics officers advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller\u2019s probe due to negative comments he\u2019s made in the past and ties to a key witness.Already, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned Democrats that aggressive oversight could amount to \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d a phrase Trump picked up on Monday to blame them for a stock drop that was actually caused by traders\u2019 concerns of an imminent economic slowdown amid rising trade tensions.The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018In an interview Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reiterated that Democratic use of subpoena power would be \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d and not \u201cscatter-shot.\u201dWithin minutes of Trump\u2019s tweet that he had chosen Whitaker, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who is poised to lead the House Judiciary Committee, tweeted that Democrats would hold the president accountable for the decision. That night,Nadler, along with Reps. Elijah Cumming and Adam Schiff \u2014 the likely heads of the oversight and intelligence committees \u2014 and long-serving Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent a letter to top administration officials demanding that they preserve all documents related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe and the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.When Pelosi convened all members of the Democratic caucus, both current and incoming, on a conference call last Thursday to discuss Sessions\u2019 termination, Nadler emphasized that Democrats are prepared to hit the ground running and get to the bottom of what had happened; those letters, he told Democrats, were to designed to put the administration on notice.On Sunday, top Democrats sent another letter to Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, the Justice Department\u2019s ethics officer, asking if he or other ethics officials had advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation.Before Whitaker joined the Justice Department as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, he had argued that Mueller was close to overstepping his boundaries, and tweeted that an article referring to the probe as a lynch mob was \u201cworth a read.\u201d Whitaker also chaired Sam Clovis\u2019 campaign for Iowa state treasurer in 2014; Clovis, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s national co-chairman during the 2016 campaign, has publicly confirmed he was questioned by Mueller.His attorney has also said he was the unnamed \u201ccampaign supervisor\u201d mentioned in court documents for George Papadapoulos, who pleaded guilty last fall to making false statements to the FBI.The next step will start in January after the new Democrat majority takes office. If Nadler or other committee chairs want to question Whitaker about why he won\u2019t recuse himself from the Russia probe, they can summon him to testify. If he doesn\u2019t comply, they can subpoena him. They may not be able to force a recusal from the Russia probe or handpick Sessions\u2019 permanent replacement, but they can hold Whitaker\u2019s feet to the fire and make sure the public knows about it \u2014 changing the power dynamic in Washington, where Trump has been able to dominate cable news with his tweets and actions.Appearing on the Sunday talk shows for their first victory lap since their victory in the midterms, leading Democrats appeared ready to seize on this dynamic.\u201cIf [Whitaker] doesn\u2019t recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he\u2019s doing anything to interfere with the probe,\u201d Schiff told NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday.\u201cMr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer. And any role that he plays will be exposed to the public.\u201dWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com."}
