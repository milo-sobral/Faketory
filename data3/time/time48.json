One only needs look so far as last year, when Queen Bey channeled the original Queen Bee, Lil\u2019 Kim with not only one but five of the female rapper\u2019s most iconic looks. Suffice it to say, Queen Bey reigns supreme on this spooky holiday and Halloween 2018 is no exception.Beyonc\u00e9 brought the heat in a leather jacket, white tank top, and gold chain-belted high-waisted denim, which she paired with a dark brown pixie-style wig to transform into soulful R&B legend, Toni Braxton as she appeared on her eponymous 1993 album. To finish off the look, Beyonc\u00e9 accessorized with a red lip and gold jewelry. The Lemonade singer showed off her clever costume in a trio of Instagram posts that riffed on the graphics of Braxton\u2019s album, including the design of the album\u2019s first single, \u201cAnother Sad Love Song.\u201dBust she wasn\u2019t done. Early Thursday morning, Beyonce channeled Olympians for a second costume. She dressed as superstar sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner, a.k.a. Flo-Jo, while Jay Z appeared to pay tribute to track and field wonder, Tommie Smith, number 307 and his historic political moment.See Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2018 Halloween costumes, and take a look back at her best looks from past years below.Write to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com."}
