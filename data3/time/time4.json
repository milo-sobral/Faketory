{"id": "Angela Merkel and Other European Leaders Press for Facts About Jamal Khashoggi's Death", "paragraph": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel led a chorus of European leaders pressing Saudi Arabia to come clean about how and why government critic Jamal Khashoggi was killed.While U.S. President Donald Trump called the Saudi response and admission that Khashoggi was killed at its consulate in Istanbul a \u201cgood first step,\u201d Merkel portrayed the \u201chorrific events\u201d surrounding his killing as a warning that democratic freedoms are under assault across the globe.\u201cThey still haven\u2019t been cleared up and of course we demand that they be cleared up,\u201d Merkel told a regional convention of her Christian Democratic Union party in eastern Germany on Saturday.Her stance was echoed across the region. The European Union demanded the investigation be carried out with more transparency, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he was unconvinced by Saudi Arabia\u2019s account that Khashoggi died during \u201can argument\u201d in the consulate, while France called the incident out as a murder and condemned it with \u201cthe utmost firmness.\u201d\u201cThe fact that the Saudis last night confirmed that he died, after previously insisting he left the consulate alive, shows that we haven\u2019t been told the full truth, and we must insist on getting that,\u201d Rasmussen said in Copenhagen after talks with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte.Rutte and Rasmussen said they would back an investigation into the journalist\u2019s death by the United Nations and other Western powers.In Washington, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee noted that the Senate has demanded a probe by the U.S. government. He said in a statement that the Saudis \u201ccan undergo their own investigation, but the U.S. administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\u201dFormer FBI Director James Comey weighed in on Twitter and blasted both the president and the Republican Party.The United States should be a shining light for the world, modeling a democracy that values truth, respects free press, protects human rights, and stands against murderers, oppression, and bigotry.  Trump and the Republican Party are dimming that light.\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) October 20, 2018Merkel, who grew up under communism in what was then East Germany, mentioned Khashoggi\u2019s killing after evoking the legacy of the East German pro-democracy uprising that toppled the Berlin Wall in 1989.\u201cYet globally, these freedoms are anything but self-evident,\u201d she said.With the EU under attack from populists, Merkel told her party\u2019s delegates in the state of Thuringia that the CDU\u2019s task is to stand up to nationalist forces that want to break up or weaken the European Union, including in next year\u2019s European Parliament elections.\u201cWe see how others are trying to breach taboos, say things openly, throw everything into question,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must never allow that. Thoughts turn to words, words turn into action and that leads to violence.\u201dContact us at editors@time.com."}
