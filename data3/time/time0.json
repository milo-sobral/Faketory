{"id": "Amy Schumer Will Refuse Super Bowl Ads in Support of Colin Kaepernick", "paragraph": "Comedian Amy Schumer said Friday she would not do a Super Bowl commercial this year, in support of ex-quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Her message came the same day reports surfaced that singer Rihanna turned down being the next year's Super Bowl half time performer, also in support of Kaepernick.Schumer posted the message to her Instagram, saying she believes more white NFL players should kneel during the national anthem to show their support of their black teammates. Taking a knee has become the main form of protest in the NFL against police brutality and racial injustice in the U.S. Friday thought. I wonder why more white players aren\u2019t kneeling. Once you witness the truly deep inequality and endless racism people of color face in our country, not to mention the police brutality and murders. Why not kneel next to your brothers? Otherwise how are you not complicit? I think it would be cool if @maroon5 backed out of super bowl like @badgalriri Did. I personally told my reps I wouldn\u2019t do a Super Bowl commercial this year. I know it must sound like a privilege ass sacrifice but it\u2019s all i got. Hitting the nfl with the advertisers is the only way to really hurt them. I know opposing the nfl is like opposing the nra. Very tough, but don\u2019t you want to be proud of how you\u2019re living? Stand up for your brothers and sisters of color. And the hottest thing a guy can do is get down on one knee. Not to propose but to reject the treatment of his teammates by this country. Anyone who says its disrespectful to our military please read up on the fact that a lot of veterans are proud of what @kaepernick7 is doing and fully support him. What are your thoughts?A post shared by @ amyschumer on Oct 19, 2018 at 8:11am PDT\"I personally told my reps I wouldn't do a Super Bowl commercial this year,\" Schumer wrote. \"I know it must sound like a privilege-ass sacrifice, but it's all I got.

His actions have enraged many, including President Trump. This has led Kaepernick, who is currently an unsigned free agent, to claim he has been blacklisted by NFL leadership.Schumer has taken more public political action recently, including getting arrested with Emily Ratajkowski earlier this month while protesting the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.In her Instagram post, she did not specify whether she had been offered any Super Bowl advertising opportunities."}
