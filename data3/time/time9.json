{"id": "Afghanistan's Long-Overdue Parliamentary Elections Reach a Chaotic End", "paragraph": "(KABUL, Afghanistan) \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s parliamentary elections, already three years overdue, ended as chaotically as they began with even the Independent Election Commission uncertain of how many of the estimated 21,000 polling stations closed by 4 p.m. local time, the original closing time.There were a multitude of attacks but the most serious was in a northern Kabul neighborhood where a suicide bomber blew himself up just as polling was about to end, killing three people and wounding another 20, many of them seriously, said Dr. Esa Hashemi, a physician at the nearby Afghan Hospital.Police and Interior Ministry officials say 15 people were killed and wounded in that attack. Among the dead are several police officers, said Najib Danish, a ministry spokesman.Stakes were high in these elections for Afghans, who hoped to reform Parliament, challenging the dominance of warlords and the politically corrupt and replacing them with a younger, more educated generation of politicians. Likewise, for the U.S., which is still seeking an exit strategy after 17 years of a war there that has cost more than $900 billion and claimed more than 2,400 U.S. service personnel.As the day began Saturday, polling stations struggled with voter registration and a new biometric system aimed at stemming fraud, but that instead created enormous confusion because many of those trained on the system did not show up for work. Also, the biometric machines were received just a month before polls and there was no time to do field testing.\u201cThe widespread reports today of confusion and incompetence in the administration of the elections \u2026 suggest that bureaucratic failures and lack of political will to prioritize organizing credible parliamentary elections may do more to delegitimize the election results than threats and violent attacks by the Taliban and Daesh,\u201d said Andrew Wilder, vice-president of Asia Programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, using the Arabic acronym name for the Islamic State group.Polling was extended until 8 p.m. local time for all those polling stations that opened late, with many opening as much as five hours behind schedule. Polling stations that could not open before 1 p.m. local time will open Sunday for voting.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani marked his ballot at the start of voting. In a televised speech afterward, he congratulated Afghans on another election and praised the security forces, particularly the air force, for getting ballots to Afghanistan\u2019s remotest corners.\u201cI thank you from the bottom of my heart,\u201d he said, also reminding those elected that they are there to serve the people and ensure the rule of law.The chaos surrounding the elections, however, threatens to compromise the credibility of polls which an independent monitoring group said were also marred by incidences of ballot stuffing and intimidation by armed men affiliated with candidates in 19 of the country\u2019s 32 provinces.North of Kabul, thousands of outraged voters blocked a road after waiting more than five hours for a polling station to open, said Mohammad Azim, the governor of Qarabagh district where the demonstration took place.Election Commission Commissioner Abdul Badi Sayat said dozens of teachers who had been trained in the new biometric system had not shown up for work at the polling stations. It wasn\u2019t clear whether that was related to a Taliban warning directed specifically at teachers and students telling them to stay away from the polls.\u201cThe long lines at many polling stations today, despite the threats and violent attacks by the Taliban and Daesh, clearly demonstrate that the problem with Afghan elections is not the enthusiasm of Afghan voters for a democratic future,\u201d said Wilder.Afghanistan\u2019s deputy chief executive Mohammad Mohaqiq expressed outrage at the chaotic start to polling and assailed election preparation by the country\u2019s election commission.\u201cThe people rushed like a flood to the polling stations, but the election commission employees were not present, and in some cases they were there but there were no electoral materials and in most cases the biometric systems was not working,\u201d he said.The Defense Ministry said it had increased its deployment of National Security Forces to 70,000 from the original 50,000 to protect the country\u2019s 21,000 polling stations.Elections in the two provinces of Kandahar and Ghazni have been delayed as well as in 11 of the country\u2019s nearly 400 districts.The Independent Election Commission registered 8.8. million people. Wasima Badghisy, a commission member, called voters \u201cvery, very brave\u201d and said a turnout of 5 million would be a success.At a polling station in crowded west Kabul, Khoda Baksh said he arrived nearly two hours early to cast his vote, dismissing Taliban threats of violence.\u201cWe don\u2019t care about their threats. The Taliban are threatening us all the time,\u201d said 55-year-old Baksh, who said he wanted to see a new generation of politicians take power in Afghanistan\u2019s 249-seat Parliament. He bemoaned the current Parliament dominated by warlords and corrupt elite. \u201cThey have done zero for us.\u201dIn the run-up to the elections, two candidates were killed while polling in Kandahar was delayed for a week after a rogue guard gunned down the powerful provincial police chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq. In the capital of Kabul, security was tight, with police and military personnel stopping vehicles at dozens of checkpoints throughout the congested city.Commission deputy spokesman Aziz Ibrahimi said results of Saturday\u2019s voting will not be released before mid-November and final results will not be out until later in December.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
