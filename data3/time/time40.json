{"id": "Can Beto O'Rourke Win? Texas Democrats Hold Their Breath", "paragraph": "Jason Kile is the kind of voter who makes Democrats optimistic that they can win the Senate seat here. The 45-year-old business analyst took an almost-eight-hour road trip to pick up his two children attending Texas A&M and his third at the University of Texas-Austin so that the family could vote together for Democratic nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m setting an example for my kids,\u201d said Kile as he stood in line here near Dallas to get a picture with O\u2019Rourke, a three-term House member who has come close to becoming the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Texas since 1994 \u2014 a record dry-spell in the nation.There is definitely something sizzling in Texas. O\u2019Rourke is an impressive candidate who is hustling for every vote. He has campaigned in every one of Texas\u2019 254 counties, is raising cash quicker than he can spend it and is drawing so many newcomers into politics that pollsters from both parties concede that their models could be scrambled by folks who typically didn\u2019t consume political news, let alone make it.Yet, in conversations with more than 40 Texans over three days in and around Dallas, it\u2019s not clear anyone actually thinks O\u2019Rourke can win. The typical response to the question \u201cCan Beto win?\u201d is crossed fingers or a Catholic sign of the cross.\u201cI would like to think so,\u201d 61-year-old retired teacher Emily Barmer said as she stood outside an early voting location in DeSoto. \u201cI thought he had a chance, but I keep seeing the polls. Down 6, down 8 points.\u201dThat\u2019s the rub. O\u2019Rourke is drawing huge crowds and comparisons to other Democratic stars. \u201cHe\u2019s Kennedyesque,\u201d said 73-year-old Dan Keough, who saw both John and Bobby Kennedy campaign in the 1960s. Separately, 38-year-old Demethius Jackson made a more recent analogy: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much momentum since the Obama election.\u201dBut there has yet to be a poll showing him ahead of Cruz. Headwinds are aplenty in Texas for Democrats, despite hundreds of grassroots events that spring up across the state to organize voters in support of O\u2019Rourke. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019re trying to make something happen,\u201d said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. \u201cBeto has out-raised anybody we\u2019ve ever run. We\u2019re pleased about that and we hope it will help him pass. \u2026 Even if he doesn\u2019t win, we\u2019ve made real progress if we can get these young people interested in voting.\u201dSome O\u2019Rourke fans and critics alike claim \u2014 despite the candidate\u2019s consistent insistence otherwise \u2014 that he will be seeking the presidency in 2020, win or lose. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if he doesn\u2019t\u201d win, said Jonnie England, whose car sports two \u201cBeto\u201d stickers and another urging her neighbors to \u201cRESIST.\u201d The O\u2019Rourke campaign is the first she\u2019s volunteered for in 40 years and she spends much of her time promoting the candidate as a straight-shooter who can most the country past politics. \u201cI\u2019ll be deeply saddened [if O\u2019Rourke loses], but there\u2019s 2020 right around the corner. He says he doesn\u2019t want to run, but minds can be changed.\u201dThe ding on O\u2019Rourke, of course, is that he is the most over-hyped candidate of the cycle. He is drawing enthusiastic and genuine crowds. He has raised a record $38 million in the third quarter of this year. And his speeches, often delivered at the expense of his vocal cords, border on Obama-caliber aspirations. \u201cHe is the great hope of Texas,\u201d says Candice Quarles, a city councilwoman in DeSoto.Still, O\u2019Rourke is running in Texas, a state that has tempted Democrats in the past to think they have a chance, only to see devastating losses. \u201cIt appears to me to be this term\u2019s iteration of Democrats\u2019 great hope. Four years ago, it was Wendy Davis and she was going to be the start of a blue wave and she wasn\u2019t. This time, it appears to be Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s turn to be this term\u2019s Wendy Davis,\u201d says James Dickey, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for Texas voters to vote against Republican elected officials.\u201dDavis, in 2014, drew similar optimism about her odds, but still captured just 38% in her bid for Governor. And despite being a rather matte candidate, Cruz fits the bill for many Texans, especially when it comes to immigration and communities of faith. His role in confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is a selling point for self-described Christian conservatives and evangelicals, and Trump\u2019s decision to hold a rally in support of Cruz helped, too. At the same time, Trump has a net negative approval rating in Texas.Yet, there are signs that maybe, if the stars align, O\u2019Rourke could pull this off. \u201cEveryone I know is on Team Beto,\u201d says Machelle Allums, a 59-year-old who works in insurance. \u201cIf the elections are fair, he\u2019s got this.\u201d Voters under the age of 30 have been showing up at early voting centers at rates five-fold over where they were in 2014, the last non-presidential campaign year. Republican enclaves in the state are seeing \u201cBeto\u201d signs in neighbors\u2019 yards \u2014 and in neighborhoods outside of Texas, too.\u201cBeto has so much support. He\u2019s changing politics for the better,\u201d said Linda Unger, a 63-year-old Dallas woman. \u201cThat support might not be all in Texas, though.\u201d Write to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com."}
