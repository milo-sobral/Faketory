{"id": "'Fear is the Coward\u2019s Way of Leadership.\u2019 Michelle Obama Tells Oprah Why She\u2019s Hopeful About America", "paragraph": "After two terms serving alongside her husband Barack Obama in the White House, Michelle Obama found herself with a little free time on her hands. The former First Lady isn\u2019t one for idle hands, apparently, and used her new free time to write a memoir, Becoming. In advance of her highly-anticipated book hitting store shelves on November 13, she sat down with none other than Oprah Winfrey for an interview.The duo had a wide-ranging conversation for Elle magazine where they covered everything from Obama conquering her fears of making her private life public in the book, her over-achieving childhood, what she and Barack learned in couples counseling, and the simple pleasure of making cheese toast on your own.She also discussed the so-called birther conspiracy, stoked by Donald Trump, that her husband was not born in the U.S.A. and was thus ineligible to be president, for which she says she will \u201cnever forgive him.\u201d Obama told Winfrey, \u201cIt was reckless, it put my family in danger, and it wasn\u2019t true. And he knew it wasn\u2019t true.\u201dPerhaps most striking in these divisive times, though, is Obama\u2019s ongoing optimism about the state of the nation. She is still hopeful in the future of America. \u201cWe have to feel that optimism. For the kids. We\u2019re setting the table for them, and we can\u2019t hand them crap. We have to hand them hope,\u201d Obama says in the interview. \u201cProgress isn\u2019t made through fear. We\u2019re experiencing that right now. Fear is the coward\u2019s way of leadership. But kids are born into this world with a sense of hope and optimism. No matter where they\u2019re from. Or how tough their stories are. They think they can be anything because we tell them that. So we have a responsibility to be optimistic. And to operate in the world in that way.\u201d\u00a0Contact us at editors@time.com."}
