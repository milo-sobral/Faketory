{"id": "The Catholic Church Has a Version of Pok\u00e9mon Go Just for Catching Saints", "paragraph": "Get out there and get evangelizing! At least, that\u2019s the latest word from the Catholic church after an associated organization launched a new app \u2014 called \u201cFollow JC Go\u201d (JC, presumably, stands for \u201cJesus Christ\u201d) \u2014 to get the faithful involved in religious activity on their smartphones.Taking its cues from the popular augmented reality Pok\u00e9mon Go game, in which players try to \u201ccatch\u201d creatures like Pikachu through the GPS-enabled interface, Follow JC Go helps users discover biblical figures and icons \u2014 literally, saints, represented in stylized cartoon form \u2014 as they wander around cities. They\u2019ll interact with the virtual holy characters and add them to an \u201cevangelization team,\u201d as long as they answer certain questions right that refer to biblical history. Gameifying religion: just the next offering put-upon Catholic church. A promotional video suggests that players can win points and compete against friends, gather \u201ce-teams\u201d of believers and even find nearby churches and \u201cmake the journey more fun\u201d by playing.The app was developed and launched by the Foundation Ramon Pane, with the intention of getting younger people involved in evangelizing. And they even got the blessing of the Pope himself with the project.\u201cYou know, Francis is not a very technological person, but he was in awe, he understood the idea, what we were trying to do: combine technology with evangelization,\u201d said Ricardo Grzona, the executive director of the foundation, to religious news outlet Crux Now. \u201cNever has the Church had a project like this. This is the Catholic app with the most advanced technology there is.\u201d First launched in Spanish, they have plans to expand the language options to include English, Italian and Portuguese in the coming weeks. It\u2019s free and available for both iOS and Android \u2014 because the church apparently welcomes players of any operating system. While it has a 3.8 star rating so far on the App Store, reviews so far are inconclusive.Write to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com."}
