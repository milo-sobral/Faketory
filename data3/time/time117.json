The Saudi government has denied the claim.The conclusion will bolster efforts in Congress to further punish the close U.S. ally for the killing. The Trump administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.The U.S. official familiar with the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke only condition of anonymity Friday. The conclusion was first reported by The Washington Post.Saudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat has said the crown prince had \u201cabsolutely\u201d nothing to do with the killing.Vice President Mike Pence told reporters traveling with him at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua New Guinea that he could not comment on \u201cclassified information.\u201d He said Saturday \u201cthe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press, and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder.\u201dThe United States will \u201cfollow the facts,\u201d Pence said, while trying to find a way of preserving a \u201cstrong and historic partnership\u201d with Saudi Arabia.Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was a columnist for the Post and often criticized the royal family. He was killed Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.This past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.Among those targeted for sanctions were Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate, and Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince\u2019s entourage on trips abroad.The sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.Also this past week, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing. The prosecutor\u2019s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom\u2019s leadership, primarily the crown prince.President Donald Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \u201cthe cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\u201dBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.The Post, citing unnamed sources, also reported that U.S. intelligence agencies reviewed a phone call that the prince\u2019s brother, Khalid bin Salman, had with Khashoggi. The newspaper said the prince\u2019s brother, who is the current Saudi ambassador to the United States, told Khashoggi he would be safe in going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents he needed to get married.The newspaper said it was not known whether the ambassador knew Khashoggi would be killed. But it said he made the call at the direction the crown prince, and the call was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.Fatimah Baeshen, a spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, said that claim was false.She said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that the ambassador met Khashoggi in person once in late September 2017. After that, they communicated via text messages, she said. The last text message the ambassador sent to Khashoggi was on Oct. 26, 2017, she said.Baeshen said the ambassador did not discuss with Khashoggi \u201canything related to going to Turkey.\u201d\u201cAmbassador Prince Khalid bin Salman has never had any phone conversations with him,\u201d she said.\u201cYou are welcome to check the phone records and cell phone content to corroborate this \u2014 in which case, you would have to request it from Turkish authorities,\u201d Baeshen said, adding that Saudi prosecutors have checked the phone records numerous times to no avail.The ambassador himself tweeted: \u201cThe last contact I had with Mr. Khashoggi was via text on Oct. 26, 2017. I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the U.S. government to release any information regarding this claim.\u201dContact us at editors@time.com."}
