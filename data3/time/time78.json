I could always look to the President to know he is going to say and do the right things.\u201dFoxx said he feels the President rips the nation apart instead of healing.\u201cSay the economy is doing a little better, but you rip us apart so we can\u2019t even have a conversation right now, that\u2019s the disheartening part,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think, not only do we vote, but we put pressure on the people who are supposed to be doing it. What can you do to actually heal it a little bit?\u201dFoxx added that he wished the Democrats would come together.\u201cDemocrats are like R&B singers, they gotta sing lead,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never saw Obama with Clinton, they never came together if you think about it. You had all of these opportunities to come together. I remember when Obama won, I thought it would be great if Obama, Bill Clinton and all of the Democrats did a nice cover for TIME magazine. No. Republicans, they sing in a choir, they don\u2019t necessarily sing in tune but they sing loud and they all know the words.\u201dWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@timeinc.com."}
