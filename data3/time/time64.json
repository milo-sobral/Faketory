{"id": "Jewish Nurse Who Treated Suspected Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooter: 'I Chose to Show Him Empathy'", "paragraph": "(PITTSBURGH) \u2014 A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man\u2019s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.\u201cI\u2019m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,\u201d registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.Mahler described his role as \u201cThe Jewish Nurse\u201d who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that \u201cI just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn\u2019t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word to him about my religion,\u201d Mahler said in the post . \u201cI chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.\u201dAn Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital\u2019s emergency department March 1, said he didn\u2019t see evil in Bowers\u2019 eyes but \u201ca clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him \u201cfor saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.\u201dHe noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who \u201cinstilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.\u201dMahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism \u201ca lot\u201d as a kid, said he acted out of love.\u201cLove. That\u2019s why I did it,\u201d he said. \u201cLove as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here. \u2026 I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.\u201dContact us at editors@time.com."}
