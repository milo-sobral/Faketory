{"id": "New York State Sues Exxon Mobil for Misleading Investors Regarding Climate Change", "paragraph": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 A few months ago lawyers for Exxon Mobil Corp. stood before a judge and told New York\u2019s attorney general to \u201cput up or shut up\u201d after investigating the company\u2019s public disclosures about climate change, saying it should sue the company or move on. Today, New York chose the former.The state\u2019s Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the energy giant in state court in Manhattan, accusing it of misleading investors about how future regulations could impact the company\u2019s finances. The suit culminated an almost three-year-long investigation that reached the highest levels of Exxon\u2019s leadership.\u201cExxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations,\u201d Underwood said in a statement.Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.The Irving, Texas-based company in March lost a lawsuit in which it sought to have the investigation stopped. Exxon has long argued the case was politically motivated, having been coordinated behind the scenes with other Democratic-led states and environmental groups hostile to oil producer.The state in June accused Exxon of failing to comply with subpoenas for cash-flow projections reflecting how it used so-called proxy costs to calculate the financial impact on its assets from future regulations.New York said it wants to know exactly how the proxy cost for greenhouse gas emissions has been used in making investment decisions, corporate planning reviews, reserves estimates and evaluations for more than two dozen assets and projects.In August, at a hearing about the state\u2019s subpoenas, Exxon\u2019s lawyer Theodore Wells complained that the state\u2019s investigation had dragged on for too long.\u201cThey should put up or shut up,\u201d he told Justice Barry Ostrager. The judge agreed, saying the case \u201ccannot go on interminably.\u201dManisha Sheth, a lawyer in Underwood\u2019s office, responded at the time that the state\u2019s investigators had \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
