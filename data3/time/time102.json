{"id": "Bill Maher Targets Stan Lee's Legacy in Controversial New Blog Post", "paragraph": "Comedian Bill Maher has come under fire for a blog post where he suggests comic book readers are immature and targets Stan Lee, just days after his death.Maher\u2019s thoughts on comic book culture were posted on his Real Time with Bill Maher blog on Saturday. He seems to equate comics with arrested development in American culture and bemoans adults who love \u201ckid stuff.\u201d The post \u201cAdulting\u201d comes less than a week after Stan Lee died at age 95. Lee was a comic-book writer behind some of Marvel Comics\u2019 most iconic superheroes.\u201cThe guy who created Spider-Man and the Hulk has died, and America is in mourning. Deep, deep mourning for a man who inspired millions to, I don\u2019t know, watch a movie, I guess,\u201d Maher wrote. \u201cThe assumption everyone had back [when I was a kid], both the adults and the kids, was that comics were for kids, and when you grew up you moved on to big-boy books without the pictures.\u201dMaher writes that some time in the last 20 years \u201cadults decided they didn\u2019t have to give up kid stuff\u201d and \u201cpretended comic books were actually sophisticated literature.\u201dMaher capped off this blog post by claiming that comic books haven\u2019t made people any \u201cstupider\u201d but that we\u2019re now \u201cusing our smarts on stupid stuff.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge stretch to suggest that Donald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important.\u201d he wrote.Maher\u2019s comments about Lee and comic book fans, just days after the legend\u2019s passing, did not sit well with many.SBill Maher dismissed an entire storytelling medium?Wow. He's so highbrow.His brow is so high, there's probably less room for a mind.\u2014 Tom Taylor (@TomTaylorMade) November 17, 2018It's crazy to me that Bill Maher is using Stan Lee's death to insult the maturity of comic book fans. It's crazily out of character for him to try to assert his intellectual superiority over the ignorant masses in a shrill, strident, obnoxious and attention-seeking way.\u2014 Nathan Rabin (@nathanrabin) November 17, 2018The fact that the only way Bill Maher can score heat anymore is saying Stan Lee is responsible for Donald Trump should inspire some introspection in that dude about how pathetic he is now. But if that was possible, he wouldn't be Bill Maher\u2014 Nathan Bernhardt (@jonbernhardt) November 17, 2018Bill Maher use to be my idol. To draw in Stan Lee on a point that he made was sick. One who decides to diss one's stance on make believe that enforces the greater want to achieve a better world is like the bully who says Santa is fake. We all know but let one hope. Hope is rare.\u2014 Jessica \ud83d\udc4a\ud83e\udd18 (@reneejess0205) November 17, 2018\u00a0Write to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@timeinc.com."}
