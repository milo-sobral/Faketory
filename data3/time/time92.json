{"id": "The New 'Grinch' Movie Is Hiding a Taylor Swift Meme in Plain Sight", "paragraph": "Goats are having a moment this holiday season.Specifically, a goat in the new animated The Grinch movie, which just topped weekend box office sales. In the retelling of the classic Christmastime story, the furry green star goes on a journey into the woods \u2014 and encounters a goat on his escapade as an extra \u201clayer of fun,\u201d according to an interview between co-director Scott Mosier and INSIDER. That\u2019s because it isn\u2019t just any goat, but a screaming goat, inspired by the Taylor Swift \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d remix video that went viral in 2013.\u201cI wish I could say it was some deep, artistic, creative core, but it was YouTube,\u201d Mosier said.The screaming goat video was a hit online when the surprisingly anthropomorphic sound of the animal was spliced in to Swift\u2019s song and music video from her 2012 album Red, taking the place of her vocals in the dubstep track\u2019s chorus. Strange, yes, but also strangely effective, the random mashup between human and animal was a popular meme at the time \u2014 and has apparently remained top-of-mind enough to make its way into the production process of the Grinch crew while they were developing the gags for the new movie. Just goes to show: the Swift effect has a long reach.Write to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com."}
