I love you.\u201dRogers addressed the crowd after Rabbi Aaron Bisno put on a sweater in homage to her husband, who was known for rarely ever being without one. The past week has seen numerous people invoke quotes from Fred Rogers, who made his home in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the shooting occurred.\u201cThis is literally Mr. Rogers\u2019 neighborhood,\u201d was a common refrain among those in Squirrel Hill as people tried to square the pain and terror caused by the shooting with the fact that a man who so embodied kindness had lived there for so long.While addressing congregants, Joanne Rogers said she also was facing difficulty wrapping her head around the shooting.\u201cIt\u2019s been confusing for me. I\u2019ve been frightened,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had trouble dealing with the fact that this happened, I don\u2019t want to give credit to the fact that it happened.\u201dWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com."}
