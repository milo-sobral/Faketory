{"id": "Secretary Pompeo Defends Sanction Waivers for Iranian Oil Purchases", "paragraph": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Secretary of State Michael Pompeo defended the temporary waivers granted to eight countries to continue buying Iranian crude oil for now against Congressional critics and others who say the U.S. is being too lenient on the Islamic Republic.The comments on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d come a day before U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy and shipping are due to snap back following President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement.\u201cThe president\u2019s policy of maximum pressure will be fully in place come tomorrow,\u201d Pompeo said during the interview. \u201cWatch the Iranians. That\u2019s who really understand the importance and the impact of the effort that we\u2019re undertaking.\u201dPompeo said the U.S. moves have \u201chad an enormous impact already.\u201d Iranian crude oil exports have already been reduced by over 1 million barrels a day and will continue to fall, he added.Pompeo wouldn\u2019t say if India and China are receiving waivers, or if they\u2019d delivered commitments to stop their buying. Bloomberg reported on Nov. 2 that India, Japan and South Korea are among those approved, and that China is in discussions on terms but is among the eight, according to two people familiar with the discussions.The waivers are aimed at countries that \u201cneed a little bit more time\u201d to get their purchases down to zero, Pompeo said, a comment consistent one made on Friday, when he said waivers were being given to importers who\u2019ve made \u201cimportant moves\u201d toward shunning Iranian oil.The pressure group United Against Nuclear Iran, led in part by former Senator Joe Lieberman, lashed about the waivers, tweeting on Friday that the administration had \u201ccaved.\u201dWidespread waivers granted under Iran sanctions. Whatever happened to maximum pressure? They caved. Big time. https://t.co/7AwO0hLH8W\u2014 UANI (@UANI) November 2, 2018Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida also took issue with the waivers.\u201cSanctions waivers being given to key purchasers of Iranian oil, most alarmingly China, give Iran a financial reprieve, and should be eliminated as soon as possible,\u201d Rubio said in a press release on Friday. Cruz said it was important that \u201cfinal policy imposes maximum pressure\u201d on Tehran.Pompeo rejected the criticism.\u201cNo one\u2019s going to argue that Secretary Pompeo is not tough on Iran,\u201d Pompeo said on Fox, pushing back against those who want further sanctions on Iranian banking by saying that \u201cthe Iranian banks that engage in sanction able behavior will be sanctioned by the Department of Treasury.\u201dIn a separate interview on Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Pompeo said hundreds of businesses have left Iran since Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, and any European companies doing business there won\u2019t do business with the U.S.\u201cThe whole world understands that these sanctions are real,\u201d Pompeo said.On Friday, Trump said in a statement that the U.S. remains open to reaching a \u201cnew, more comprehensive deal\u201d with Iran that blocks its nuclear-weapons program, saying Tehran faces a choice between \u201cits destructive behavior\u201d or \u201ceconomic disaster.\u201dThe administration\u2019s strategy is to punish Iran so severely that it\u2019s compelled to negotiate a permanent end to its nuclear ambitions, as well as what the U.S. calls its \u201cmalign behavior\u201d in the Middle East. In granting waivers, Washington is trying to ensure that global oil prices don\u2019t spike, especially in the middle of the U.S. election season.Asked on CBS whether Iran could restart its nuclear program, Pompeo said, \u201cWe\u2019re confident that the Iranians will not make that decision.\u201dPompeo also said economic sanctions on North Korea won\u2019t be lifted until the country completely ends its nuclear program in a verifiable fashion.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
