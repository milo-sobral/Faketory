{"id": "Georgia's Brian Kemp Opens 'Cyber Crimes' Investigation Into State Democrats, 2 Days Before Election", "paragraph": "Georgia Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp opened an investigation into the state\u2019s Democratic Party Sunday, alleging a failed attempt to hack the Georgia voter registration system.\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\u201d Press Secretary of the Georgia Secretary of State Candice Broce said in a statement. \u201cWe can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\u201dThe Secretary of State\u2019s office opened the investigation on Saturday night and alerted the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.Two days before election day, Kemp is locked in a fiercely-contested race with Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams. If elected, Abrams will be the first-ever American black female governor.In a statement to TIME, the Abrams campaign called the investigation, \u201ca political stunt.\u201d\u201cThis is yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State,\u201d Democratic Party of Georgia Executive Director Rebecca DeHart said. \u201cTo be very clear, Brian Kemp\u2019s scurrilous claims are 100% false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp\u2019s official office released a statement this morning.\u201dAbrams called the investigation \u201cdesperate\u201d and characterized it as politically motivated in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday morning.The Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office has not released any evidence of a cyberattack or the assertion that the state Democratic Party is behind it. The Secretary of State office has not responded to TIME\u2019s request for comment.David Cross, a D.C. lawyer and partner at Morrison Foerster who is representing a group of Georgia voters in a separate lawsuit, says the Secretary of State\u2019s announcement came shortly after he alerted Georgia authorities to a vulnerability in the state\u2019s voter registration page.Cross says he was made aware of the vulnerability after a Georgia citizen made contact with his team and claimed it spurred Kemp to this investigation.\u201cWe learned of what sounds to be a very serious vulnerability with the myvoter page. We alerted the authorities, we expected the Secretary of State would take that seriously,\u201d Cross told TIME. \u201cWe were surprised to see that the apparent response to that was accusing the [Democrats] of hacking.\u201d DeHart cast the investigation as an attempt by Kemp to \u201cdeflect blame for his failures\u201d in a statement to TIME. She accused Kemp of abandoning his responsibility to protect the security of Georgia\u2019s election systems, citing his 2016 refusal to accept election security assistance from the Department of Homeland Security and his office\u2019s alleged leak of 6 million Georgians\u2019 personal information in 2017. \u201cGeorgians of all political stripes are very concerned about election security and the security of Georgians\u2019 personal information,\u201d DeHart wrote. \u201cThe Democratic Party of Georgia shares that concern, but we did not create, discover or attempt to take advantage of the deeply vulnerable system used by the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\u201dKemp and the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office have recently come under fire for what DeHart has called \u201cvoter suppression efforts,\u201d referring to Kemp\u2019s enforcement of the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d voter law.A federal judge issued an injunction against Kemp\u2019s office on Friday, ordering the Secretary of State to allow 3,141 people previously marked as ineligible to vote to cast their ballots on Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections if they present proof of citizenship to country election officials.\u201cThese individuals will suffer irreparable harm if they lose the right to vote, this harm outweighs any harm to the Defendant, and granting an injunction is in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d read the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross.In 2016, Kemp accused the Department of Homeland Security under the Obama administration of cyber attacks against Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State office. Inspector General John Roth determined last year that there was no abnormal activity from Homeland Security against Georgia.Correction, Nov. 5:The original version of this article misstated the source of a quote that said Kemp\u2019s investigation is \u201canother example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State.\u201d The person quoted is Democratic Party of Georgia Executive Director Rebecca DeHart, not Stacey Abrams campaign Press Secretary Caitlin Highland.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
