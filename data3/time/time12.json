In a Twitter post, it quoted Dewji thanking \u201cthe authorities of Tanzania, including the police force for working for my safe return.\u201dThe 43-year-old was seized by unidentified people in the Tanzanian commercial hub of Dar es Salaam on Oct. 11. It was the latest worrying turn for Tanzania, once described as an \u201cisland of peace\u201d in a turbulent region, but that has seen a recent spate of politically motivated violence.Dewji owns MeTL Group, a conglomerate operating in several African countries and contributing about 3.5 percent to Tanzania\u2019s gross domestic product, according to its website. There was no publicly announced demand for ransom; Dewji\u2019s family offered almost $500,000 as a reward for information that led to his rescue.Sirro said Saturday that an AK-47 rifle and three pistols were found in a car that was used by three kidnappers, two of whom spoke English and the other Swahili. The police are in pursuit of the men and hopeful they\u2019ll be arrested, he said, adding that Tanzania remains safe for investors.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
