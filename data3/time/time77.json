{"id": "Simone Biles Now Tied for Most Decorated Female Gymnast Ever After Winning a Fourth Gold at Worlds", "paragraph": "(DOHA, Qatar) \u2014 Simone Biles returned to training last November wondering if she could ever return to the form that made her an Olympic champion.She doesn\u2019t wonder anymore. Neither does anyone else.The American star capped a remarkable 2018 world gymnastics championships by claiming gold on floor exercise and bronze on balance beam during event finals Saturday, giving her six medals for the meet and 20 overall in the world championships, tied with Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina for the most by a female gymnast.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be proud, but I\u2019m most proud of that I\u2019m here, I made all the event finals, medaled in all of the events and I survived,\u201d Biles said.Something that wasn\u2019t a guarantee when the meet began. Biles spent the night before qualifying in the hospital dealing with pain from a kidney stone. The stone was too big to pass and she couldn\u2019t take prescription pain medication because of doping regulations, forcing her to simply deal with it.Biles did more than deal with it. She dominated. Just like always.The 21-year-old will head home to Houston with gold medals from the team final, the all-around final, floor and vault as well as silver on uneven bars and bronze on beam. She became the first woman to earn a medal on all four events since Yelena Shushunova did it for the Soviet Union in 1987.Biles believes it\u2019s just the beginning. She\u2019ll visit with doctors to treat the kidney stone, go on a short vacation and then point toward 2019.\u201cHopefully I feel more confident next year going into all of the events,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about upgrades. I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019ll see.\u201dBiles finished a busy 10 days by drilling her floor routine, which includes intricate tumbling runs that are as difficult as anything done by the men these days. Though she stepped out of bounds on her third pass, her score of 14.933 was a full point better than that of teammate Morgan Hurd, who earned her third medal of the meet by finishing with silver. Japan\u2019s Mai Murakami took third.Biles wasn\u2019t quite as crisp on beam, an event that she\u2019s struggled with recently. She wobbled during qualifying and fell off during the all-around finals. Though she managed to stay on during event finals, she found herself off balance on multiple occasions. Her score of 13.6 held up for bronze behind China\u2019s Liu Tingting and Canada\u2019s Ana Padurariu.While allowing it wasn\u2019t her best, Biles took to Twitter in between beam and floor exercise to chastise those who criticized her for not winning gold. It\u2019s a move she felt was necessary.\u201cI think it\u2019s upsetting to me whenever I see all the tweets after I do performances of how disappointed they are in me,\u201d Biles said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair because they can\u2019t set expectations on me. I have to set them for myself.\u201dAnd no one\u2019s expectations are higher. Biles took herself to task after the all-around, unhappy with a series of uncharacteristic mistakes. She vowed to redeem herself in the event finals and responded by reaching the podium on each event.\u201cI\u2019m really happy to be done,\u201d Biles said. \u201cProud of my performances here. I wish some of them would have been better but I\u2019m really proud of the outcome.\u201dSo was Hurd, who won a team gold, bronze in the all-around and silver on floor, validating her breakthrough performance at the 2017 world championships when she became an unlikely champion.\u201cOh, I wanted it so badly,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got a full set.\u201dFive-time U.S. champion and two-time Olympian Sam Mikulak picked up the first world championship medal of his career when he finished third in the high bar final behind Epke Zonderland of the Netherlands and Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura, who boosted his career medal at worlds to 21.Mikulak will settle with having just one for now.\u201cI made a statement to the world that Sam isn\u2019t some washed-out gymnast that\u2019s holding on,\u201d the 26-year-old Mikulak said. \u201cHe\u2019s here to play and he\u2019s here to get medals.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s Ri Se Gwang picked up his third world title on vault. Men\u2019s all-around champion Artur Dalaloyan earned silver, with Japan\u2019s Kenzo Shirai taking bronze. China\u2019s Zou Jingyuan captured gold on parallel bars with a score of 16.433 \u2014 the highest on any apparatus by a man during the meet \u2014 while Oleg Verniaiev took silver and Dalaloyan bronze.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
