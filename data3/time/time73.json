{"id": "Trump Keeps Using Fear. But Is It Helping Republicans?", "paragraph": "Throughout his political career, from his own run for president in 2016 to stumping for down-ballot Republican candidates in 2018, Donald Trump has often used fear to motivate his supporters. In Montana on Saturday, he offered a glimpse into why.\u201cI can only go for four or five minutes with that stuff,\u201d Trump told a crowd at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport of the strong economy and jobs numbers. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fixing the problem, there\u2019s no reason to go on about it for 45 minutes.\u201dLater, in Pensacola, Florida, at his second rally of the day, Trump echoed the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m looking to solve problems,\u201d he said, \u201cnot to talk to the fact that we have done a great job.\u201dAt his midterm rallies, Trump does tout Republican successes. He read the same basic script at four rallies in four different states on Nov. 2 and 3, which included mention of tax cuts, designating Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and confirming record numbers of conservative judges to federal courts, with particular mention of new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.But he spent most of his time at the rallies, each of which lasted roughly an hour, describing the hypothetical horrors of Democratic rule to the audiences. He told the crowds in West Virginia, Indiana, Montana and Florida that Democrats would enact a \u201csocialist takeover of the American healthcare system,\u201d making the United States function more like Venezuela.He put the upcoming election in these terms at his appearance in Florida: \u201cA Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime. A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.\u201d Trump paused, pleased with the slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s cute.\u201dAs it has been since the day he announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Trump\u2019s favorite issue to return to on this theme is immigration. For whatever Republican candidate he\u2019s campaigning for, he tells the crowd that the Democratic opponent wants open borders and will let undocumented immigrants and criminals pour into the country. Talking about Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, Trump said, \u201cHe wants to flood your cities with criminal aliens, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. \u2026 So when you have people camping out on your front lawn, remember Gillum.\u201dHe even suggested without evidence that Democrats had organized the migrant caravan making its way towards the United States. \u201cThey want to invite caravan after caravan, and it is a little suspicious how those caravans are started,\u201d he said. But he noted explicitly that he thinks using the caravan as a political issue will help Republicans: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing, maybe, that they did it. Did they energize our base or what?\u201dBut Trump\u2019s dark warnings about border crossings and undocumented immigrants are an uneasy match for Florida Governor Rick Scott, who appeared with Trump in Pensacola Saturday evening and hopes to unseat the Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. Hispanic voters make up 25% of Florida\u2019s population and 17% of its registered voters, and Scott has been working hard to win them over. \u201cPracticing Spanish every day is important,\u201d Scott told TIME in a recent interview. \u201cTwenty percent of those voting in this state speak Spanish.\u201d Hillary Clinton carried 62% of Latinos in Florida as the Democratic nominee for President in 2016, but local polls show Scott could be making gains.Read More: Inside the Republican Plan to Win Hispanic Voters\u2014And Battleground States\u201cDemocrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation in so many ways,\u201d Trump said in Florida. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen.\u201d The assembled crowd in the airport hangar cheered.When Scott took the stage, he didn\u2019t mention immigration at all.Many in Trump\u2019s base remain enthusiastic about the president, as evidenced by the crowds at his rallies throughout the country during his final, aggressive campaign swing ahead of Election Day. But for Republican candidates like Scott who are trying to broaden their support to counter the swelling activation on the left, Tuesday\u2019s results could reveal whether Trump bringing his message of looming problems and a militarized border to their states helped, or whether the president perhaps should have spent more than \u201cfour or five minutes,\u201d as he said, flaunting the economy and Republican accomplishments.It wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom at Trump\u2019s weekend events. He praised his supporters for being \u201cthe greatest political movement in the history of our country\u201d and promised to deliver more tax cuts, more conservative judges and to build his signature border wall.\u201cI\u2019m a happy person,\u201d Trump assured the crowd in Montana. \u201cI\u2019m a much happier person than you would believe.\u201dBut he believes talking about the problems, not the solutions, is the winning strategy.Write to Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@timeinc.com."}
