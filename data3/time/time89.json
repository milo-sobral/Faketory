{"id": "Stan Lee, Creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Hulk, Dead at 95", "paragraph": "(LOS ANGELES) \u2014 Stan Lee, the creative dynamo who revolutionized the comic book and helped make billions for Hollywood by introducing human frailties in superheroes such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk, died Monday. He was 95.Lee was declared dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee\u2019s daughter, J.C. Lee.As the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book. He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.Millions responded to the unlikely mix of realistic fantasy, and many of his characters, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and X-Men went on to become stars of blockbuster films. Recent projects he helped make possible range from the films \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d \u201dBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d to such TV series as \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D\u201d and \u201cDaredevil.\u201d Lee was recognizable to his fans \u2014 he had cameos in Marvel films and TV projects \u2014 his hair gray and his glasses slightly tinted.\u201cI think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. \u2026 I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview. \u201cWe all grew up with giants and ogres and witches. Well, you get a little bit older and you\u2019re too old to read fairy tales. But I don\u2019t think you ever outgrow your love for those kind of things, things that are bigger than life and magical and very imaginative.\u201dLee considered the comic-book medium an art form and he was prolific: By some accounts, he came up with a new comic book every day for 10 years.\u201cI wrote so many I don\u2019t even know. I wrote either hundreds or thousands of them,\u201d he told the AP in 2006.He hit his stride in the 1960s when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life.\u201cIt was like there was something in the air. I couldn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he recalled.His heroes, meanwhile, were a far cry from virtuous do-gooders such as rival DC Comics\u2019 Superman.The Fantastic Four fought with each other. Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth\u2019s atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\u201cThe beauty of Stan Lee\u2019s characters is that they were characters first and superheroes next,\u201d Jeff Kline, executive producer of the \u201cMen in Black\u201d animated television series, told The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, in 1998.Some of Lee\u2019s creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented \u201960s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.Lee scripted most of Marvel\u2019s superhero comics himself during the \u201960s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel\u2019s publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of Spider-Man were sold.\u201cHe\u2019s become our Mickey Mouse,\u201d he once said of the masked, web-crawling crusader.Lee also published several books, including \u201cThe Superhero Women\u201d in 1977 and \u201cHow to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\u201d the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.CBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.The first big-budget movie based on Lee\u2019s characters, \u201cX-Men,\u201d was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6 billion in worldwide grosses.Stanley Martin Lieber was born Dec. 28, 1922, in New York. He grew up a fan of \u201cHardy Boys\u201d adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.Within a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \u201csilly little comics\u201d and his real name would be reserved for novels.His early work largely reflected popular movies \u2014 westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.After a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production.Comics in the 1950s were the subject of Senate hearings pushed by the Comics Code Authority, which frowned on gore and characters that questioned authority. Major comic book companies adopted the code as a form of self-regulation to avoid sanctions.Lee said he was also working for a publisher who considered comics as fare only for children.\u201cOne day I said, \u2018This is insane,'\u201d Lee told the Guardian in 1979. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the same type of stories as everybody else. I wasn\u2019t taking pride in my work and I wanted to quit. But my wife said, \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you do the kind of comics you want for a change?'\u201dThe result was the first issue of \u201cThe Fantastic Four,\u201d in 1960, with the characters, plot and text from Lee and the illustrations by famed Marvel artist Jack Kirby.The characters were normal people changed into reluctant superheroes through no fault of their own.Writing in \u201cOrigins of Marvel Comics,\u201d Lee described the quartet this way: \u201cThe characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to; they\u2019d be flesh and blood, they\u2019d have their faults and foibles, they\u2019d be fallible and feisty and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 inside their colorful, costumed booties they\u2019d still have feet of clay.\u201d\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d followed in 1962 and before long, Marvel Comics was an industry behemoth.Lee knew his work was different, proudly noting that stories were drawn out over several issues not to make money but to better develop characters, situations and themes. He didn\u2019t neglect his villains, either. One, the Moleman, went bad when he was ostracized because of his appearance, Lee wrote, adding it was \u201calmost unheard of in a comic book\u201d to explain why a character was what he was.Lee\u2019s direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry\u2019s most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50 million by New World Entertainment.As sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10 million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.In 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel\u2019s one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.\u201cWith his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\u201d he said.The dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.In the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \u201cWebisodes\u201d of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.The company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn\u2019t implicated.After that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.Lee\u2019s wife and partner in nearly everything, Joan Lee, died on July 6, 2017, leaving a void that made her husband, by then in mental and physical decline, vulnerable to hangers-on who began to surround him. Lawsuits, court fights and an elder abuse investigation all emerged in the fight over who spoke for the elderly Lee.Lee is survived by his daughter, Joanie, and a younger brother who also worked in comics, Larry Lieber.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
