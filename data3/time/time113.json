{"id": "At a Peculiar Summit in Papua New Guinea, America Is Still the Odd One Out", "paragraph": "The \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy of U.S. President Donald Trump was savaged by every world leader taking the stage at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Saturday, who together launched a stern defense of free trade and condemnation of the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington.Trump\u2019s name was never mentioned, but it was no secret who was being addressed by representatives of the 21 Asia-Pacific economies. First, Malaysia\u2019s 93-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad condemned \u201ctrade wars between major economies,\u201d before Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned against \u201cthrowing up protectionist barriers.\u201d\u201cMore than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1991 in large part because of the jobs and access to affordable consumer goods that free trade has enabled,\u201d Morrison told navy suits gathered in the small theater aboard the P&O Pacific Explorer.The Trump administration has placed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to what it claims are unfair trade practices that have contributed to a $375 billion trade deficit. China has responded with $60 billion worth of its own tariffs, with the spat upsetting global supply chains and imperiling economies around the world.Russia\u2019s diminutive Prime Minister Dimitri Medevev, looking like he\u2019d walked off a Bugsy Malone set in double-breasted grey suit, then swiped at the \u201chighly unpredictable situation in the global economy\u201d and that \u201ceconomic sanctions have become an instrument of political pressure.\u201dIt was then time for Chinese President Xi Jinping to take the stage. \u201cA cold war, hot war or trade war will produce no winners,\u201d he told the crowd to hearty applause.\u201cNobody should stop people in developing countries from pursuing a better life,\u201d he added, before insisting that his signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a transnational trade and infrastructure network, \u201cwas not a trap as some people have labeled it.\u201dIn the absence of Trump, who did not travel to PNG to defend \u201cAmerica First,\u201d that job fell to Vice-President Mike Pence. \u201c\u2019America First\u2019 is not America alone,\u201d he insisted, before launching into a stinging attack on China, mocking the BRI as a \u201cConstricting Belt or One-Way Road,\u201d and warning gathered leaders \u201cdo not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty.\u201dThe drawing of lines illustrates how the South Pacific is becoming another battleground in the strategic tussle between China and the U.S. \u2014 but one complicated by the trade-reliant region\u2019s aversion to Trump\u2019s protectionism. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact also hurt many APEC economies.China has pledged some $5.9 billion on more than 200 projects in the region since 2011, according to Australian think tank the Lowy Institute, and the sight of the chief of China Construction Bank \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest lending institutions \u2014 far back in the Pacific Explorer theater\u2019s fifth row illustrates the big guns that Xi had brought along to Port Moresby, which is already awash with building sites daubed with Chinese characters.Pence, for his part, promised that a \u201chistoric initiative to transform\u201d PNG\u2019s future would be announced soon. He added an end to the trade war might be found when Xi and Trump meet at the G20 in Argentina later this month.\u201cGovernments that deny rights to their own people too often violate the rights of their neighbors,\u201d he warned the audience, citing Beijing\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. \u201cJust like America, always put your country first.\u201dWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com."}
