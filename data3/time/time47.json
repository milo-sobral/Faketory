{"id": "Inside Scott Walker's Wisconsin Survival Plan", "paragraph": "Scott Walker stood behind a fast-food counter recently, wearing two layers of latex gloves so as not to burn his fingers on the hot hamburger patties. The governor of Wisconsin picked them up, one by one, and set them on the waiting buns, reminiscing as he did so about the time in his youth when he worked the grill at McDonald\u2019s. The worst, he recalled, was when a busload of kids would show up 10 minutes before closing. \u201cYou definitely learn how to respond under pressure,\u201d he said.These days, Walker is under pressure of a different sort as he seeks a third term in office. His opponent on the ballot is Democrat Tony Evers, the three-term state superintendent of education, a nonpartisan elected office. But Walker knows his real opponent is the political environment\u2014a climate more hostile to Republicans than any he\u2019s faced before. Polls show a close race, with Evers holding a slim lead in polling averages. \u201cThe wind was at our back in 2010 and 2014; now it\u2019s in our face,\u201d a Walker adviser tells TIME. \u201cIf you put Daffy Duck on the ballot, Democrats would have a lead going into the fall.\u201dWalker is determined not to be outworked. At the restaurant, a local chain called George Webb that was giving away burgers to celebrate the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 playoff success, Walker stayed on the burger line in his blue T-shirt for more than an hour. He popped outside to take a picture with a group of fifth graders, then dove back in, even though the local media had already gotten all the photos and B-roll they could possibly need.Walker won three hard-fought elections in five years, and even his opponents credit him with a finely tuned political radar. It started pinging long before many other Republicans recognized the danger they were in. Back in January, a Democrat won a shocking landslide in a special election for a Wisconsin state Senate district that President Trump had carried by 17 percentage points. Walker sounded the alarm: \u201cA wake up call for Republicans in Wisconsin,\u201d he proclaimed. The trend continued in April, when the Democrats\u2019 favored candidate easily won a state Supreme Court election, and in June, when another Republican-held Senate seat flipped. At a time when other Republicans were complacent, Walker saw what was coming. \u201cWe are at risk of a #BlueWave in Wisconsin,\u201d he warned. The question was whether he could do anything to stop it.Walker is one of many endangered Republican governors in this election cycle, and their fate stands to have an enormous impact on the direction of policies that affect people\u2019s lives, from education to health care to roads. The GOP piled up huge state-level gains in recent wave elections and now controls 33 governorships. But of the 36 gubernatorial contests on the ballot this year, 26 are for Republican-held seats. Democrats are either favored or an even bet to flip half of those, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report\u2019s projections. Congressional gridlock will only worsen if Democrats take the House or Senate, but states could see a huge and consequential change of direction as a result of the midterms, including control over redistricting after the 2020 Census.No victory for Democrats would be quite as sweet as defeating Walker. After taking office in 2011, he quickly pushed through a slate of collective-bargaining reforms that gutted public-sector unions\u2019 power, prompting months of raucous protests and a union-backed special recall election. Walker won the recall and won his reelection in 2014, cementing his reputation as a canny politician, a national conservative celebrity and a favorite of big national donors.Buoyed by that success, Walker ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. Despite being an early favorite, he failed to catch fire, and his mild persona was no match for the Trump Show. (Walker eats a ham sandwich for lunch every day, buys his clothes at Kohl\u2019s, and recently told a group of farmers, \u201cThe only skeleton in my closet is that my mom\u2019s a Cubs fan.\u201d) He dropped out months before the primaries began and limped back to a state that seemed none too impressed. His approval rating bottomed out in the 30s, and the Republican-led legislature increasingly defied him.Walker\u2019s numbers have ticked up since then, but he\u2019s struggled at times to come up with an argument for why he deserves a third term. It\u2019s a bit of a double bind: If he boasts about all he\u2019s accomplished, he looks out of touch with voters\u2019 dissatisfactions; if he talks about problems he wants to solve, voters wonder why he didn\u2019t get around to them in the last eight years. Four former Walker cabinet secretaries have recently endorsed his opponent, who says the state has tired of the governor\u2019s divisive style.Walker\u2019s challenge, he says, is \u201cto frame the arc,\u201d convincing the electorate that one more sequel will round out the narrative. \u201cIn the third term, I\u2019m asking voters to give me the chance to finish the job,\u201d he said. His campaign has tacked toward the center, promising to expand health care and increase education funding.But after years of creating an unassailable brand as a fiscal conservative\u2014slashing government spending, lowering taxes and blasting away at Obamacare\u2014it\u2019s a tough pivot. Walker insists he\u2019ll never allow insurance companies to reject customers with preexisting conditions. But he signed onto a multi-state lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision requiring that they do so, and rejected the law\u2019s optional expansion of Medicaid. \u201cWalker is really moderating: all of a sudden he\u2019s for things he\u2019s literally suing the federal government over,\u201d says Mike Wagner, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart campaign move given the way public opinion in Wisconsin has shifted. But it\u2019s a tough argument for him to make.\u201dWalker\u2019s allies grumble that he\u2019s a victim of his own success. His aggressive economic policies, they argue, helped turn the state around, bringing unemployment down to just 3% after it spiked during the Great Recession. Now that jobs aren\u2019t an issue, voters want more government services. Evers is proposing major expansions of health care and education, an agenda Walker warns will require raising taxes, but polls show voters prefer funding government to keeping taxes down. Evers also promises to tackle the state\u2019s crumbling roads, whose cavernous ruts an independent group has dubbed \u201cScott-Holes\u201d in billboards around the state.But Walker\u2019s biggest challenge is the local and national backlash to President Donald Trump, who pulled off a narrow surprise win in Wisconsin in 2016 but is now 5 points underwater in the state, with a majority of voters disapproving of his performance. Walker shared the stage with Trump when he campaigned in the rural central part of the state in late October, but he generally avoids talking about Trump, a former rival who once boasted that he\u2019d \u201csent [Walker] packing like a little boy\u201d in the presidential primary.\u201cIt\u2019s just history,\u201d Walker said when I asked him whether Trump was dragging him down. \u201cAnytime you have an incumbent President in their first term, any of the members of that President\u2019s party are going to have a challenge.\u201d Rather than criticize Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are unpopular in the state, Walker praised Trump for holding out for a provision the state\u2019s struggling dairy industry sought in recent U.S.-Canada trade talks. Walker said he brought the issue to the President\u2019s attention, a benefit of their relationship. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have President Trump in office, our dairy farmers would continue to get nailed,\u201d he said.Democrats in Wisconsin are energized, with canvassers combing African-American neighborhoods in Milwaukee and grassroots anti-Trump groups rallying suburbanites to the polls. But they\u2019re also wary of the Walker machine, the top-flight GOP operation that helped him prevail in past contests despite high Democratic enthusiasm. The billionaire Koch brothers, early Walker fans, briefly cooled on him over a pricey 2015 stadium deal he backed, but their political organization, Americans for Prosperity, recently announced it would spend $1.8 million on ads for him in the final stretch.Still, there are signs Walker\u2019s support network isn\u2019t what it once was. After the governor finished serving hamburgers at the restaurant here, I noticed a sign for another tenant of the same strip mall: Americans for Prosperity, with its torch-shaped logo. But when I reached the storefront, it was empty. A \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign hung in the window. The door was locked.Write to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com."}
