{"id": "Why Politicians Are Texting You So Much \u2014 And It\u2019s Only the Beginning", "paragraph": "Eleni Kounalakis, a Democrat running for lieutenant governor in California, is sitting on a couch in San Francisco, introducing herself to about one voter per second. Stylus in hand, she\u2019s hosting a \u201ctext bank\u201d with volunteers and using an app called Hustle to rapid-fire her platform \u2014 along with appeals for support \u2014 straight to voters\u2019 cellphones. \u201cYou get my vote just for reaching out,\u201d one texts back. \u201cYes it\u2019s time for more women in power!\u201d writes another. A third is less receptive: \u201cPiss off you corporatist Clintonite establishment neoliberal bootlicker.\u201d Kounalakis shrugs. \u201cOpt out,\u201d she says, tapping a button that takes the person off the campaign\u2019s contact list.This is a scene playing out across America this election season, as text messages become a new favorite form of outreach for campaigns. In an era when the majority of U.S. households no longer have a landline, millions of people have cut the cord on cable TV and direct mailers are quickly recycled, texts can \u201ccut through the clutter,\u201d as one politico explains. Some voters prefer it. Others feel it\u2019s an intrusion into one of the few sacred, ad-free spaces they have left. Campaigns are used to getting some texts back that are NSFW.Like it or not, this is the future, as businesses and nonprofits start embracing texts too. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d says Daniel Souweine, CEO of a text-focused startup called Relay, \u201cbut text messaging is how people communicate.\u201d Hustle, a trailblazer in the field, worked with about 100 campaigns in 2016. This year the number \u201cwill be in the thousands\u201d by Nov. 6, says CEO Roddy Lindsay, who once worked as a data scientist at Facebook. By 2020, other insiders predict, texting may be one of the main ways campaigns reach out to voters.The databases are already being built. Among Hustle\u2019s clients are most Democratic state parties. As is the Democratic National Committee, which earlier this year purchased the cellphone numbers of 94 million registered voters. \u201cCampaigns are going to use whatever tools they have to reach people,\u201d says Souweine, whose startup is one of many that help clients send thousands of texts per hour without running afoul of anti-spam laws.The left has been particularly aggressive in adopting it, having seen texts used to great effect by Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 machine. \u201cPeer-to-peer texting,\u201d says Caitlin Mitchell, the DNC\u2019s chief mobilization officer, \u201cis a consideration of every campaign this cycle.\u201dThe appeal of the political text is multi-fold. Campaigns can start a conversation with voters without interrupting dinner. Sending a \u201ccold text\u201d is less awkward for volunteers. And while many door knocks don\u2019t get answered, texts are a fast, low-effort way to deliver a message to voters in far-flung places. At Kounalakis\u2019 text bank, about a dozen volunteers sent 10,000 texts to voters across California in less than an hour, swapping emojis with supporters as they encouraged people to vote early.But the main reason strategists think texts are so effective is the same reason many voters are upset to be receiving them: while we\u2019ve come to accept a barrage of noise in our email inboxes and social-media feeds, the text message has largely remained a medium for personal, invited communication. That\u2019s why an estimated 90% are read within three minutes of being received, according to marketing firm Mobilesquared.\u201cWith a text message, you know you\u2019re firing it right into somebody\u2019s pocket,\u201d says David Grant, a 24-year-old libertarian in Maine who has gotten several unsolicited political texts this year and is not happy about it. \u201cI will fight to the end of the earth,\u201d he says, \u201cto make sure my text messages don\u2019t become my email.\u201dThose who see the text appeal point out that some people will be annoyed no matter what form political advertising takes, whether they\u2019re complaining that phone calls are insufferable or that door-hangers waste paper. \u201cPeople would rather be communicated to in a text channel than bombarded other places,\u201d says Gerrit Lansing, cofounder of Opn Sesame, a firm helping many Republicans with their texting campaigns this year. His platform uses a list of 17 words and phrases that automatically opt people out when they respond negatively. \u201cYou can\u2019t really talk to the TV and tell [the ads] to turn off,\u201d Lansing says.The FCC has helped ensure that someone is on the other end. In order not to violate anti-spam rules, a human being must press \u201csend\u201d on every unsolicited text. By auto-filling numbers, names and messages that are scripted by campaigns, tech firms have made quick work of the rest. (And an advocacy group called the P2P Alliance is angling to get assurance from the FCC that the status quo will remain.)Susan Morgan, a resident in California\u2019s Marin County who started a chapter of the progressive group Indivisible, has been hosting text banks at her house to support a candidate halfway across the country. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat running against Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, is working with Relay to operate one of the most ambitious texting efforts this season (which is why it\u2019s easy to find kvetching about it online). There has been pushback as they\u2019ve pinged voters on his behalf. \u201cI one time got called something I had to Google,\u201d Morgan says. But they also get lots of positive responses and questions. Overall Morgan estimates that 10% of texts start a back-and-forth.The social norms around text messages are shifting in an institution-friendly direction. A 2017 survey found that 55% of teens said they\u2019d like college admissions officers to contact them via text, up from just 9% two years earlier. Even some who are initially turned off by political texts come around in the end. After Democrats used Hustle to turn out voters in Alabama\u2019s recent special election, a woman named Katonya expressed weary gratitude to volunteers who had been contacting her: \u201cThank you all for harassing me because without it I probably wouldn\u2019t have voted!!!\u201dThere is, however, a difference between a text that seeks to inform versus persuade. Debra Cleaver, founder of the nonpartisan Vote.org, has relied on texts to prod young people to register, remind voters where their polling places are and fight voter suppression by countering inaccurate information on the fly. But she says she\u2019s seen the volume of political texts go up this year and the quality go down. While some organizations carefully target their texts to people who might be interested, others use a firehose approach.As she\u2019s in the midst of expressing these concerns, her phone buzzes. It\u2019s a text that says it\u2019s from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, asking for money for unnamed \u201cconservative candidates\u201d and offering an anonymized link. \u201cAs an organization that has actively pursued this,\u201d Cleaver says, \u201cyou wonder how much longer it will be viable.\u201dVenture-capital firms have poured tens of millions into platforms like Hustle. While that\u2019s a strong vote of confidence, insiders also acknowledge that consumer outcry or a change in how the FCC interprets the law could upend the golden era of political texting just as it\u2019s getting started.Back at the text bank, one of several she\u2019ll hold between early October and Election Day, Kounalakis thanks voters for the kind words she\u2019s received and doesn\u2019t seem to sweat the others. In between texts, she says she herself has wondered how much people will put up with if text solicitation truly goes mainstream: \u201cWhat happens when people just scream \u2018Uncle\u2019 because everyone is texting them?\u201dFor now, she believes it\u2019s the most effective way to inform the most voters about her promises to fight tuition hikes and pursue equal treatment for women in the workplace. \u201cObviously it would be better if we could go door-to-door,\u201d she says. \u201cOur feeling is that this is the next best thing.\u201dWrite to Katy Steinmetz at katy.steinmetz@time.com."}
