{"id": "'Excelsior.' Celebrities Pay Tribute to Comic Book Legend Stan Lee Who Has Died at 95", "paragraph": "On Monday, the world learned of the passing of Stan Lee, the 95-year-old co-creator of many of Marvel Comics\u2018s most beloved franchises, including Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Incredible Hulk.Lee was remembered by a chorus of fans online, who thanked him for his legacy \u2014 of humanizing superheroes, creating indelible characters and, in the words of comedian Seth Rogen, \u201cmaking people who feel different realize they are special.\u201d Ryan Reynolds, Mark Hamill, Robert Downey Jr., Jamie Lee Curtis, Elon Musk and more paid tribute to Lee and his contributions to pop culture.One common phrase popping up in tributes to Lee is the term \u201cExcelsior.\u201d Even CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper used the word \u201cexcelsior\u201d in his Tweet honoring the late creative, while  Iron Man\u2018s Robert Downey Jr. hashtagged it in his post.\u201cExcelsior\u201d was Lee\u2019s catchphrase, which he used to close out his comic book columns. He once explained to an interviewer that it was \u201cone expression that they\u2019re not going to know what it means, and they won\u2019t know how to spell it,\u201d since he didn\u2019t want it to get copied by his competition. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where excelsior came from, and they never did take up on it, thank goodness,\u201d he added.Of course, it is being taken up now as a way to remember the late, great icon.Besides his work as a writer and publisher for Marvel, Lee was also known for his memorable cameos in Marvel movies, where he would pop up to play a side character, becoming a cult favorite in front of the camera as well. \u201cThey say you should never meet a childhood idol. They are wrong,\u201d Star Wars\u2018s Hamill wrote, calling Lee \u201crevolutionary.\u201dDamn\u2026 RIP Stan.
