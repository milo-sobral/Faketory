{"id": "A Crucial Senate Race in Tennessee Is Coming Down to the Wire", "paragraph": "Two years ago, Debbi Ross didn\u2019t decide who to vote for in the presidential election until she was inside the polling booth. At that point, she prayed to God to help her decide whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be a better leader for the country.\u201cI said, \u2018Help me with this because I\u2019m so torn,'\u201d the Smyrna, Tennessee, resident recalled. \u201c[Trump] was so rough \u2026 it was really hard to vote for him. But I did it.\u201dRoss doesn\u2019t regret her decision. She thinks President Trump has has made the country stronger. But this year, the grandmother of 12 made up her mind before Election Day. She\u2019ll vote for Bill Lee, the Republican gubernatorial candidate. And she\u2019s firmly behind Democrat Phil Bredesen in the state\u2019s crucial Senate contest.\u201cI really don\u2019t like Marsha at all,\u201d Ross told TIME Saturday of the Republican candidate, Rep. Marsha Blackburn. \u201cI will not be voting for her.\u201dThis is the paradox at the heart of the tightest Senate race Tennessee has seen in more than a decade. Bredesen, a former two-term governor, has made the contest in this conservative state much closer than Republicans would like. If he wins, it will be because of people like Ross: moderate or conservative white women who live in suburban areas and still support the President.The battle between Bredesen and Blackburn has reportedly become the most expensive in the state\u2019s history, with super PACs from both sides funneling millions of dollars into advertisements and voter outreach and mobilization. While Blackburn has an advantage, according to polling averages, a survey released on Friday from East Tennessee State University found that they were tied. Trump remains popular in this state, which voted for him by 26 points; A CNN poll released Nov. 1 found his approval rating at 53 percent there. But Blackburn is less so; according to that CNN poll, 53 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Bredesen, and 48 percent for Blackburn.\u201cStatewide, [Blackburn] has never carved a very popular figure,\u201d said John Geer, Dean of the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt University and political science professor. \u201cShe\u2019s not well-liked, even within Republican circles.\u201d Geer noted Tennessee Republicans have for years gravitated towards more centrist Republicans, like Sens. Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander (and Howard Baker before them), as well as Gov. Bill Haslam, who demonstrated an ability to work across the aisle \u2014 something he says Blackburn lacks.Blackburn has hitched herself to Trump, who has held two rallies in the state this cycle and is returning for a third on Sunday. But the tightness of the race may have as much, if not more, to do with Bredesen\u2019s own popularity than dissatisfaction with Blackburn or the President. Bredesen was Tennessee\u2019s Governor from 2003 to 2011, and swept every county in the state when he was reelected to the post 12 years ago. He\u2019s a moderate who supported Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings.\u201cBredesen is absolutely the best candidate they could have gotten,\u201d said Tori Venable, the state director for Americans for Prosperity, the campaign arm of the billionaire Koch brothers\u2019 political network. TIME spent the day door-knocking with Americans for Prosperity, which has poured more than $5 million into supporting Blackburn, in the Nashville suburb of Smyrna, as part of its get-out-the-vote effort. Smyrna is located in Rutherford County, which voted for Trump by 30 points in 2016. AFP isn\u2019t the only outside group backing Blackburn: the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has spent over $12 million here since Labor Day. (On the Democratic side, super PACs Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward have collectively spent over $15 million.) There will undoubtedly be voters who are dissatisfied with Trump, and like Bredesen enough to vote for him. But whether that is what will determine the race is unclear. Some voters in Smyrna did express displeasure with Trump. But that dissatisfaction didn\u2019t seem to be enough of a deterrent to vote against Blackburn. Those who were undecided seemed to be on the fence largely because of their respect for Bredesen.\u201cI\u2019m a conservative, so I lean to a more conservative record,\u201d said Jerri Simmonds, who identified herself as a housewife when she opened the door of her red-brick home in Smyrna. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t mind crossing the party line if I think the person will do a better job.\u201dSimmonds lamented the contentiousness of the race and the sniping between the candidates. But she was adamant when asked if that rhetoric could be traced to the President.\u201cAnyone that thinks Trump\u2019s brought it on is fooling themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen a climate where people are allowed to attack a sitting President so much. [President] Obama did get it bad, but nothing compared to what Trump has gotten.\u201d Write to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com."}
