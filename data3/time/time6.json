{"id": "Former Vice President Joe Biden Says President Donald Trump Is 'Shredding' American Values", "paragraph": "(ELKO, Nev.) \u2014 The values that built America \u201care being shredded by a president who\u2019s all about himself,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday as the potential 2020 White House candidate and President Donald Trump held dueling rallies in Nevada weeks before Election Day.As early voting in the pivotal state got underway, Trump appeared in rural Elko, wrapping up a swing of Western states where he campaigned for Republican candidates, while Biden was several hundred miles south in Las Vegas at a union local.Biden, whose appearance ended shortly before Trump\u2019s began, said the United States was founded \u201con an idea, the American idea, basic fundamental decency, and it\u2019s being shredded.\u201d He said values long admired by other countries helped the United States build \u201cthe great alliances in literally the history of the world\u201d over the past 70 years.\u201cBut my God, think of what\u2019s going on now,\u201d Biden said, bemoaning that those values \u201care being shredded by a president who\u2019s all about himself. It\u2019s all about Donald.\u201dBiden also called out congressional Republicans, saying that \u201cbecause of gerrymandering and unlimited spending \u2026 are in fact choosing party over their country.\u201dTrump was lending support for Dean Heller, considered the most vulnerable GOP senator on the Nov. 6 ballot as Republicans hope to retain their Senate majority.In a further sign of the state\u2019s importance in the midterms, former President Barack Obama scheduled a stop Monday in Las Vegas.He won Nevada in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the state by 2 percentage points over Trump in 2016. But during the last midterm elections in 2014, many Democrats stayed home and Republicans won key races across the state, which has a 29 percent Latino population.Trump has used his recent appearances in Montana and Arizona to try to frame the choices for voters in the upcoming election, contending Democrats are \u201ctoo extreme and too dangerous\u201d to take control of Congress. He has sought to focus on immigration as one of the defining election issues and has falsely accused Democrats of wanting \u201copen borders\u201d and encouraging illegal immigration.\u201cAnybody who votes for a Democrat now is crazy,\u201d Trump said.The country\u2019s immigration system has long vexed politicians from both parties, and Republicans themselves have torpedoed near-compromises in recent years. Yet Trump tweeted Saturday that \u201cwe could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour\u201d if Democrats \u201cwould stop being obstructionists and come together.\u201d\u201cCall me,\u201d he told the Democratic leaders in Congress, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California. It seemed reminiscent of the time last year when Trump cracked open the door of bipartisanship with those leaders, who emerged from a White House meeting to say Trump had agreed to work toward a deal on protection young immigrants. But no agreement came to pass.Trump\u2019s Nevada visit was aimed at boosting Heller, whose opponent is Rep. Jacky Rosen as Democrats push to regain control of the Senate. Republicans hold a 51-49 edge now.In a tweet before leaving Arizona, Trump called Heller \u201ca man who has become a good friend\u201d and said he needed the senator\u2019s \u201cHelp and Talent in Washington.\u201dBut Heller once had rocky relations with Trump and had returned a campaign donation from then-candidate Trump over Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. Last year, Trump threatened Heller\u2019s re-election chances when the senator held up GOP efforts to repeal the Obama-era health law. But Heller has since become an ally of the president, who has made two fundraising stops for him in Nevada this year already.Heller and Rosen held their first and only debate of the campaign on Friday. Heller accused her of making a visit to see separated families at the U.S.-Mexico border in order to stage a \u201cphoto-op,\u201d while she described Heller a \u201crubber-stamp\u201d for Trump, whose tax plan she said benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.The Biden-Trump circling of one another in the same state happened recently in Kentucky, where Biden campaigned for a Democratic congressional candidate on a Friday night and Trump held a rally the next evening.Biden said in his appearance that \u201cbasic American values are under assault\u201d and that the upcoming election was \u201cbigger than politics.\u201dTrump used his Kentucky visit to praise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for shepherding the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh through the Senate.___Associated Press writer Michelle L.
