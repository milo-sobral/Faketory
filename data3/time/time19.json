{"id": "An Anonymous Group Spent $330,000 on Facebook Ads Urging Brits to Reject Brexit Deal", "paragraph": "A group with no publicly available information about its owners has spent up to $330,000 urging Brits to reject Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, according to evidence submitted to a British government inquiry on fake news.The website, called the Mainstream Network, is the latest group to have been linked to \u201cdark ads\u201d \u2013 advertisements targeted at specific users that doesn\u2019t reveal who is paying for them.\u201cHere we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organization spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it,\u201d said Damian Collins, a lawmaker who chairs the British government\u2019s fake news inquiry.There is no guarantee that the group is British, even though its ads directly target U.K. lawmakers. \u201cThey could be a foreign state, they could be foreign individuals,\u201d Mike Harris, CEO of 89up, the group that compiled the evidence, tells TIME.\u201cThe issue is, this is a website that has absolutely no contact details on it, and it has been set up in a way that they deliberately try to disguise who\u2019s behind it,\u201d Harris said.89up, the communications agency who carried out the research, have previously worked for Best for Britain, a campaign to keep the U.K. in the E.U.Collins said Facebook knows who is behind the ad buy, but hasn\u2019t released details.The news comes the same week as Facebook pledged to crack down on \u201cdark ads.\u201d It will force advertisers to register and verify their identity by Nov. 7.The goal of the ads, 89up said, was to convince these lawmakers to reject the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal in favor of a more complete break with the European Union.Many Facebook posts paid to be shared by Mainstream Network included the words, \u201cWe voted to leave the E.U, to take back control of our money and borders. The Chequers proposal [Theresa May\u2019s proposed deal] does not deliver this.\u201dAs many as 10.9 million users may have been reached, 89up estimated.The \u201cChequers proposal\u201d refers to a British government plan to maintain significant economic and trade ties to the E.U. after Brexit. It is named after the prime minister\u2019s country estate, where the deal emerged. The proposal has proved controversial among Brits who advocate a \u201chard Bexit\u201d that would free the U.K. from all E.U. laws and requirements.The evidence provided to the government committee says the Mainstream Network appeared to be set up to target voters in the constituencies of key lawmakers who Theresa May would depend upon to get parliamentary support for her deal.89up also said the anonymous group appeared to be in breach of GDPR, an E.U. data protection law.Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com."}
