{"id": "Bloody Deer Carcasses Dumped on Cars of Somali-Americans in Minnesota", "paragraph": "(MINNEAPOLIS) \u2014 Somali and Muslim leaders expressed deep concern Saturday after a white man and his teenage son dumped bloody deer carcasses on the hoods of two cars owned by Somali-American men in the central Minnesota city of St. Cloud, and they don\u2019t believe the explanation the suspects gave to police.The victims discovered the carcasses after leaving the YMCA on Wednesday night. In a news release Friday, assistant police chief Jeff Oxton said investigators used surveillance video to track down the pair who dumped the carcasses \u2014 a 62-year-old local and his 14-year-old son. The video showed the teenager put the skinned carcasses on the cars while the father, \u201cknowing what was happening,\u201d sat in their pickup truck, said Oxton.\u201cIn a taped statement the suspects indicated that they needed to get rid of the carcasses and dumped them at that location in that manner,\u201d Oxton said. \u201cIt is not believed that the suspects knew either of the victims.\u201dOxton said there was nothing visible on or in the victims\u2019 vehicles that would have identified the race of the owners. He didn\u2019t identify the father and son or say whether they had hunted the deer themselves or where they had obtained the carcasses.Oxton said police would forward the case to the city attorney for possible charges. In Minnesota, city attorneys generally prosecute misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors, but not felonies.One of the victims and two community leaders scoffed at the suspects\u2019 claims that they merely needed to get rid of the carcasses, pointing out that they had plenty of options for disposing of them properly or could have just dumped them in the woods.\u201cPutting it on the hood is a statement,\u201d said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of statement they were trying to make and whether it was about Muslims or not. But it\u2019s making a statement.\u201dHaji Yussuf, a local Somali community organizer, said he spoke with one of the victims, Ali Abdullahi, shortly after the incident.\u201cHe was very hurt by it, but also scared,\u201d Yussuf said, adding that Abdullahi compared it to displays of swastikas and cross-burnings. He said local Somalis are concerned because it follows last month\u2019s synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh and other recent mass shootings, and that if the perpetrators are hunters, they probably have guns.\u201cDo we just let it go, or do we take it seriously before it goes to the next step?\u201d Yussuf asked.Abdullahi didn\u2019t immediately return a phone call Saturday from The Associated Press. But he told Minnesota Public Radio that he was shocked to find the carcass on the hood of his car. \u201cMy jaw dropped. I stood there transfixed, not moving,\u201d he said. He said he believes he and the other victim were intentionally targeted because they are Somali-American and that it was intended to send the message that, \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome. We don\u2019t like you.\u201dAbdullahi also said he was afraid to return to the YMCA to work out the next night.\u201cI was thinking that someone was just there to get me, especially that this was a deer hunter, and they have a rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all the shootings that I have been seeing and watching \u2014 I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m just thinking that somebody is just watching me and trying to kill me.\u201dOxton did not immediately return a call Saturday, and a dispatcher said nobody would be available to provide further information before Monday.Minnesota has the nation\u2019s largest Somali population at an estimated 57,000. As many as 10,000 of them settled in and around St. Cloud, a city of about 65,000 people about 65 miles (104 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, and they have complained of mistreatment over the years. Relations were especially tense two years ago after a young Somali man who may have been radicalized stabbed and wounded 10 people at a local shopping mall before an off-duty police officer shot and killed him.Contact us at editors@time.com."}
