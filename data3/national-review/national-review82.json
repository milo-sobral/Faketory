Chewed out, abused. But I guess that\u2019s the norm now.\u2014 Kat Timpf (@KatTimpf) November 11, 2018After arriving at the bar, Timpf became separated from her friends and found herself in conversation with a man she didn\u2019t know, who inquired about her occupation. Timpf explained that she worked at Fox News and the conversation proceeded unremarkably. A while later, Timpf was confronted by a woman, who, after hearing she worked at Fox News, became enraged and began shouting at her in a threatening manner.\u201cThis girl started going nuts on me, screaming at me to get out of the bar.\u00a0I found her very threatening,\u201d Timpf said of the woman, whom she had never met before.\u00a0She said she tried to move to another section of the large bar but the young woman followed her while continuing to scream.The woman, who was visibly intoxicated at the time, was surrounded by a large group of men and women who all stood by and laughed as she harassed Timpf and followed her around the bar. After realizing no one in the group would defend her in what might become a violent situation, Timpf was forced to flee the bar.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\u201cIt was super uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t want things to get physical,\u201d she said.It\u2019s not the first instance of politically motivated harassment Timpf has dealt with while out in Brooklyn. Last year, an unidentified man dumped a bottle of water on her head while she was preparing to speak at a local campaign event, and she was again harassed while eating at a Manhattan restaurant several months ago.\u201cThis is the third time this has happened to me, so I\u2019m just over it,\u201d she said, adding that she has no plans to limit her public exposure despite the hostility.\u201cThere have been times where I\u2019m hesitant to go out with my glasses because it makes me more recognizable. But I have to live my life, I can\u2019t let this ruin it,\u201d she said.While high-profile conservatives like Tucker Carlson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have encountered a surge in premeditated public harassment of late, Timpf said she is perplexed as to why she would be targeted, considering she doesn\u2019t fall neatly into any political identity.\u201cI\u2019m not on the left or right so I don\u2019t really understand this,\u201d she said, adding that the individuals who target her never take issue with any of her expressed opinions, but rather are reacting to her professional affiliations.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
