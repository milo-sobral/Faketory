The same poll found that Democratic mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum had 48 percent support compared with DeSantis\u2019s 43.But a second survey from Sunday, CBS News/YouGov, found that Scott and Nelson are neck and neck, tied at 46 percent support each. The same poll showed Gillum ahead of DeSantis by just one point in the gubernatorial contest, 47\u201346 percent.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.Even more intriguing are the favorability ratings CBS/YouGov found for each candidate, based on voters\u2019 assessments of the candidates\u2019 experience up to this point. Despite his extensive negative press coverage \u2014 and Gillum\u2019s increasingly outlandish attacks against him \u2014 DeSantis leads the pack with a net-positive rating of 13, with 45 percent positive and 32 percent negative.Gillum, comparatively, has the lowest rating of the four candidates, with favorable/unfavorable of 42/37. In the Senate race, Scott edges out Nelson in terms of favorability, with a 47/39 positive to negative ratio compared with Nelson\u2019s 43/36.Meanwhile, two new polls out today show the Senate race narrowing again, with Election Day just a week away. A UNF survey shows Nelson ahead of Scott by one point, and another from\u00a0USA Today/Suffolk\u00a0shows the Democrat ahead by two. The UNF poll gave Gillum a six-point lead over DeSantis, but USA Today/Suffolk\u00a0found him ahead by just a one-point margin.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
