To conservatives, the world after graduation is a big, drab building that smells of disinfectant where you spend all day doing things that need to be done while following arbitrary rules, and even if you hang around long enough to become a teacher, you still have to deal with assistant principals and school boards, and the money to pay for it all comes from the taxpayers, i.e. you.Of course, there are colleges and colleges. As the indispensable Iowahawk has pointed out:@The_Analyst Typical pundit writing about college: Swarthmore or Oberlin grad. Typical college: Cal State Bakersfield.\u2014 David Burge (@iowahawkblog) September 21, 2014And indeed, private colleges have dominated presidential higher education since the days of John Adams (Harvard). Just as matter of interest, how many presidents do you suppose have shared the great American experience of earning a bachelor\u2019s degree at a state university? (Pause here if you want to guess.)[brief intermission]Still there?\u00a0\u00a0The answer is three: Gerald Ford (Michigan), Lyndon Johnson (San Marcos State, now Texas State), and James K. Polk (North Carolina).*Now, I won\u2019t\u00a0put forth the fallacy that our president should be a regular guy or gal; a president should be outstanding, and in recent decades, outstanding students have increasingly tended to enroll in elite, highly selective institutions, or at least in small, close-knit liberal-arts colleges (or both, as with Obama). And to be sure, public colleges can be just as crazy as private ones.But there\u2019s something to be said for the leveling effect of grappling with a vast and faceless bureaucracy, sitting in cavernous classrooms with hundreds of students, and making friends from widely varying income levels and social and academic backgrounds. And it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a president, now and then, who had lived through four years of that.***************** Three early presidents went to William and Mary, which is now a state university but in the 18th and 19th centuries was private. Three other presidents went to service academies, which are public universities but not state universities.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
