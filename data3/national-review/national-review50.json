In other words, in the friendly dispute between my friends and NR colleagues Andrew McCarthy and Dan McLaughlin, I\u2019m on Team Dan. But rather than weigh in at length, let me simply refer you to the persuasive and authoritative words of former Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher partner James Ho, writing in The Federalist in 2015:To be \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the U.S. is simply to be subject to the authority of the U.S. government.\u00a0The phrase thus covers the vast majority of persons within our borders who are required to obey U.S. laws. And obedience, of course, does not turn on immigration status, national allegiance, or past compliance. All must obey.Common usage confirms this understanding. When we speak of a business that is subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency, it must follow the laws of that agency, whether it likes it or not.\u00a0When we speak of an individual who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court, he must follow the judgments and orders of that court, whether he likes it or not.\u00a0As Justice Scalia noted just a year ago, when a statute renders a particular class of persons \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d Congress \u201chas made clear its intent to extend its laws\u201d to them.More:[T]he text of the Citizenship Clause plainly guarantees birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of all persons subject to U.S. sovereign authority and laws. The clause thus covers the vast majority of lawful and unlawful aliens. Of course, the jurisdictional requirement of the Citizenship Clause must do something \u2014 and it does. It excludes those persons who, for some reason, are immune from, and thus not required to obey, U.S. law. Most notably, foreign diplomats and enemy soldiers \u2014 as agents of a foreign sovereign \u2014 are not subject to U.S. law, notwithstanding their presence within U.S. territory.Foreign diplomats enjoy diplomatic immunity,\u00a0while lawful enemy combatants enjoy combatant immunity. Accordingly, children born to them are not entitled to birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment.This conclusion is confirmed by history. The Citizenship Clause was no legal innovation. It simply restored the longstanding English common law doctrine of\u00a0jus soli,\u00a0or citizenship by place of birth.\u00a0Although the doctrine was initially embraced in early American jurisprudence,\u00a0the U.S. Supreme Court abrogated\u00a0jus soli\u00a0in its infamous\u00a0Dred Scott\u00a0decision, denying birthright citizenship to the descendents of slaves.\u00a0Congress approved the Citizenship Clause to overrule\u00a0Dred Scott\u00a0and elevate\u00a0jus soli\u00a0to the status of constitutional law.Why quote Ho at such length? Because he\u2019s now Judge Ho, a Trump appointee sitting on the key Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He\u2019s a man who may very well write an appellate opinion in a case challenging a Trump executive order. Indeed, it was the Fifth Circuit that blocked President Obama\u2019s most dramatic use of the \u201cpen and phone\u201d \u2014 his Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA).Of course Judge Ho may not be representative of all Trump judges, but his thoughts do show the strength of the originalist interpretation that the 14th Amendment very broadly grants birthright citizenship. But even if different Trump judges disagree with Judge Ho\u2019s view, it\u2019s hard to think of a single Trump judge (and I\u2019m familiar with the writings and thinking of many of his nominees) who would hold that Trump could reject relevant federal statutes simply by signing an executive order. I completely agree with Andy McCarthy when he says, \u201c[T]he president may not unilaterally change an understanding of the law that has been in effect for decades under a duly enacted federal law.\u201dNo, he may not, and I not only have confidence that Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks would block his order, I don\u2019t believe the order would survive even a Trump district-court pick\u2019s review. Originalism and the plain meaning of federal statutes stand in the way of the Trump trial balloon. Let\u2019s hope it pops before the president can put his unconstitutional pen to paper.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
