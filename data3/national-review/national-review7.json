With less than three weeks to go until the election, Heitkamp already appeared to be at a disadvantage; most recent polls show Cramer with a double-digit lead.But that wasn\u2019t all she had to contend with. Heitkamp also had to find a way to use the hour-long debate to recoup her losses from earlier this week, when news broke that her campaign had identified a number of constituents as victims of sexual assault without their consent. The names of these women were included as signatories of an open letter to Cramer, which the Heitkamp campaign ran as an advertisement.\u201cThe ad is about non-consent. Why would they just go ahead and take our names without our consent? It\u2019s the same thing, just different case,\u201d one of the women told National Review this week.It\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s one that Heitkamp was forced to address during yesterday evening\u2019s debate. When the candidates were allotted two minutes for opening remarks, the Democratic senator used almost her entire time to apologize for her campaign\u2019s error.\u201cUnfortunately, this week I not only disappointed many in North Dakota, I disappointed myself,\u201d Heitkamp said. \u201cMy campaign wrongly listed many names in a campaign ad that were not authorized and not appropriate. This was a terrible mistake.\u201dGiven how much negative coverage her campaign has received for the misstep, using her opening statement to apologize was the right tactical move \u2014 not to mention the\u00a0right thing to do. But it undoubtedly was not how the flailing Democratic incumbent \u2014 running for reelection in a state that the sitting Republican president won by nearly 36 points \u2014 had hoped to start out the last debate of the election cycle against a popular, at-large congressman.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.Later in the debate, Heitkamp defended her vote against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, despite the fact that a majority of North Dakotans said they wanted their senators to confirm him. The senator acknowledged that her \u201cno\u201d vote contradicted her constituents but said it\u2019s more important for a politician to \u201cexercise the judgment God gave you\u201d than to consistently represent her voters\u2019 wishes. And after Cramer said that Senate Democrats had turned the fight over Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation into a spectacle, Heitkamp insisted that there was \u201cequal blame to go around.\u201dToday, the Heitkamp campaign is under fire again, this time for an advertisement apologizing to the women named in the previous ad. According to reports, the ad may have lacked the legally required disclaimer about having been paid for by a political-action committee. The newspaper that ran the ad says it received the payment from the Heitkamp campaign committee \u2014 which means the ad appears to be in violation of FEC guidelines.\u00a0Heitkamp\u2019s campaign has not responded to press inquiries on the subject.This year\u2019s race already promised to be a bitter fight for Heitkamp. She was first elected to the Senate in 2012 by a margin of just 3,000 votes, and this is the first time she\u2019s running for office with a legislative record, which makes it more difficult to present herself as being in line with North Dakota\u2019s conservative voters. Her campaign\u2019s blunders this week certainly haven\u2019t helped.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
