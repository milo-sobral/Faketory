In fact, when the economy is good, the party controlling the White House has a huge advantage. Democrats picked up five congressional seats in 1998, when President Bill Clinton was in office and the middle class was thriving. . . .But we know the flip side as well. When the American people think the economy\u2019s headed in the wrong direction, they\u2019re liable to punish the president\u2019s allies across the country. That\u2019s what happened in 1982, 1994, and 2006. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so remarkable that Republicans are struggling one week out from this year\u2019s midterm. . . .We\u2019re on the verge of watching the American people repudiate a sitting president despite a nominally strong economy. That\u2019s exceedingly rare.It is? Real GDP growth was 4 percent in 1994, 2.9 percent in 2006, and 2.5 percent in 2014 \u2014 all respectable numbers for the time periods in question, but all years when the party in power had bad elections. In all three cases the unemployment rate was falling.The fact is that midterms usually go badly for the party in power, and 1998 is one of only two exceptions since the 1930s. Emanuel\u2019s claims to the contrary read to me like a clumsy way to play the expectations game with the election results.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
