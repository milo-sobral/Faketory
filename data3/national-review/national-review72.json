Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.Dear Reader (Especially all incompetent conspiracy plotters),When I was in eleventh grade, my English teacher, Mrs. Bab, made me sit in the front row right by her desk to keep me from getting into trouble or talking to friends. One day, when we were reading Beowulf, Mrs. Bab called on my friend Henry (I\u2019ll leave his last name out of it) and asked him to summarize the story so far. Henry was a very capable B.S.er, but he was no match for Mrs. Bab.Henry, who had not done the reading, offered an improvisational tour de force, repeating back random words he picked up from the classroom conversation. \u201cGrendel and the Geats are fighting with Wiglaf for blah blah blah . . .\u201dMrs. Bab offered a two-word rebuke: \u201cDreadful, Henry.\u201dBut Henry didn\u2019t pick up that he was being rebuked at all. He thought that she was giving him a hint. \u201cRight,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cAnd then the Dreadfuls came down from Denmark . . .\u201dAt this point, all time slowed down for me. I turned to Mrs. Bab and, with my best Puss \u2019n Boots eyes, I plaintively whispered, \u201cPlease. Let. Him. Go. On.\u201dI wanted to hear Henry go on and on about the marauding Dreadfuls. Perhaps after a while, he could have added the heroic tale of Sir Awful and his band of Incompletes and Unacceptables. But it was not to be.I hadn\u2019t thought about all that for a long time, but that rich bouillabaisse of feelings \u2014 schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of others), fremdsch\u00e4men (embarrassment for others who don\u2019t have the good sense to be embarrassed for themselves), and plain joyful mirth and glee \u2014 came rushing back to me recently. This time, however, there was the added spice of Justice and Comeuppance in the broth. (Henry was at least my friend.)Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are awful people. Now, let me admit my own hypocrisy here. As part of my growing disillusionment with partisan politics and disdain for raw tribalism, I\u2019ve been trying \u2014 with only modest success \u2014 to pull back on the sort of casual mockery and demonization that was once part of my kit bag.But the essence of serious thinking is the ability to make serious distinctions between superficially similar things (and finding similarities between superficially different things \u2014 such as nationalism and socialism). And if we can\u2019t mock denizens of the coprophagic phylum inhabited by parasitasters such as Wohl and Burkman, then no one save the inhabitants of the handful of lower orders of garbage people \u2014 Nazis, terrorists, pedophiles, various Florida Men \u2014 can be mocked. That\u2019s not a world I want to live in. Civilization isn\u2019t achieved by eradicating social stigma, but by training it on the most worthy subjects.So, as I was saying: For the last 48 hours or so, these two jackwads have been beclowning themselves across such a broad spectrum of asininity that the mind reels to capture the glory of it. Only Hollywood could come up with a visual metaphor of their almost Nietzschean will to so completely live down to their reputations.I suppose that I should back up. Jacob Wohl (rhymes with troll \u2014 for a reason) is a Twitter gadfly and former financial grifter who once claimed at the age of 18 to have had decades of experience as a hedge-fund manager. Jack Burkman\u2019s first claim to fame came when he led an astroturf freak-out about an NFL quarterback being gay. Burkman\u2019s own (gay) brother explained that it was \u201cjust an attention grab and a media grab to pander to those folks who pay him to lobby on their behalf.\u201dPerhaps in the same spirit, Burkman became even more famous by peddling conspiracy theories that Seth Rich was murdered because of his involvement in the leak of the DNC emails. I should also add that they both became Trump sycophants from afar, no doubt sensing opportunities for grift and the fame that could create more opportunities for grifting.Which brings me to this week. Burkman and Wohl announced that they had learned of evidence that Robert Mueller had \u201cbrutally raped\u201d a woman named Caroline Cass.Wohl is now walking through the accusation, saying his client was \"brutally raped\" by Mueller. There's already inconsistencies between his account and the docs handed out. pic.twitter.com/rM5I4FA7jH\u2014 Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) November 1, 2018This evidence came from Surefire Intelligence, a supposedly highly regarded investigation firm.Before their Thursday press conference, Wohl denied having anything to do with Surefire Intelligence. \u201cI don\u2019t have any involvement in any investigations of any kind,\u201d he told NBC News.But Wohl apparently had no idea that the journalism profession contains individuals who know how to use the Internet. Many of the photos on the Surefire Intelligence website were stock photos, including one of the Israeli model Bar Refaeli. Another shadowy image, when brightened, revealed Wohl himself. When NBC called the listed phone number for Surefire, it went straight to Wohl\u2019s mom\u2019s voicemail.John McCormack has more details, but you get the point. These guys are idiots. Yes, they are funny idiots because it\u2019s always funny when idiots celebrate their idiocy as genius. Burkman defended Wohl\u2019s age at the press conference, insisting that \u201cJacob is a child prodigy who has eclipsed Mozart.\u201d(FWIW Mozart\u2019s first public performance was at the age of five. At six, he played for the royal court. By seven, he played across Europe. At twelve, he wrote his first opera. And so on).When Wohl was pressed for evidence that Mueller\u2019s accuser even exists \u2014 she almost surely doesn\u2019t \u2014 he offered a picture of a woman with her face blocked out.It turns out that, again, Wohl underestimated the wizardry of the computer age. The woman in the picture was his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201dI put that in quotes because that woman denies she ever dated him.This gets funnier.  The photo of the \"accuser\" is just an old photo of what Wohl said was his girlfriend, with the face MS Painted-out.Now the woman allegedly in the photo claims they've never dated and Wohl is lying about having dated her. https://t.co/HkienzheV6\u2014 Donny Ferguson \ud83d\uddfd (@DonnyFerguson) November 2, 2018It\u2019s like Wohl is in his own Choose Your Own Adventure book, and every direction he goes leads him to a room where he has to punch himself in the crotch, while women he never dated point and laugh. No wonder this guy was Gateway Pundit\u2019s ace reporter.But just because they are idiots, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t evil. Cesar Sayoc, the mail bomber from last week, was apparently an idiot too. We don\u2019t know for sure yet, but it appears he really did think his bombs would work. If that\u2019s the case, his incompetence has no bearing on his villainy. Likewise, these wormtongued rantallians wanted to falsely accuse Mueller of rape.If you were outraged by what Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s enemies tried to do to him, you should be no less outraged by what these peddlers of malicious jiggery-pokery tried to do.\u00a0By all means laugh, I certainly am. But these guys need to go to jail all the same.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.Maybe in prison, Wohl can fulfill his destiny as a child prodigy by inventing toilet-brewed pruno that Mozart could never have imagined.I loved this line from CNN\u2019s Don Lemon:\u201cWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them.\u201dAs I said on Twitter, that sentence is like a snake eating its own tail. In a funny way, it reminds me of John Locke\u2019s \u201cLetter Concerning Toleration,\u201d which was a hugely important advance for mankind and the ideas of religious tolerance and pluralism. Paraphrasing it in Lemonesque terms, Locke said, \u201cWe have to stop oppressing people of different faiths and realize that the biggest religious threat in this country is from Catholics, most of them radicalized by the evil pope in Rome, and we have to start doing something about them.\u201dIn fairness, if you listen to the broader context, Lemon\u2019s not quite as demonizing of all white men as it seems from just that one soundbite. But it remains the case that if a Fox News host said virtually the exact same thing but replaced \u201cwhite men\u201d with \u201cblack men\u201d or \u201cMuslim men,\u201d you can be sure that Don Lemon would be among the first to decry the racism or bigotry on display, and no appeal to broader context or data would change his mind.Oh, and about that data: Color me skeptical. The chart most frequently tweeted showing that right-wing white-male terrorism is America\u2019s most serious threat begins in 2007, which is a pretty convenient date. But my skepticism isn\u2019t really about the numbers. It\u2019s the effort to lump in all of these different mass shooters as \u201cright-wing\u201d \u201cwhite male\u201d \u201cterrorists.\u201d For example, this article at Vox includes in its list of white-male killers the Las Vegas shooter and the Republican baseball-practice shooter. The former\u2019s motives are unknown and the latter\u2019s were left-wing. Again, I think that white-nationalist or white-supremacist groups are a real threat and that they should be taken seriously. But that\u2019s not typically how it\u2019s discussed on cable news or Twitter. In part because of Trump hatred but also Trump\u2019s rhetoric, enormously important distinctions are blurred, and sweeping guilt by association is the order of the day.Consider the understandable passion around the Squirrel Hill synagogue shooter. You would get the sense that anti-Semitic hate crimes in America are the sole provenance of angry white men. But anti-Semitic incidents (none nearly as horrific as the synagogue shooting) are remarkably common \u2014 far more common than anti-Muslim hate crimes. In New York City, where most of the media figures decrying the anti-Semitism unleashed by Trump live, not a single anti-Semitic act has been attributed to far-right groups in the last 22 months. And, again, anti-Semitic incidents are frequent in the Big Apple.Contrary to what are surely the prevailing assumptions, anti-Semitic incidents have constituted half of all hate crimes in New York this year, according to the Police Department. To put that figure in context, there have been four times as many crimes motivated by bias against Jews \u2014 142 in all \u2014 as there have against blacks. Hate crimes against Jews have outnumbered hate crimes targeted at transgender people by a factor of 20.It\u2019s almost as if anti-Semitism is a huge problem only when it can be used as a partisan cudgel.The notion that white men \u2014 about a third of the U.S. population \u2014 are a terror threat is a real \u201cBig, if true\u201d statement. The problem with Lemon\u2019s claim isn\u2019t the point he was trying to make but the glibness of how he stated it \u2014 and how he thinks about it. And he\u2019s hardly alone. You can find similar lazy bigotry on MSNBC and CNN daily.Tucker Carlson made this point last night on Fox.I agree with a lot of what Tucker says here. My only problem is that you can find the \u201cright-wing\u201d version of the same phenomena on Fox and elsewhere on the right all the time. Though, I will say that it\u2019s less naked, in part because of the double standards we have about what you can and can\u2019t say about white people and non-white people. And, unlike Lemon who has doubled-down on his comments, when Fox hosts cross a line, they often \u2014 though hardly always \u2014 apologize.But there\u2019s one thing Tucker said that I would like to focus on.If you want to know what Democrats are thinking, watch CNN and MSNBC. Which over the past couple of years have come to function much as the DNC used to function, as the Democratic Party\u2019s Brain Trust and mouthpiece.I think this is indisputably true. I\u2019ve been amazed of late to hear the folks on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe openly exhort viewers to vote Democrat. It\u2019s not remotely subtle anymore.But can anyone dispute that something very similar can be said about Fox News?There\u2019s an important distinction to be made. There\u2019s an asymmetry between Fox and MSNBC and CNN. Fox has a distinct separation between its opinion shows and news shows. The separation can get fuzzy for viewers, depending on what pundits are asked to come on as guests. But the actual news anchors \u2014 Bret Baier, Shepherd Smith, Chris Wallace, Bill Hemmer, etc. \u2014 do not hector viewers to vote Republican or go on opinion-laden stemwinders about how Comrade Trump will deliver the greatest wheat harvests man has ever seen. With a handful of exceptions, mostly at CNN (Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer come to mind), many of the news people at CNN and MSNBC often indulge in sweeping partisan punditry. I think Chuck Todd tries to be even-handed, but people such as Lemon, Chris Cuomo, Stephanie Ruhl, Andrea Mitchell, and Christiane Amanpour go back and forth across the line between news and opinion constantly.This is one reason why Trump\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric works. Viewers see people who claim to be heroic guardians of objective reporting go on endless anti-Trump tirades that often drift into sweeping denunciations of Trump voters and even white people generally.That said, the opinion side of Fox and Fox Business \u2014 where I still have quite a few friends \u2014 is top-heavy with people who serve as the de facto Brain Trust and mouthpiece for Donald Trump (with the most notable exceptions being Dana Perino and Neil Cavuto, both of whom I have a lot of respect for). There\u2019s a reason why Fox & Friends is called the \u201cPresident\u2019s Daily Brief.\u201dMy point here is one I keep returning to these days. Each team wants to say that the other team is violating norms \u2014 and they\u2019re right. And each team says in response, \u201cYou\u2019re a hypocrite\u201d or, \u201cWho are you to cast stones when so-and-so said X.\u201d And they\u2019re right, too.Career-wise, it\u2019s probably insane for me to write any of this. But I just don\u2019t care anymore. This timeline is so bizarre that if I saw an old-fashioned British phone booth in my driveway, I\u2019d jump in and hit every button I saw.Maybe if I was lucky, it\u2019d take me to the timeline where Mitch Daniels is president. Or maybe, even better, it\u2019d take me to Spaniel Heaven.There are two \u2014 two! \u2014 new Remnant podcasts this week. The first Remnant with Reihan is a freewheeling wonk-a-thon on immigration, nationalism, conservatism, and Reihan\u2019s dismaying Bismarkian tendencies.The second is double-whammy: a conversation with laid-off Uber driver Ben Sasse, and then some purely rank punditry from me.Canine Update: The beasts love Fall. They love, love, love, love, love, love it (the cats like it too). We do have to look them over for ticks quite a bit these days, but they are on the junk that keeps the pests from actually attaching. A staple conversation between the Fair Jessica and me is how much Zo\u00eb and Pippa would like this place or that. Whenever we drive past a farm or ranch, we\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, the Dingo would like it there\u201d or some such. I\u2019ll often say Zo\u00eb would like some place because it looks like it\u2019s full of critters that she can hunt and kill. But my wife has always argued that Zo\u00eb\u2019s true earthly Valhalla is suburbia. And it\u2019s true. She loves being off leash running around through people\u2019s yards chasing critters that think they are safe. We can\u2019t really let her do that in our neighborhood because there are too many small dogs around, and Zo\u00eb has a number overlapping prejudices. She\u2019s very territorial about her neighborhood \u2014 no other dogs but Pippa should be allowed here. She\u2019s also a bit of a kick-down/kiss-up type. She\u2019ll growl at big dogs on her turf, but she knows her limits. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve always thought \u2014 with some evidence mind you \u2014 that Zo\u00eb\u2019s semi-wild status came out most gloriously on mountain hikes and the like.I\u2019ve come to change my mind. The other morning, I had to get to the NPR studios very early. So we did a walk around the neighborhood around 5:00 a.m.\u00a0I know from experience that no one walks their dogs that early around here. So I took a chance and let her off the leash. And Oh My Stars and Garters did she love it. She zoomed up and down the block, investigating one rumored rabbit bunker after another. She zipped around silently mouthing, \u201cThis is great! This is so great!\u201d She didn\u2019t catch anything. But it did dawn on me that not only was my wife right, but that this only buttressed her serial-killer status. So many of the great serial killers \u2014 Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, the dude in the closet in When a Stranger Calls \u2014 preyed in suburban hunting grounds.Meanwhile, Pippa\u2019s a lover, so her favorite thing about suburbia is running up to people and dropping tennis balls at their feet. He true joys are water, mud, and tennis balls, preferably in combination. And while the water can\u2019t come to Pippa, she\u2019s perfectly happy chasing a tennis ball in the backyard or a tennis court or pretty much anyplace else.Gracie meanwhile is more refined. Which Zo\u00eb and Pippa can appreciate.ICYMI . . .The latest GLoPLast week\u2019s G-FileHoward Dean is foolishTrump is corrupting nationalismMy UNC\u2013Chapel Hill speechTrump didn\u2019t cause the Pittsburgh massacre, but he\u2019s not helpingJohn Locke on zombiesThe upside of Trump\u2019s Twitter obsessionMy interview on Planet HawkinsWhen NR\u2019s fastest talkers collideAmerica shouldn\u2019t become a parliamentary systemAnd now, the weird stuff.Debby\u2019s Friday linksAmerican saves Magna CartaAmericans drink Iceland\u2019s beerFried brain sandwichAre cats evil?Are dogs good?Well . . . are they?A house of the future . . . as envisioned by 1945The world\u2019s first carThe last lighthouse keeper in CapriIf the Pentagon tried to build the Death Star . . .Mr. Feeny for the winDeep-sea octopiForgotten Supreme Court historyZombie antsBeauty can be yoursChampagne supernovaReagan was awesomeNR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
