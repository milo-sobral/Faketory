(Of course, more governmental action is their solution to every problem, real or imagined.)Recently, readers of\u00a0The Atlantic were treated to such an article by Amanda Ripley. She sought to explain why the cost of college has been rising so quickly for the last several decades. She managed to completely miss the elephant in the room, namely federal higher-ed subsidies.In today\u2019s Martin Center commentary, economics professor Richard Vedder corrects her errors.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.He writes:She fails to even fleetingly mention one thing unique to American higher education that has been an enormous factor in driving up costs: the federal student financial assistance programs. The money from those programs has provided universities an opportunity to raise fees aggressively, using the proceeds to fund a very costly and unproductive academic arms race, including ultra-posh buildings, climbing walls and lazy rivers, and college sports programs that are out of control both financially and morally.That omission is not surprising. Progressives can never bring themselves to admit that any of their \u201ccompassionate\u201d programs like minimum-wage laws, rent control, or educational subsidies have adverse effects.Vedder also points out (based on his long experience in higher ed) that most college leaders have no interest in cost control. They would much rather compete on prestige and luxurious amenities than on price.His conclusion \u201csticks the landing,\u201d as they\u2019d say in gymnastics:\u00a0\u201cGovernment has been the problem, not the solution. In the era before big government came to dominate higher education, fees grew less rapidly than people\u2019s income, enrollments rose, and America became acknowledged as the world\u2019s leading center for learning at the highest levels. We can return to high quality, affordable higher education, but only if we\u2019re willing to end federal subsidies. It\u2019s time for liberals to understand that.\u201dNR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
