In the name of getting guns off the street, the department has taken to stopping and frisking pedestrians, and searching cars as well. Per NPR, in \u201c2016, D.C. police confiscated more than five times as many illegal guns per capita as did the New York City Police Department, and nearly twice that of the Los Angeles Police, according to police data.\u201dThe numbers grab your attention, which is what the department hopes for. But as James Trainum, a retired D.C. homicide detective who works with the Constitution Project on policing reform, tells National Review: \u201cAny time there\u2019s a spike, there needs to be a question: Why?\u201dIt recalls the way Philadelphia seized five times as many assets as Los Angeles, despite having less than one-sixth its population. Philadelphia\u2019s program ended with a settlement wherein the city acknowledged wrongdoing and agreed to pay $3 million to its victims.WAMU and American University\u2019s Investigative Reporting Workshop went through D.C.\u2019s numbers and revealed some shocking trends. Forty percent of these gun-possession cases were dismissed, revealing clearly that in the rush for volume, quality policing and the rule of law (not to mention the Fourth Amendment) are being abandoned. And in the process, the relationship between the citizenry and law enforcement is breaking down even further.Assistant police chief Robert Contee has defended the aggressive search policy, saying that a cost in community trust is still superior to a cost in lives \u2014 but the impact of community\u2013police relations can\u2019t really be waved away so easily. Trainum is disappointed by this response, saying, \u201cTo me the whole thing is very disturbing. If you get 40 percent of your cases dismissed, you should want to correct that.\u201d If this doesn\u2019t receive pushback from higher ups, \u201cYou\u2019re violating civil rights [and] encouraging officers to cut corners.\u201d\nTrainum points out that \u201cif 40 percent of the forest is rotten, and you don\u2019t realize it, it\u2019s going to damage the rest of the trees.\u201d The problem starts here, at the point of arrests and roundups. After all, these are the ways in which communities encounter the police most vividly, and if entire neighborhoods become fearful of cops, it makes it difficult to tackle actual violent crimes.\u201cOne of the biggest complaints from homicide detectives is: \u2018We can\u2019t solve cases because people don\u2019t talk to us,\u2019\u201d Trainum says. \u201cIf the uniformed officers are out there cheating and getting pats on the back for getting guns off the street, [residents] are not going to trust police.\u201d This, in turn, means that murders and other violent crimes go unsolved.The numbers game isn\u2019t limited to uniformed officers. Trainum points out that, to most detectives, the \u201cclosure rate is more important than the conviction rate,\u201d but this is a much less useful metric for measuring law enforcement. \u201cD.C. has a very, very high homicide closure rate that\u2019s outside the norm, so why aren\u2019t other departments flocking to D.C. to learn [about] it?\u201d Colorfully, he answers the question: \u201cIt\u2019s because they know the numbers are bullsh**.\u201dThe numbers game compromises the rule of law in the District, and it inhibits proper policing by breaking down trust between citizenry and law enforcement. How can this gulf be bridged? And how might police move away from the current numbers-based approach?\nTrainum believes that fixing the problem needs to start at the training stage for police officers: \u201cWe really don\u2019t have a lot of training in what our job really is, and the ethics involved.\u201d Better instruction in constitutional safeguards against search and seizure, and a culture that recognizes police are enforcers of the law and not simply enforcers would be a start. But the practice of prioritizing arrests over good cases needs to be reformed. Trainum proposes adopting some best practices from other fields; he cites the Sentinel event-review system in medicine, which evaluates the surrounding factors after a patient death to determine what went wrong. A tracking system for police behavior, which would quantify the false positives both in searches from dogs and from personnel, and effective \u201cquality assurance\u201d for policing, while tedious and maybe not as marketable as other policing programs, is the only way to show what is actually working.If the police department starts admitting its mistakes and making an effort to correct them, that will go a long way towards healing the rift between community and police, Trainum argues, based on his experience on the force. But if it digs in its heels, the situation will only get worse. Violence is a real problem, and there is a need for law enforcement, but a police department that seems to have lost the mandate of those it claims to protect won\u2019t be able to accomplish any of this. Constitutional policing is in the interests of cops and community alike, but whether it will come about remains to be seen.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
