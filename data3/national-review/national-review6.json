It\u2019s more like sculpture.\u201d A light goes on in Van Gogh. This contrarian .\u00a0.\u00a0. this recusant .\u00a0.\u00a0. this redhead resolves to do the opposite of what he\u2019s been told. He not only continues to overpaint, he over-overpaints. The canvas doesn\u2019t know what hit it. \u201cIt is the universal, mad and blinding coruscation of things,\u201d wrote the first critic of Van Gogh\u2019s work, Albert Aurier. \u201cIt is matter and all of Nature frenetically contorted. .\u00a0.\u00a0. It is form, becoming nightmare; color, becoming flame, lava and precious stone; light turning into conflagration; life, into burning fever.\u201dThe painter and filmmaker Julian Schnabel tries to organize his movie into a burning fever, and partially succeeds. Van Gogh\u2019s intoxicating swirls, his effulgent colors, his starburst energy carry the film, which Schnabel co-wrote and directed with Willem Dafoe as his Vincent. (After playing at the New York Film Festival, it is set for a November 16 theatrical release.) Though uneven, particularly in the matter of its ungainly writing, it\u2019s a worthy tribute.Beginning in overcast Paris, Van Gogh strikes up a friendship with Gauguin (Oscar Isaac), who resolves to leave all systems behind and strikes out huffily for Madagascar. Van Gogh dislikes the grisaille quotidienne of the city and yearns for sunlight. \u201cGo south,\u201d Gauguin tells him, as though his friend couldn\u2019t have figured out Provence is sunny. Such cloddish, audience-signaling dialogue mars the screenplay Schnabel co-wrote with Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and Louise Kugelberg. Later in the film Van Gogh tells a priest he is painting for \u201cpeople who haven\u2019t been born yet.\u201d That seems conveniently backward-looking, a line written from a 21st-century perspective, but, worse, it baldly states what need not be stated. We\u2019ve seen that Van Gogh lives in poverty in Arles, supported by his businessman brother Theo (Rupert Friend), and we\u2019re aware that the paintings first seen in hilarious profusion cluttering up a wall in a tavern are today worth millions, in some cases tens of millions.Yet if Schnabel, the director of one of the few truly sublime films released this century, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, is a shaky writer he brings the appropriate visual allure to the story. Using colors and landscapes familiar from the canvases, he creates moments of serene beauty out of watching Van Gogh work, reveling in how the land, or a model, or even a still life looks through the painter\u2019s appreciative gaze. A Van Gogh movie is not the place to exercise restraint: \u201cI want to be out of control, I want to be in a fever state,\u201d the painter says, and who could doubt it, from looking at the The Starry Night? \u201cThe faster I paint,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe better I feel.\u201d At one point Van Gogh produces 75 paintings in 80 days. Rebuke and shame hit me as I realized I couldn\u2019t produce 75 movie reviews in 80 days. In Arles, Van Gogh was an eruption of life force.And its awful opposite number. Schnabel parts company with most biographers in that he advances a theory, from Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith\u2019s book Van Gogh: The Life, that the end of the painter\u2019s life was not suicide but involved an accidental shooting. Still, darkness was a constant companion. Out of mercy, or respect, Schnabel does not depict the deranged moment in which Van Gogh sawed off his left ear because he was despondent about feeling rejected by Gauguin, instead limiting himself to Van Gogh\u2019s dazed recollection of the event. That is Dafoe\u2019s big moment of the film, yet it doesn\u2019t quite break the heart.Dafoe makes an adequate Van Gogh, not a shattering one. As much intensity as he has brought to the screen in his career, he is no longer quite right for the part. At 63, he is far too old to play the painter, who died at 37. Also he speaks French like a tourist.\nWhile Dafoe wrestles with his accent, so Schnabel has trouble keeping his admiration from swamping the biography. The worship reaches a comical level when, interviewed by the priest at the insane asylum, Van Gogh compares the situation to Pilate\u2019s interrogation of Christ. \u201cJesus wasn\u2019t discovered until 30 or 40 years after he died,\u201d Vincent says. Schnabel seems eager to depict Van Gogh as a man of faith, but comparing oneself to Jesus Christ is not how one exhibits Christian bona fides. And let\u2019s not say Jesus Christ was \u201cdiscovered.\u201d Save that term for magazine pieces about Gisele B\u00fcndchen.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
