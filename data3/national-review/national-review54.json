From the position paper published in The Annals of Internal Medicine:b. Physicians are encouraged to discuss with their patients the risks that may be associated with having a firearm in the home and recommend ways to mitigate such risks, including best practices to reduce injuries and deaths.c. Physicians should become informed about firearms injury prevention. Medical schools, residency programs, and continuing medical education (CME) programs should incorporate firearm violence prevention into their curricula.d. Physicians are encouraged, individually and through their professional societies, to advocate for national, state, and local efforts to enact legislation to implement evidence-based policies, including those recommended in this paper, to reduce the risk of preventable injuries and deaths from firearms, including but not limited to universal background checks.If doctors want to advocate for certain gun control laws, more power to them.

That\u2019s not an area of \u201cmedical expertise.\u201dIf I choose to own a firearm, it is not my doctor\u2019s business. Moreover, if I do, safety will certainly be my most paramount concern. But the very best place to learn those practices is not from doctors. It is from the NRA or others with equivalent firearms expertise.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
