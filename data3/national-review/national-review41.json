Some key bits:Most important, the study does not actually claim to count \u201canti-Semitic incidents,\u201d as such but rather the reporting of these events. First, it purports to count those incidents that\u00a0have been reported to the ADL by the media, law enforcement, and the public. The ADL acknowledges that some of the increase in documented incidents is not an actual increase, but results from\u00a0\u201cmore people . . . reporting incidents to ADL than ever before.\u201dSecond, the report does not count only actual anti-Semitic incidents, but any incident that results \u201cin Jews\u00a0perceiving themselves\u00a0as being victimized due to their Jewish identity.\u201d\u00a0As a result of this methodological tic, the ADL\u2019s tally includes 163 bomb threats made to Jewish Community Centers and other Jewish institutions in early 2017, even though the two perpetrators were not motivated by anti-Semitism.. . .Finally, it\u2019s worth noting, that despite showing a 57 percent increase in incidents overall, from 1,267 to 1,986, the ADL study shows a 47 percent\u00a0decrease\u00a0in physical assaults, from 37 to 19. This is obviously inconsistent with the meme that 2017 saw a surge in violent anti-Semitism. Physical assaults are also the most objective sort of incident to document, which adds to concerns about the robustness of the rest of the data.I\u2019d add that, while the FBI\u2019s data aren\u2019t comprehensive either \u2014 not all incidents are reported to the police, and not all police departments report their data to the FBI \u2014 it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on them, as (judging by when they were released last year) they should be updated with 2017 numbers soon. Between 2015 and 2016, anti-Semitic incidents rose from 664 to 684, or 3 percent. Hate incidents in general, about a tenth of which are anti-Semitic, rose about 5 percent.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
