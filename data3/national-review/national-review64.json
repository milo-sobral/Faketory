It\u2019s not beginning to look a lot like Christmas quite yet, outside of trigger-happy department stores preying on prudent grandmothers to get their shopping finished before the season is in full swing and parking lots are packed with holiday shoppers \u2014 but inside my kitchen cabinet is my artillery of holiday spices and cookie cutters, ready for snowmen and Christmas-tree-shaped cookies. My closet is stocked with red cable-knit sweaters and velvet dresses that I bought at the end of the last Christmas season, with tags ready to finally be removed.Christmas is such a wonderful time of year \u2014 the most wonderful \u2014 that I want to begin preparing for it while candy wrappers are still fresh on the ground from trick-or-treaters.I\u2019ve discovered that this makes me a pariah. When I admit that I\u2019m the type who appreciates beginning Christmas prematurely, people act as though I\u2019ve denied Allah\u2019s existence in Mecca. I understand that consumerism is largely responsible for choosing the earliest possible date to begin the season, in order to maximize sales. But what\u2019s so wrong about extending the joy and purity of the season leading up to the celebration of Christ\u2019s birthday \u2014 the most important holiday of the year, alongside Easter \u2014 by a few weeks, perhaps allowing it to remind us of its magnitude, and as a preface to Advent? What\u2019s so wrong about scouting out the Walmart Christmas aisle once it\u2019s constructed (and may still have remnants of costumes and candy from Halloween) and reading through meaningful, edifying messages on cards in lieu of reading the latest breaking-news story reminding us of our depraved political hellscape? What\u2019s so wrong about spending more time reviving Christmas traditions that we\u2019ve inherited, and that remind us of our families and innocence, when the world around us seems to want to spend the rest of the year flirting with the \u201cprogress\u201d continuum that has often suppressed this heritage?As much as I consider eggnog an affront to food \u2014 the only time booze and raw eggs should ever be combined is in tiramisu \u2014 it\u2019s a staple of Christmas dining, and one that Americans remember to resurrect every year. We can also expect the revival of swing and jazz on the radio, even among people who aren\u2019t my Boomer-aged father, who winces at the sound of music popular among Millenials but who can, for a few weeks of the year, listen to Perry Como or Frank Sinatra with young adults and children. It\u2019s the opportunity to tell children why we celebrate Christmas, and the wonderful Biblical story of the birth of Jesus and of the three kings who visited Him.The season gives us a rare time capsule, and that\u2019s the source of its warmth \u2014 the memories from our childhoods, the comfort of sentiment that tradition gives us.\nIf we could find a balance between the excess splurging on gifts on Black Friday (I\u2019ve visited war zones with less contention than Macy\u2019s on that day), then maybe an early Christmas season could rejuvenate us, and allow us to refocus our lives on what actually matters.In the meantime, I\u2019ll be searching for vegan alternatives to eggnog.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
