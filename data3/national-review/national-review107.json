Million Dollar Baby, one of the few boxing movies to break out of the box, is not coincidentally among the greatest movies this century.Creed II sticks to the formula like dogma and doesn\u2019t even seem all that interested in the details of how to win (or train for) a fight. There\u2019s nothing like the tactical surprise of a southpaw fighting right-handed here, nor any workout scenes as exhilarating as the many great ones in the earlier movies. Nevertheless, a surprise-free movie can be a satisfying one, if the grace notes are played with care. They are in Creed II.The sequel to 2015\u2019s Creed, a spinoff from the six Rocky Balboa films, finds the late Apollo Creed\u2019s son Adonis \u201cDonny\u201d Creed (a superb Michael B. Jordan) on the verge of capturing the heavyweight championship while he tries to work up the nerve to propose to his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu) angrily trains for a chance to fight Creed for the title. In the 1985 Cold War proxy Rocky IV, Viktor\u2019s father Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) killed Adonis\u2019s father Apollo before being defeated by Rocky.Yes, Sylvester Stallone is back and gives another warm, finely tuned performance. Stallone has played the character in at least one Rocky film each decade going back to the Ford administration, and this 42-year, eight-film run is without parallel in movie history. How he has made the Philly fighter endure is a subject for another day, but Stallone deserves more respect than he has gotten as both a writer and an actor. (He co-wrote this entry with Juel Taylor, from a story by himself, Sascha Penn, and Cheo Hodari Coker.)The fight scenes are the least interesting ones in the movie, but thanks to sensitive, low-key direction by 30-year-old Steven Caple Jr. in only his second feature, everything else works nicely. Caple stages some sweet scenes between Adonis and Bianca, a singer who is deaf without her hearing aids, as the couple frets about how their baby daughter will turn out. (Rocky suggests naming her \u201cKate.\u201d Donny replies, \u201cYou know she\u2019s going to be black, right?\u201d) Family bonds are more important than boxing achievements in the film, and properly so.\nCaple doesn\u2019t overdo the echoes with earlier Rocky films, but they\u2019re there: Bianca spends one bout nervously watching in a woolen beret that recalls Adrian\u2019s headgear in the original film. There\u2019s also a toned-down reprise of bits of Bill Conti\u2019s unforgettable musical score. (If anything, the movie could have used more of this to pump up the excitement during the so-so climax.) Aware that Rocky IV veered toward jingoism and kitsch, Caple arranges for the conflict with Drago\u2019s side to be mean and gritty instead. \u201cBreak him,\u201d Ivan advises his son during a fight. The Dragos don\u2019t just want to win, they want to maim Adonis. \u201cThis is why they look down on us,\u201d Ivan tells Viktor. Post\u2013Cold War, the resentment of America\u2019s preeminence continues in different form. But as Rocky points out, boxers who have nothing to lose are dangerous, and Creed has much more to lose than Viktor, who when he\u2019s not in the ring is but a manual laborer in a chilly country.Creed II doesn\u2019t have the jubilance or the vitality that Creed had, but its unhurried style is consonant with the mood of Rocky Balboa, the 2006 film that at the time appeared to be the final chapter in the saga. At this point, there is no urgent need to continue with the series; Jordan doesn\u2019t require the exposure, being one of the hottest young stars in Hollywood. A death scene for Rocky would seem to be the natural close, but Stallone is evidently reluctant to kill off his defining character, who appeared to be on his last legs in the two previous movies only to rebound this time. Maybe that\u2019s just as well; Mickey, Adrian, and Apollo may be dead, but Rocky\u2019s defining quality was always his endurance. All he wanted to do was go the distance. Forty-two years later, I\u2019d say he\u00a0has.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
