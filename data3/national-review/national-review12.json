By participating in this voluntary program, employers can ensure that their workers are in the country legally; were its use made mandatory, the attraction of illegal immigration would decline precipitously. Because so many illegal immigrants come by overstaying visas rather than by sneaking across the border, its potential effect is far greater than that of even a border wall.The 115th Congress has failed to pass legislation to this effect, but with an immigration restrictionist in the White House for at least two more years, there is still hope for the 116th \u2014 if it has a clear mandate to do so. This is why it\u2019s crucial for Republican Senate candidates to strongly endorse E-Verify. Many candidates have done so. But others have been quieter on the issue, and they need to speak up.Among the Republicans with a decent chance to win next month, there are many who have aggressively promoted E-Verify in the past \u2014 sometimes when it really mattered. Arizona\u2019s Martha McSally, Tennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn, and North Dakota\u2019s Kevin Cramer all cosponsored a bill in the House, the Securing America\u2019s Future Act, that among much else would have mandated the program. Current Republican senators up for reelection Deb Fischer (Nebraska) and Roger Wicker (Mississippi) cosponsored a recent bill to mandate E-Verify as well.Florida governor Rick Scott has required state agencies and contractors to use the program; Indiana businessman Mike Braun uses it at his own company. Mitt Romney, running to take Orrin Hatch\u2019s Senate seat in Utah, supported the program during his presidential run and continues to endorse a \u201csimplified legal status verification system\u201d in which employers who hired illegal workers would be sanctioned. In Ohio, Jim Renacci\u2019s website endorses \u201cinstituting a nationwide E-Verify system.\u201d Texas senator Ted Cruz, too, has argued in the course of his reelection campaign that E-Verify is an essential component of immigration reform. But even these candidates do not all explicitly endorse mandatory E-Verify on their 2018 campaign websites, and others\u2019 positions are even harder for the average voter to suss out \u2014 some of them candidates who take a strong stance on the underlying issue of illegal immigration. Wyoming\u2019s John Barrasso and Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller cast assorted pro\u2013E-Verify votes years ago but have not spoken up too loudly of late. Senate hopefuls Josh Hawley in Missouri and Cindy Hyde-Smith in Mississippi vociferously oppose illegal immigration but do not promote E-Verify in particular on their sites.Even some Democratic senators, facing desperate electoral circumstances, have embraced E-Verify. North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill sponsored a bill this year to require it. What\u2019s the holdup for Republicans?\nShould the GOP gain ground next month, a serious immigration reform may again be on the table. At that point, the GOP will need to be united \u2014 and will need a clear command from voters to address illegal immigration in an effective way. Vocally supporting E-Verify now can provide candidates that mandate, and may help them win their races to begin with as well.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
