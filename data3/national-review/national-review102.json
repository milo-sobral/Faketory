Before meeting with his cabinet, the president said he would be asking every secretary to trim 5 percent, \u201cif not more,\u201d from his or her budget. Nor would he exempt the Department of Defense.Here\u2019s hoping Trump changes his mind. Cutting the resources available to the Pentagon is a bad idea. A new report from the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission underscores just how bad.\u201cProviding for the Common Defense\u201d is the consensus of a dozen national-security experts, including Jack Keane, Senator Jon Kyl, Eric Edelman, Gary Roughead, Michael Morell, Anne Patterson, and Roger Zakheim. These are sober people. Experienced people. They are not given to exaggeration. Yet their conclusions are alarming. \u201cThe security and wellbeing of the United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades,\u201d they write. \u201cAmerica\u2019s military superiority\u2014the hard-power backbone of its global influence and national security\u2014has eroded to a dangerous degree.\u201dGreat-power competition returned as our military advantage dissipated. \u201cAmerica\u2019s ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt.\u201dThat\u2019s more than a wakeup call. It\u2019s an air horn inches from your ear.\nNot only has the range of threats expanded. So has the battle space. In addition to China and Russia, there are the smaller weapon-states the autocracies use to probe, divide, and entrap America and her allies: North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Nor has the Salafi-jihadist movement left the field. Reduced to its last bastions in Syria, ISIS and its comrades await the moment the United States exits Afghanistan.Once America had to assert supremacy over global sea lanes and air traffic. Now it must also claim the high ground in the commons of space and cyber. \u201cU.S. military superiority is no longer assured,\u201d says the commission, \u201cand the implications for American interests and American security are severe.\u201dThis crisis was a long time in the making. For decades, America has short-changed defense, especially our navy, ground forces, nuclear weapons, ballistic-missile defenses, and the research and development necessary to maintain a qualitative strategic edge. Yet the commission points to the Budget Control Act of 2011 \u2014 the so-called sequester \u2014 as the essential instrument of our debilitation. \u201cIn percentage terms,\u201d the authors write, the sequester was responsible for \u201cthe fastest drawdown since the years following the Korean War.\u201dThe withering of resources occurred as American soldiers fought in Afghanistan, returned to Iraq and entered Syria, and found themselves deployed in places like Niger. \u201cBy 2017, all of the military services were at or near post-World War II lows in terms of end-strength, and all were confronting severe readiness crises and enormous deferred modernization costs.\u201d The military budget was increased in FY2013, FY2015, and again most significantly in FY2018 thanks to President Trump and the Republican 115th Congress. It is not enough. \u201cAs the world has become more threatening, America has weakened its own defense.\u201dThe commission supports the National Defense Strategy released earlier this year by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and lauds \u201cits candid assessment of the strategic environment, the priority it places on preparing for major-power competition and conflict, its emphasis on the enduring value of U.S. alliances and partnerships, and its attention to issues of readiness and lethality.\u201d The Pentagon document complemented the National Security Strategy and its doctrine of \u201cprincipled realism\u201d issued by the White House last December. What troubles the commission, however, is a lack of specificity. \u201cAbsent a more integrated, whole-of-government strategy than has been evident to date, the United States is unlikely to reverse its rivals\u2019 momentum across an evolving, complex spectrum of competition.\u201dChina, Russia, and Iran seek hegemony over spheres of influence. Aware of their weakness against the superpower, they advance strategic goals through unconventional means: hybrid warfare, gray-zone aggression, threats of nuclear escalation, cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, and the reflexive control that limits an adversary\u2019s options before a conflict begins. Meanwhile, American strategic thinking is adrift. \u201cUnfortunately, the innovative operational concepts we need do not currently appear to exist.\u201dReducing defense spending in this environment would be more than foolish. It would be a non sequitur. The Pentagon budget is not the reason for America\u2019s indebtedness. Consider last month\u2019s deficit: revenues were $253 billion and receipts $353 billion for a deficit of $100 billion. Where did the spending go? $69 billion was spent on defense, and $137 billion spent on Social Security and Medicare. That\u2019s close to twice as much on entitlements as on the military. Defense spending is 3 percent of our economy. Interest on the debt \u2014 for which we get nothing but a solid credit rating \u2014 has averaged 2 percent. It may rise to 3 percent by 2027.The debt won\u2019t be fixed until entitlements are. And entitlements won\u2019t be fixed until they absolutely have to be. An irony is that defense spending not only underwrites international security. It also backstops American profligacy. America hasn\u2019t had to reckon with its debt because the dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency. This exorbitant privilege is as likely to be revoked by a national-security crisis as a financial one. That was the case when the dollar replaced the pound sterling, and America supplanted the United Kingdom as the guarantor of international security, at the end of World War II. Not only is defense spending a more effective economic stimulus than transfer payments. By deterring threats and promoting stability, it delays the day of reckoning when America\u2019s accounts will have to be balanced.The Trump administration has identified the enemy: resurgent great powers, most significantly China, whose ultimate objective is disestablishing American preeminence. The administration has also taken the first steps to counter revisionist autocrats by boosting the Pentagon, resuming freedom-of-navigation missions in the South China Sea, sanctioning Russia, opposing Nord Stream 2, and withdrawing from the INF treaty. The beginnings of a long-term strategy of American nationalism can be found in the administration motto that \u201ceconomic security is national security,\u201d and in its focus on the defense-industrial base as the seedbed of American primacy. The National Defense Strategy Commission has 32 policy recommendations of its own. These include cancelling the remaining sequester and continuing increases in the defense budget. That is the very opposite of an across-the-board 5 percent cut.America spent years digging the strategic hole in which it finds itself. We stopped with last year\u2019s defense-appropriation bill. Why start again?
