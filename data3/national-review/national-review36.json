Me, me, me! My, my, my!According to a tally by The American Mirror\u2019s Kyle Olson, Barack Obama\u2019s campaign speech Monday for Nevada Senate Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen referred to himself 92 times in 38 minutes \u2014 or an average self-allusion every 24.7 seconds.When he wasn\u2019t \u201cI\u201d-ing, the former narcissist-in-chief was lying.\u201cUnlike some, I actually try to state facts,\u201d Obama snarked passive-aggressively in a swipe at President Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in just making stuff up. I think you should actually say to people what\u2019s true.\u201dSit down, Mister \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201dThanks to you, my husband, children, and I lost not one, not two, not three but four private individual-market health plans killed directly by Obamacare. Reminder: When the health-insurance cancellation-notice tsunami hit in 2013, liberal Mother Jones magazine sneered that the phenomenon was \u201cphony.\u201d But after 4 million American families received cancellation letters at the end of 2013, Obama\u2019s health-care prevarication was finally deemed the \u201cLie of the Year\u201d by left-leaning PolitiFact.\nAnd five years after promising Americans they could \u201ckeep their doctor\u201d along with their health plan \u201cno matter what,\u201d Obama belatedly \u2019fessed up that \u201cthe average person\u201d would be forced \u201cto have to make some choices, and they might end up having to switch doctors.\u201dFacts, schmacts.Moving on, Obama tried to galvanize voters this week by trashing Trump\u2019s jobs boom: \u201cWhen you hear all this talk about economic miracles right now, remember who started it.\u201dHold up, Mister \u201cJobs are not coming back.\u201d I remember you taunting Trump for needing a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to achieve what you claimed was an unachievable manufacturing industry renaissance \u2014 for which you are now claiming unadulterated credit!I remember you, Mister Multitrillion-Dollar-Stimulus, promising the sun, moon, and stars with the \u201cmost sweeping economic recovery package in our history\u201d that was supposed to lift two million people out of poverty.I recall sky-high unemployment rates for black Americans, nearly double the national rate, and 90 million-plus able-bodied citizens of all colors simply giving up looking for work while wasted billions went to fund crony green-energy boondoggles, bridges to nowhere, renovations to Joe Biden\u2019s favorite Amtrak train station in Delaware, General Services Administration junkets in Las Vegas and Hawaii, ghost congressional districts and stimulus-propaganda road signs planted nationwide and stamped with the shovel-ready logo.Speaking of which, I won\u2019t forget you smirking while you admitted at one of your phony Jobs and Competitiveness Council meetings that \u201cshovel-ready was not as, uh, shovel-ready as we expected.\u201d Yukkity-yuk-yuk.Nor will it go down the memory hole how the Obama administration\u2019s wreckovery lies were enabled by slavering \u201cjournalists\u201d like New York Times columnist David Brooks. He giggled on Jim Lehrer\u2019s PBS show that Obama had told him off the record that the shovel-ready promise was a crock, yet he sat on the truth until his Times colleague Peter Baker reported the admission more than a year later.Wait, we\u2019re not done yet. Astonishingly, Obama is now on the campaign trail comparing the Trump White House to a \u201ctin-pot dictatorship\u201d and calling for a return to \u201cdecency\u201d and \u201clawfulness.\u201dYes, this is the same man who sicced the IRS on tea-party conservatives, evangelicals, and pro-life citizens, amnestied millions of illegal immigrants through executive fiat, appointed dozens of unaccountable and unvetted policy czars, used his Justice Department to spy on journalists, deceived the country over the Benghazi massacre and the Iran deal, demonized his political opponents, and mastered the very social-justice agitation techniques now wielded by left-wing mobs targeting Republicans in every corner of the public square.Thanks, Obama, for reminding America of your miserable legacy of deceit, division, persecution, and redistribution as voters head to the polls. You wanna make the 2018 midterms all about you?
