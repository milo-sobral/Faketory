Shelley wrote the novel, by far her best-known work, when she was just 19, which makes its scope and maturity all the more astonishing.But then, like her creation, Shelley spent her life as a social outsider.Shelley\u2019s father, William Godwin, author of An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793), denounced the Christian doctrine of original sin and argued that man should \u201csupersede and trample upon the institutions of the country in which he lives.\u201d Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), articulated a brand of feminism that, though it may be conservative by today\u2019s standards, was considered dangerous then. And of course, there\u2019s also Shelley\u2019s lover-turned-husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley: a talented poet, a militant atheist, a champion of \u201cfree love,\u201d and, frankly, a nasty piece of work.In short, if you are the company you keep, then Mary Shelley was destined to be radical. Her mother, Wollstonecraft, died shortly after childbirth, infected by the unsterilized hands of her male surgeon (how\u2019s that for a cruel irony?). By the age of 16, she\u2019d eloped to France with Percy Shelley, taking her step-sister, Jane-Claire, along and leaving behind Percy\u2019s wife and two children. Traipsing around Europe, the trio saw foreign lands, cultures, and faces that helped paint the backdrop for Frankenstein.The couple was embroiled in various sexual escapades, no doubt spurred on by close friend Lord Byron, and Mary soon fell pregnant by Percy. In October 1816, her half-sister Fanny, whom the couple paid little attention to before and after her death, killed herself with an overdose of laudanum. In December 1816, the pregnant body of Percy\u2019s wife Harriet was found floating in Serpentine. She left behind a suicide note and Percy\u2019s two children. Weeks later, Percy and Mary were married.Perhaps it would be tempting to consider, as F. Scott Fitzgerald says of Tom and Daisy in The Great Gatsby, that the Shelleys were \u2018\u201ccareless people\u201d who \u201csmashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together.\u201d But in her new biography, In Search of Mary Shelley: The Girl Who Wrote Frankenstein,\u00a0Fiona Sampson maintains that, on the contrary, the Shelleys were highly principled.\nAfter all, Godwin in Political Justice argued that suicide could be rational; Wollstonecraft attempted it herself when abandoned by her lover and Fanny\u2019s father, Gilbert Imlay. Percy Shelley\u2019s \u201cfree love\u201d was perfectly self-explanatory. And Mary, in her defense, was besotted by him. But in other places, Sampson\u2019s scathing disapproval of Percy\u2019s character is barely contained. Born to every kind of privilege, she reminds us, he pursued his own whims and appetites and squandered the happiness of those who cared for him most.Mary Shelley, however, is to be judged by a different standard. Sampson writes that she was \u201ccoached\u201d into her callousness toward Harriet, whom she \u201ctruly\u201d believed to be \u201cin the wrong both politically and personally.\u201d Likewise, her indifference to the plight of Fanny is explained away as a function of her not yet having \u201cdeveloped a capacity for empathy.\u201d And when Percy tried to persuade Mary into a suicide pact, Sampson notes that this might have been \u201cpersuasive to someone like Mary, whose view of love has been shaped by literature and by her own parents\u2019 romantic story.\u201dDoes this narrative do Mary a disservice, I wonder? Was she not a smart, strong woman \u2014 a genius, even \u2014 who knew what she wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to get it? And was she also not, perhaps, a bit cruel and cold-blooded in her treatment of others? Sometimes it\u2019s hard to fathom the elasticity of some feminist readings that bend and break under the weight of their own excuses.That said, Mary certainly had much to contend with. Of the four children she had with Percy, three died in infancy, two of them in the same year. When Percy drowned, he left her a widow and their surviving child fatherless. She received little to no support from her father. No doubt because of these pressures, she was never able to recreate the success of her debut novel despite her obvious talents. And she displayed impossible dignity in the face of such adversity. Here she is writing to her friend Marianne Hunt:May you my dear Marianne never know what it is to loose [sic] two only & lovely children in one year \u2014 to watch their dying moments \u2014 \u00a0then at last to be left childless & forever miserable. It is useless complaining & I shall therefore only write a short letter for as all my thoughts are nothing but misery it is not kind to transmit them to you\u2013Sampson, surveying all of this, concludes generously that:Out of the material we would most of us find overwhelming she created an astonishing life. Despite being born a girl and motherless in her particular time and place, and despite being almost crushed by the \u2018great men\u2019 around her, she produced, while still only a teenager, the novel that uniquely sums up the restless, experimental spirit of her Romantic times. She changed the face of fiction; she has challenged every \u2018modern\u2019 generation since she wrote her first novel to explore both empirical science and moral philosophy; and in the hubristic researcher Frankenstein and his creature, the nearly human of our nightmares, she created two enduring archetypes.If Sampson\u2019s aim is to make Shelley fascinating and endearing despite her most glaring flaws, her most catastrophic \u201cprinciples,\u201d this book is largely a success. But she really needn\u2019t have tried so hard. The nature of Mary\u2019s life, the torment, the bad decisions, the frustrated talents, are as manifest in her life as in her most famous work. Still, Sampson provides a stylish portrait of the young writer, illuminating the origin of Frankenstein and ensuring that Shelley is not, like her most famous creation, \u201cborne away by the waves and lost in distance and darkness.\u201dNR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
