We\u2019ve seen this movie before. We know what\u2019s going to happen next, and none of it is good. Everything about our polarization is about to get worse.First \u2014 on the left \u2014 even before the evidence is in, the conventional wisdom will harden that the attacks were Donald Trump\u2019s fault (or at least that his rhetoric played a role), and that any concerns about Democratic mobs or Democratic violence represent a frivolous and bad-faith diversion from the imperative of opposing the real enemy. As Andy McCarthy notes, mainstream news organizations are already pointedly stating that the targets of the attack are also targets of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker:Statement from CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker: pic.twitter.com/OXyIT6oSLT\u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) October 24, 2018Yes, words matter, but it\u2019s worth repeating that we don\u2019t have any evidence at all that Trump\u2019s words matter to the bomber. Yet for some, regardless of the evidence emerges in the next several days, Trump\u2019s responsibility will remain an unfalsifiable belief \u2014 much in the same way that the New York Times editorial board just last year blamed Sarah Palin for inciting the terrible mass shooting in Tuscon that grievously injured Gabbie Giffords \u2014 long after claims of Palin\u2019s alleged incitement had been thoroughly debunked.Second \u2014 on the right \u2014 if it turns out that the bomber is in fact a MAGA-hat wearing Trump fanatic, look for an avalanche of \u201cwhat-abouts.\u201d What about Steve Scalise? What about the ricin threat against Susan Collins? What about the man arrested for threatening Republican senators over Kavanaugh? There\u2019s value in these what-abouts if a person argues that violence is the exclusive province of one side of the debate. They\u2019re poisonous if they\u2019re used to avoid looking at your own movement in the mirror.In political movements, the most effective policing is often self-policing, and yet that is now seen as a sign of weakness. In fact, the imperative to immediately fight back (and the hatred that drives one to feel that imperative the instant you see even your fellow citizens under threat) has already led a number of people on the right to recklessly and without any evidence either insinuate or claim outright that leftists are behind the bombs. For example, Candace Owens tweeted (and then deleted),\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and state that there is a 0% chance that these \u201csuspicious packages\u201d were sent out by conservatives. The only thing \u2018suspicious\u2019 about these packages, is their timing. Caravans, fake bomb threats \u2014 these leftists are going ALL OUT for midterms.\u201dAnd there\u2019s this nonsense from Dinesh D\u2019Souza:NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.I hear the FBI squeezed lemon juice on the suspicious packages and a very faint lettering revealed a single word: DEMOCRATS\u2014 Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) October 24, 2018While there will always be some small number of cranks and extremists who want to commit acts of violence regardless of the tone of political discourse, vicious and angry rhetoric can have a malignant effect on troubled souls, granting them a level of moral permission to act beyond the law. Few things grant that permission more thoroughly than the belief that the other side wants you dead. We live in a political culture that magnifies the other side\u2019s violence even as it minimizes our own team\u2019s misconduct as marginal and rare. Can we not see where that leads?We are still blessed with relative political peace. But we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves. That can change. The late Sixties and early Seventies saw a surge of political violence on a scale that would shock the conscience of Americans today. We do not want to walk down that road. That level of violence, amplified through social media, could very well break our nation. So it\u2019s imperative that we restrain our rhetoric, wait for evidence, and then have the moral courage to follow that evidence wherever it takes us \u2014 even to the darkest places in our own political movements.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
