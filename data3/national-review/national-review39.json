Jennifer Wexton, a Democratic state senator in Virginia running against Republican representative Barbara Comstock, has an ad in heavy rotation that deserves some sort of prize for going above and beyond the call of duty in trying to fool voters.The ad tries to tie Comstock to President Trump on health care. Potentially its most damaging hit portrays Comstock as an opponent of protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Here\u2019s how the ad handles the issue: It says that Trump is against such protections, says that Comstock usually votes with Trump, and concludes that she\u2019s therefore against the protections too. Never mind that Comstock voted against the House version of the Republican health-care bill last year, saying among other things that it contained inadequate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.It\u2019s well within bounds to attack Comstock for voting \u201cwith Trump\u201d too often \u2014 although the statistic used to make that case is fairly meaningless \u2014 and even to label her \u201cBarbara Trumpstock.\u201d (Nothing says you hate Trump like using a juvenile nickname, I guess.) But you\u2019d think, if you wanted to nail Comstock for agreeing with Trump and being out of step with her district, you\u2019d pick an issue on which she, you know, agreed with Trump and was out of step with her district. Instead the ad pretends that she takes the opposite position from the one she does, in order to further its narrative. (\u201cBarbara Trumpstock agrees,\u201d the ad claims, after laying out Trump\u2019s positions.)Wexton is lying on this issue, and based on my recent TV viewing, she\u2019s lying multiple times an hour.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
