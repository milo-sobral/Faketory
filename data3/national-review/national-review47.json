Now physical book sales are on the rise and cellphones appear to be eating e-readers\u2019 lunch. Yet a hot new format is physical, printed books that mimic certain aspects of cellphones. As usual with disturbing trends, you may blame the youth.In the Netherlands, where these things are taking off, they are called dwarsliggers. (Yet another reason not to allow your kids to visit Amsterdam.) They\u2019re books the size of cellphones. When you open them you find you have to turn them lengthwise to read them. The pages are as thin as onionskin. They\u2019re designed to be read with one hand, the pages turned by one skilled thumb.Some 10 million of these have been sold in Europe (where people are far more likely to read books while packed together on trains, I think) and now one U.S. publisher is giving them a shot. The reduced size does not come with a reduced price, though: They\u2019re $12. To me they look like a gag from Matt Damon\u2019s Alexander Payne movie Downsizing. I doubt miniature books will catch on. But if they do I suppose they\u2019d look great left casually on the dashboard of your Mini Cooper.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
