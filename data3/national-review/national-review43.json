He does, and how. But \u2014 and this is the bit that Cillizza misses \u2014 so does every other politician in the United States. \u201cFear,\u201d it seems, conjugates in much the same way as do \u201cpolitics\u201d and \u201cdivisiveness\u201d: I run on hope, you run on fear; I do what\u2019s right, you do what\u2019s political; If we all agreed with my plan we\u2019d be united; that you want us to agree with yours makes you divisive. And so on.One does not need to be a political junkie to have noticed that the Democratic party is, at present, somewhere close to fever pitch in its campaign against President Trump, whom, over the last couple of years, it has cast variously as the second coming of Adolf Hitler, George Wallace, Andrew Jackson, and more. Nor does one have to be especially switched on to have observed that, in 2018, hyperbolic language is by no means the sole preserve of the Republican party. Last year, Nancy Pelosi described the GOP\u2019s proposed healthcare bill as \u201cdeath\u201d and its tax bill as \u201cArmageddon,\u201d while Hillary Clinton argued that \u201cif Republicans pass this bill, they\u2019re the death party\u201d and Bernie Sanders predicted that 36,000 people per year would die yearly if Obamacare were repealed. A month ago, Terry McAuliffe warned that \u201cthe nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come,\u201d while senators within his party ranged from advising voters that Kavanaugh would destroy the United States Constitution in toto to repeating allegations that he was a gang-rapist. In recent weeks, Hillary Clinton has taken to arguing that \u201cour democracy is in crisis\u201d and that this midterm election is \u201cour last chance\u201d to save it, and, in so doing, echoed the \u201cFlight 93\u201d language that many of Trump\u2019s supporters used to justify his excesses last time around.And here\u2019s the thing: None of these people are breaking with tradition. In 2012, Joe Biden told a room full of African-Americans that Mitt Romney wanted to put them \u201cback in chains,\u201d while pro-Obama campaign commercials accused Romney of killing a woman with cancer and cast him as \u201cnot one of us.\u201d Paul Ryan, for his part, was shown pushing elderly women over cliffs. The Republican party since 2010 has been called everything under the sun: terrorists, bomb-throwers, hostage-takers, neo-Confederates, you name it.As I write, Andrew Gillum is running around Florida suggesting that his opponent is a racist who is fine with slavery, and that Floridians must \u201cget out there and vote like your lives depend on it . . . because your lives do depend on who the next governor is.\u201d\u00a0Somehow, I doubt we will see Chris Cillizza running \u201cAndrew Gillum wants you to be scared at the ballot box\u201d headlines. Why not? Well, because despite\u00a0Cillizza\u2019s insistence that reporters don\u2019t \u201croot for a side,\u201d most of them do, in fact, root for a side, even if they can\u2019t see it. And when you root for a side it becomes more difficult to see things from the other side\u2019s perspective or to grasp that the guy you like is also fear-mongering and overemphasizing. It feels natural to suggest that your plan would \u201cunify\u201d because, unlike the dissenters, you wouldn\u2019t have to give up anything up if it were implemented. For the same reason, it feels normal to suggest that the policies that you believe work are just \u201cpolicies that work,\u201d and that the people who disagree with you are motivated by fear, and that America would be united if only those who disagreed with you would go live somewhere else. None of us, after all, want to consider ourselves divisive, political, or scared.But we are those things \u2014 and, sometimes, with good reason. \u201cUnity\u201d is not only an unattainable state in a free country such as the United States, but it should be\u00a0an unattainable state. Yes, there are some elementary questions on which we should all be able to agree, but on most issues beyond the basics we will not \u2014 and we should not, because if we did we would be suppressing dissent. Worse still, we would be suppressing dissent while reassuring the suppressed that they were better off for it.There is nothing intrinsically wrong with \u201cpolitics\u201d or \u201cdivision\u201d in a country in which the people are as politically divided as Americans are at the moment,\u00a0especially\u00a0when one considers the alternative, which is war. We have \u201cpolitics\u201d because we do not want to kill each other over every question of national import. This may not be a perfect system \u2014 and it may especially irritate the people who believe that they have been ordained to make all the important decisions on our behalf \u2014 but it is a lot better than the other option, which is widespread death and destruction. Now, as during most of American history, Americans have differing visions as to how their affairs should be organized. Add in that we now have a culture that elevates almost all issues to the national stage a central government that has taken over most of the functions of the states, and a social-media environment that rewards distortions and punishes nuance, and it is natural that our elections \u2014 which play the role of battles in the unlovely alternative \u2014 will be marked by fear, exaggeration, and opportunism. There are many things wrong with Donald Trump, including some of the campaign choices he reflexively makes. But he did not invent fear \u2014 or politics, either.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
