Bush did. The shift among Democrats gets less attention but is no less real, as I write in Bloomberg Opinion:As is often the case, the evolution of Democratic attitudes can also be seen by tracking Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments over the years. When she first ran for president, from 2006 through 2008, she was careful to take a moderate tack. She\u00a0opposed\u00a0giving driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants, came out for \u201ctougher employer sanctions\u201d to deter the hiring of illegal immigrants, and\u00a0toggled\u00a0between calling them \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants.The Democratic shift, I go on to argue, created a political opportunity for Republicans, who could either lower the costs of their own departures from the views of middle-of-the-road voters or take the center ground on the issue away from Democrats.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
