He is making frantic efforts to explode that old reputation. One day he rails against Jeff Sessions, with whom he used to co-sponsor legislation, as an enemy of civil rights. Another he insists, contrary to evidence, that he is breaking Senate rules to fight Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.And now he\u2019s proposing a sweeping program of wealth redistribution, one that would raise estate taxes to their highest level in decades in order to put the money in accounts for children from households that make up to five times the poverty level. (The higher the household income, the lower the yearly deposit.) Booker is touting this idea as a way of boosting saving \u2014 but on a national level, it can only reduce saving, since it diminishes the incentive to save.If you\u2019re rich, the estate tax is a reason to invest in economically unproductive estate planning or to spend the money rather than hand it on. Booker\u2019s 65 percent rate \u2014 a significantly higher rate, by the way, than any advanced country levies \u2014 would be a much stronger reason to do either than today\u2019s 40 percent rate. (The effective rate would be even higher than 65 percent because of other changes Booker proposes.) Because that rate would apply only to the very largest estates \u2014 for married couples, it would kick in at $100 million \u2014 it would affect the behavior of a small slice of the population, it is true; but it is the slice that does a disproportionate amount of the country\u2019s saving. A lower rate of national saving will in the long run mean a smaller economy, with lower wages, than we would otherwise have had.The estate tax is also widely disliked, much to the dismay of progressives. A 2017 poll found that 65 percent of the public wants to abolish the estate tax \u2014 and 76 percent wants to abolish it if it\u2019s labeled the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d But then Booker isn\u2019t playing to most Americans right now, just to left-wingers who hold disproportionate sway in the Democratic party. If only there were a way to redistribute their political influence.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
