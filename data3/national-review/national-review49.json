The United States will secure its border and enforce its immigration laws. In accordance with those laws, it will summarily deport illegal entrants and interpret its asylum statutes in accordance with their meaning and purpose. If you do complete the journey, you will not be released into the American interior but instead held at the border. Rather than risk a fruitless journey, it is better to turn back now.To Americans, the message is equally clear. There is no cause for alarm. To the extent that members of the migrant caravan do complete their trek through Mexico, they will not be permitted to storm border crossings, and we have sufficient resources to secure our border and enforce our laws. We will apply those laws fairly and treat migrants humanely, but we will apply the law.In other words, we can handle this. The migrant caravan is not an emergency. In fact, unless and until it gets hundreds of miles closer (while still retaining its size), there\u2019s not even all that much cause for concern. Even if it arrives in some strength, there is no way for a group that size to sneak across the border, and the most powerful nation in the world has more than enough resources to meet the migrants when they attempt to cross, detain them, and begin the necessary legal proceedings.It would be a challenge, but (again) not an emergency. And as the caravan marches north \u2014 shedding people along the way \u2014 the president (and his allies) should be able to make a calm, compelling argument for national borders and the rule of law.Or they could publicly panic.\nHonestly, it\u2019s hard to think of a response less measured and more effective at undermining moderate support for immigration restrictions than the reaction of the president and key allies. The president\u2019s tweets have conveyed extraordinary alarm. Here are some selected entries:Sadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2018Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018Then, just yesterday alone, on Fox News and Fox Business, guests raised truly absurd claims about the diseases the migrants might bring to the U.S., including leprosy, a polio-like disease, and smallpox. In case you were wondering, smallpox has been eradicated for decades, and the last known smallpox death was in 1978.Just now a Fox News guest says the migrants may have \"leprosy\" and warns that \"they're gonna infect our people in the United States\" pic.twitter.com/uflfjVJbc2\u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 29, 2018Lou Dobbs' guest blames \"the continued invasion of this country\" by immigrants for \"diseases spreading across the country that are causing polio-like paralysis of our children\" pic.twitter.com/DM9a1sKNXX\u2014 Brendan Karet \ud83d\udeae (@bad_takes) October 30, 2018And now the Pentagon is planning to send thousands of troops to the border, a military buildup that may soon match or even exceed American deployments to Iraq.Moreover, it may well be an extraordinary waste of resources. Trump is creating the impression that the Army will protect America\u2019s borders, but it doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to enforce American law. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military in a law-enforcement role. Consequently, the troops will act not \u2014 as Trump describes in his tweet \u2014 as a military force responding to \u201cinvaders\u201d but instead as mere logistical support for conventional federal law enforcement.As a result of this rhetoric and the dramatic military deployment, we have Americans who are convinced that our border crossings are about to stormed by \u201cinvaders\u201d who carry disease and harbor criminals (and possibly terrorists). Conversely, we have another set of Americans who are now more able to caricature the restrictionist position on immigration as driven by hysterical fear \u2014 and not just by referring to random right-wing firebrands but by quoting the president of United States and multiple guests on his adored television network.Moreover, the president\u2019s words actually fuel the caravan and empower left-wing immigration activists. Absent his unrelenting attention, would the caravan be swarming with reporters? Absent his unrelenting attention, would it be drawing the eyes of the world?Yet that\u2019s when the president\u2019s defenders argue that he\u2019s crazy like a fox. He\u2019s baited the Left, you see, into staking out an extreme position on immigration and on backing potential border chaos that moderate Americans would reject. And they have a point. It is true that the laws of negative polarization are working their magic. Extreme rhetoric is all too often countered by extreme rhetoric on the other side. Witness former Republican strategist Steve Schmidt liken the caravan to the \u201cReichstag fire\u201d (to which MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes immediately replies, \u201cYeah.\u201d).On the Chris Hayes Show, Steve Schmidt unloaded on the \"right-wing propaganda industry\" radicalizing evil losers, compared it to ISIS. He also compared Trump's migrant caravan lies to the Reichstag fire lies that helped establish Nazi Germany. Dude did not hold back. pic.twitter.com/UPnOtVGWEY\u2014 Adam Best (@adamcbest) October 30, 2018That\u2019s a vile assertion. But to exult in triggering extremism is to exult in further polarization, and triggering extremism is much less amusing if the opposing extremist wins an election. In the days before a key midterm, Trump is gambling on panic. That\u2019s not a good look for a president. It\u2019s not good for the country. And it\u2019s terrible for the state of the American immigration debate. The president may never calm down, but his supporters (and members of his administration) can and should.We can protect American borders by telling the truth and applying the law. It\u2019s an approach that will work in the short term, and it\u2019s an approach that will win in the long term. It\u2019s time we gave it a try.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
