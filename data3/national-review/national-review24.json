The words \u201cHEIL TRUMP\u201d were painted on an Episcopal church in Bean Blossom, Ind. Tongues were clucked, tuts were tutted, and the culprit turned out to be the church\u2019s liberal staff organist, David Stang. \u201cStang stated that he wanted to mobilize a movement after being disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election,\u201d said Theodore Adams, a local prosecutor.Raising awareness \u2014 it is a dangerous business.Fake hate crimes have become so common on college campuses and among young progressives that every time I read about a racist note being sent to a lefty student or somebody getting assaulted over Brexit politics on the mean streets of Ann Arbor, I assume it\u2019s a hoax. And, as it turns out, that\u2019s often been the case in the past several years. And it\u2019s always about raising awareness \u2014 dishonesty in the service of truth. After a fake anti-Muslim hate crime at Indiana State University, Assistant Professor Azhar Hussain was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and harassment. According to the local police chief: \u201cIt is our belief Hussain was trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself.\u201dNR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.Jonah has been all over \u201clying for justice\u201d for years. And it\u2019s important that we confront \u2014 and remember \u2014 those lies. People trying to derail Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court claimed he was a serial gang rapist, a pure fabrication and an obvious one. When David French began to question the story, he was ridiculed and dismissed by Bill Weir of CNN, Matthew Dowd of ABC News, Josh Moon of the Alabama Political Reporter, and others, none of whom is looking too smart in retrospect. Our environmentalist friends defend to this day Stephen Schneider\u2019s insistence that scientists must \u201cdecide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest\u201d when working to \u201ccapture the public\u2019s imagination\u201d and recruit them to the cause of combatting climate change. (Schneider and others insist the quote was \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d See for yourself whether that is convincing.)Lena Dunham fabricated a story about being raped by a campus Republican at Oberlin in order to make a political and cultural point; Rolling Stone published a fabricated story about a rape at the University of Virginia, one concocted to touch the same cultural buttons. This sort of thing appeals to progressives because their strategy is not to debate but to discredit. Dianne Feinstein is not going to win a debate with Brett Kavanaugh on constitutional interpretation \u2014 the Left had far better chances trying to smear him as a habitual gang rapist.I have no idea who is behind these pipe bombs. I assume it\u2019s somebody who hates Democrats and CNN for the same reason seeing hoof prints makes me think there\u2019s a horse around, rather than a zebra. But there are zebras in the world.The legacy of all these fake hate crimes and sexual assaults is that it is no longer unfair or unreasonable to consider the possibility of a hoax when reading about incidents such as these. \u201cLying for justice\u201d has corroded and debased our public discourse, and that\u2019s done more damage than these pipe bombs did, whoever sent them.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
