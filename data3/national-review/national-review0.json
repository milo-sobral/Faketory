My guests are David French and Vivek Dave. We \u2014 they, really, as I kind of officiate and enjoy \u2014 talk about the Major League Baseball playoffs, which we are deep into. The World Series starts on Tuesday. Also, the NBA season has just started. What should we expect? How far will LeBron James take the Los Angeles Lakers?We further talk about college football, which we\u2019re in the middle of. And the new NFL season, which we\u2019re in the middle of. Both have been great. By the way, there\u2019s a new biography of Bill Belichick, whose subtitle declares him \u201cthe greatest football coach of all time.\u201d Is that true? Not according to David. \u201cNick Saban called and he wants his title back.\u201d David and Vivek have a lively exchange on this subject, and others.The whole podcast is a joy, from my point of view. At the end, we ask, Why sports? What does sports do for us? Many things, is the answer, and David and Vivek detail some of those, eloquently and even movingly. Again, here.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
