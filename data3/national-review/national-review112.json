Soon enough, I found the source of their concern. A terribly mistaken article from ABC News. In describing the Department of Education\u2019s proposed Title IX rule changes to sexual-assault adjudication standards (I wrote about them today on the home page), ABC says this:One of the biggest changes to the rule would be a new definition of sexual harassment. Under Obama, it was defined it as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.\u201d The new rule would define sexual harassment as unwanted sexual conduct that is \u201cso severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201dThat definition would be significantly more difficult to prove because the victim would have to prove the misconduct prevents them from returning to school.No. The latter statement is completely wrong. The \u201cnew\u201d rule is based on an almost 20-year-old Supreme Court case, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, and is a restatement of standard sexual-harassment law. My friend Ken White explains:Basically, the \"so severe or pervasive\" is standard harassment law language.  it does not require literally preventing the person from returning.  It requires proof that the harassment is so frequent or bad that it alters the nature of employment/schooling.\u2014 WhatCouldGoWrongHat (@Popehat) November 16, 2018The proposed rule defines sexual harassment as sexual assault, quid pro quo harassment, and as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Note that the standard does not require you to prove that you lack \u201caccess\u201d to the educational program. You merely have to prove that you lack equal access \u2014 that your access to the program or activity is fundamentally tainted by harassment.A rule that required women to prove that misconduct \u201cprevents them from returning to school\u201d would be outrageous and would permit a host of dreadful actions that oppressed women but not enough to chase them from campus. Thankfully that\u2019s not the law.But that\u2019s not the only problem with ABC\u2019s story. It also describes the motivation for the changes like this:A small group of mens\u2019 rights groups have pushed for the changes, contending that schools have gone too far and provided little due process to the accused. That criticism has resonated with several White House supporters, including President Donald Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who has said he\u2019s more worried about his sons than to his daughters in the #MeToo era.That statement drastically understates the scale of the problem and the identity of those seeking change. Courts have faced waves of litigation, and judges from coast-to-coast and across the ideological spectrum have issued dozens of adverse rulings against universities. Coalitions of law professors from places like Harvard and Penn have expressed concerns about the lack of due process on campus. The Atlantic\u2018s Emily Yoffe has written an invaluable series of articles outlining the serious problems with campus sexual assault adjudications. This was no fringe movement. It was constitutionally necessary.ABC should revise its inaccurate report. It\u2019s causing unnecessary concern about an already-contentious topic.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
