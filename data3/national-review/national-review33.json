The first, conducted by Florida Atlantic University over this past weekend, showed Scott ahead of Nelson 42-41 percent, with 13 percent of voters undecided. The second, conducted by Gravis this past Monday and Tuesday, found Nelson leading Scott 49-45 percent, with 7 percent undecided. Each poll surveyed about 750 likely voters.According to the Gravis poll, 48 percent of Florida voters either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d approve of Nelson\u2019s job performance in the Senate, while 52 percent say the same of Scott\u2019s performance as governor, and 50 percent\u00a0say the same of President Donald Trump.These latest divergent results come on the heels of several polls that likewise offer observers little to go on. Quinnipiac put Nelson up by seven points and CNN gave him a five-point lead, while St. Pete Polls found Scott leading Nelson by one point. Meanwhile, Nelson leads Scott by 3.5 points in the RealClearPolitics\u00a0average.Overall, the edge seems to belong to the Democratic incumbent. In the surveys where Nelson is ahead of his GOP competitor, he tends to be up by several points, while the polling advantages accorded to Scott are usually a slimmer margin of one or two percentage points.\u00a0Even so, the race certainly remains a tossup, and Democrats shouldn\u2019t consider Nelson out of the woods.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
