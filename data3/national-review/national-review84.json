On November 3, when Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson mocked Texas Republican Dan Crenshaw\u2019s eye patch, saying he looked like a \u201chit man in a porno movie\u201d \u2014 then adding, \u201cI know he lost his eye in war or whatever\u201d \u2014 it was a gift from the partisan gods.A liberal comic had gone too far. He had mocked a man who was maimed in a horrific IED attack, an attack that had taken the life of his interpreter and nearly blinded him for life. He mocked a courageous man\u2019s pain. And thus Crenshaw had attained the rarest position for a Republican politician: aggrieved-victim status. He was free to swing away.Instead, he refused to be offended. He noted that the joke was bad, but his handling of the whole affair was \u2014 as the Washington Post described him \u2014 \u201ccool as a cucumber.\u201d Then Saturday Night Live called. The show wanted to apologize, and they wanted Crenshaw on-air. He said yes, and this happened:It was the act of grace heard \u2019round the nation. Davidson came on the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d set and offered his apology, and then Crenshaw joined. He took some good-natured shots at Davidson \u2014 Crenshaw\u2019s phone had an Ariana Grande ringtone (Grande recently broke her engagement with Davidson), and he mocked Davidson\u2019s appearance \u2014 but then things took a more serious turn.Crenshaw briefly spoke of the meaning of the words \u201cnever forget\u201d to a veteran, saying that \u201cwhen you say \u2018never forget\u2019 to a veteran, you are implying that, as an American, you are in it with them.\u201d Then he addressed his next words to Davidson: \u201cAnd never forget those we lost on 9/11 \u2014 heroes like Pete\u2019s father. So I\u2019ll just say, Pete, never forget.\u201d\nDavidson\u2019s father was a firefighter. He died trying to save others when Davidson was a young boy. In one moment, Crenshaw not only honored a true hero, but also softened American hearts towards Davidson, casting him in a new light. He\u2019s a man who carries his own pain.It turns out that there\u2019s a market for grace in American politics. Within minutes, clips of the apology and Crenshaw\u2019s tribute to Davidson\u2019s dad rocketed across Twitter. As of this morning, the YouTube clip of the moment \u2014 not even 48 hours old \u2014 already had more than 5 million views. And it seems as if this is no act. This act of grace was an expression of who Crenshaw is.In a long Washington Post profile, Crenshaw spoke of the distinct trail he wants to blaze in the age of Trump. Speaking of the president, he said, \u201cHis style is not my style. I\u2019ll just say that. It\u2019s never how I would conduct myself. But what readers of the Washington Post need to understand is that conservatives can hold multiple ideas in their head at the same time. We can be like, \u2018Wow, he shouldn\u2019t have tweeted that,\u2019 and still support him. . . . You can disapprove of what the president says every day, or that day, and still support his broader agenda.\u201dCrenshaw\u2019s young. He\u2019s 34. And that means that he stands a good chance of being in Washington long after Donald Trump is gone. If he\u2019s a voice of the post-Trump GOP, then perhaps the future isn\u2019t as bleak as critics may fear.There are those who argued before the election that, to punish the GOP for Trump, even conservatives should vote against Crenshaw. Vote against a good man for the sake of beating a bad man not on the ballot. That would \u201csend a message,\u201d they said.But it turns out that one of the messages we needed to hear came from Crenshaw himself. Even in the age of Trump, a Republican politician can be his own man. He can show that grace isn\u2019t weakness and that reconciliation can sometimes be more compelling than division.As the Post noted in its profile, Crenshaw is at the very start of his \u201cnext mission.\u201d He\u2019ll face the bitter cynicism of Washington, the drudgery of daily politics, and the festering divisions in a polarized capital. His future is not yet known. But when faced with a clear political temptation \u2014 to indulge in a period of partisan pugilism \u2014 he chose a different path. He (and Davidson) gave Americans a moment they needed. It turns out it was also a moment they wanted.Crenshaw\u2019s next mission, then, is off to a very good start.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
