Turner in European Intellectual History from Rousseau to Nietzsche, \u201cwho made the hatred of one\u2019s own culture the stance of the cultivated person.\u201d The Rousseau of Arizona is the alternately contemptuous and clownish Kyrsten Sinema, who is trying to persuade Arizonans to overlook her well-documented contempt for the state and tap her to be one of its two U.S. senators.Sinema, a bisexual former social worker and criminal-defense lawyer who toiled for Ralph Nader\u2019s radical Green party in 2000 and acknowledged being a \u201cbomb thrower\u201d when first elected to the Arizona state legislature in 2004, has also called herself a \u201cPrada socialist.\u201d Today she plays a cautious congresswoman, seemingly intent on following the path of Kirsten Gillibrand, a New Yorker who logged a centrist record in the House while representing a somewhat conservative district but shifted hard left when she was appointed to the Senate. Sinema has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 so extreme that even CNN pointed out that her positions \u201cfrequently brought her into contact with the left-wing fringe.\u201d Among that fringe, despising ordinary Americans is a hilarious bonding ritual. Even mocking one\u2019s own state is seen as a way of scoring points with the right-minded.In a 2010 speech to a gathering called Netroots Nation, sometimes dubbed \u201cNutroots Nation\u201d for the fever it inspires in cranks, extremists, and eccentrics, Sinema cheerfully quoted a Daily Show quip and called Arizona the \u201cmeth lab of democracy.\u201d (Isn\u2019t that supposed to be New Mexico? Has any Daily Show writer ever set foot in either state?) \u201cI\u2019m happy to steal it and use it all the time,\u201d she said then.The majority of Arizona men tend to vote conservative, but Sinema derided such folks as \u201cNeanderthals.\u201d As for the state\u2019s stay-at-home moms, Sinema launched a bizarre attack on them: \u201cThese women who act like staying at home, leeching off their husbands or boyfriends, and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they\u2019re choosing to live that life. That\u2019s bullsh**. I mean, what the f*** are we really talking about here?\u201d she said in 2006. Stay-at-home mothers might respond that what they are talking about is the significant work that goes into making a household and a family operate, and that such labor is hardly \u201cleeching.\u201dSinema has attempted to cast her notorious anti-war speech in a pink tutu for the activist group Local to Global Justice in 2003 as merely an honorable anti-war statement. Yet the flyer this group \u2014 which she co-founded \u2014 distributed to promote the rally she organized and of which she was listed as the point of contact depicted U.S. soldiers as ghoulish skeletons. It noted, \u201cYou can help us push back U.S. terror in Iraq and the Middle East.\u201d PolitiFact, in one of its more embarrassing instances of carrying water for Democrats, said none of this indicated Sinema\u2019s disrespect for U.S. troops, citing the congresswoman\u2019s claim that she did not \u201capprove or design the flyers.\u201d No, she merely led the group that distributed them.It\u2019s not like Sinema\u2019s truthfulness hasn\u2019t been called into question on other occasions. Central to her biography is her tall tale about having been \u201chomeless\u201d with her family in Florida for nearly three years. She wasn\u2019t homeless. She lived in a cinderblock building that had once been a gas station, then a country store. She has claimed the dwelling had no running water or electricity. Really? When she told the Washington Post \u201cwe had a toilet,\u201d the Post noted drily, \u201cHow that toilet was flushed with no running water, she wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d When asked how the family prepared food, Sinema hesitated, said the Post. \u201cYou know, you could make fires,\u201d she added. Sure, Kyrsten. When the New York Times pointed out that Sinema\u2019s parents had told a judge at the time they were paying monthly bills for gas, electricity, and phone service, making it unlikely that they had had no access to these things, Sinema replied, \u201cOh gosh, I don\u2019t have an answer for that.\u201d In the Washington Post, her step-aunt said of Sinema\u2019s hard-luck story: \u201cI realize this tugs at people\u2019s heartstrings and that was what she was going for, but, you know, it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d\nWhat is the truth is that Sinema has a long history of nauseating ideology. She called Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush \u201cthe real Saddam and Osama lovers\u201d in a 2003 op-ed, and when an interviewer asked how she\u2019d react if he joined the Taliban, her response was: \u201cFine. I don\u2019t care if you want to do that; go ahead.\u201d Joining the Taliban isn\u2019t actually fine. It would be treasonous. When Martha McSally, the Harvard-trained retired Air Force colonel and fighter pilot who is the Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona, said so, Sinema whined that it was a \u201csmear.\u201d As for Sinema\u2019s supposedly principled opposition to war, it isn\u2019t so principled as all that. She has called for U.S. military intervention in Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda.Sinema\u2019s admiration for Arizonans and for U.S. troops might appear questionable, but she does have a soft spot for witches. She warmly invited sisters of the coven to her Code Pink protest in 2003 and wrote, of another anti-war rally in Miami, that she spent it \u201csinging and spiraling in the pagan\u2019s circle only 5 rows back from the police line.\u201d Save it for Stevie Nicks tribute night down at the local pagan pub. Raised Mormon, Sinema no longer counts herself a member of the LDS church and has said, \u201cI am not a member of any faith community.\u201d Why sell yourself short, Kyrsten? Nicks-Wicca is a kind of faith. All that singing and spiraling! Whether it\u2019s becoming of a U.S. senator to have such a silly record is another question. Sinema seems like a twisted Daily Show parody of the values represented by Arizona\u2019s recently departed senator, John McCain. It would be a disgrace to his memory if a far-left dingbat witchy-poo anti-war protester came to serve his state in the United States Senate.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
