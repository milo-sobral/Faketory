That\u2019s understandable \u2014 it\u2019s fairly new, after all. But you can fix that here.For those who don\u2019t like hyperlinks, I\u2019ll explain it myself. NRPlus is NR\u2019s new digital membership service. Among other things, NRPlus members get full digital access to the magazine and its digital archives; get to listen to every episode within NR\u2019s growing podcast archive; get rid of up to 90 percent of the advertisements on NationalReview.com; get to comment on all posts; and, best of all, get to join NR\u2019s members-only Facebook group and connect with NR\u2019s writers, and readers (just yesterday, Jonah Goldberg did an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d for the group). Moreover, NRPlus members get around the paywall, so they\u2019ll never miss another article.NR has always been a family as much as a magazine, and NRPlus is perhaps the best available way to become part of that family. You can find all the information you need here.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
