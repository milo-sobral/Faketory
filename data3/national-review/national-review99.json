When his supply was stolen from his car, he believed the thief was his cousin Emmitt, 19. Chandler fatally shot Emmitt and fled the scene, but later that night he surrendered to authorities. Convicted of murder, Chandler was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.\u00a0Parents who have raised sons understand that civilization\u2019s primary task is to civilize adolescent males, a task that is difficult for many reasons, some of which neuroscience explains. The part of the brain that stimulates anger and aggression is larger in males than in females (for evolutionary, meaning adaptive, reasons). And the part that restrains anger is smaller in males. The Supreme Court has noted that adolescent brain anatomy can cause \u201ctransient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences,\u201d thereby diminishing \u201cmoral culpability\u201d and, more important, enhancing \u201cthe prospect that, as the years go by,\u201d offenders\u2019 \u201cdeficiencies will be reformed.\u201d Hence \u201ca lifetime in prison is a disproportionate sentence for all but the rarest of children, those whose crimes reflect \u2018irreparable corruption.'\u201d\u00a0There is spirited disagreement among thoughtful people concerning whether such disproportion constitutes a violation of the Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment proscription of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d There is disagreement concerning whether the Eighth Amendment as originally understood by those who wrote and ratified it was intended to forbid only certain methods of punishment, or to assign to courts the task of\u00a0enunciating standards of proportionality in sentencing. There is disagreement about what the modern court has done in incrementally circumscribing states\u2019 discretion in punishing juveniles: It has held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital punishment for children under 18. And that it forbids life imprisonment without parole for juveniles convicted of non-homicide offenses. And that it forbids \u2014 this is the issue in Chandler\u2019s case \u2014 mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders unless they have demonstrated \u201csuch irretrievable depravity that rehabilitation is impossible.\u201d\u00a0Never mind that it is difficult to imagine how a sentencing court could determine that a juvenile has manifested such depravity. Clearly, however, the Mississippi court that heard Chandler\u2019s argument for resentencing in light of Supreme Court rulings about sentencing juveniles did not seriously attempt this difficult task.\u00a0\nWhile incarcerated, Chandler has not been a discipline problem. He has earned a GED and completed college-level coursework in Bible studies. He has earned certificates in construction trade skills and made substantial progress toward a certificate in automotive repair. Nevertheless, the resentencing court\u2019s almost flippant reasons for reaffirming Chandler\u2019s sentence to die in prison included the following:\u00a0\u201cNothing in the record\u201d suggested that Chandler \u201csuffered from a lack of maturity\u201d when he shot his cousin. (Science demonstrates a physiological basis of varying maturities of male adolescents.) The 17-year-old Chandler was \u201cvery mature\u201d because he planned his crime. (His prompt surrender suggests more bewilderment than planning.) He was mature because he came from a nuclear family. (How does a family\u2019s attribute prove the existence of a different attribute in a family member?) He was mature because 17-year-olds are allowed to get driver\u2019s and pilot\u2019s licenses, and abortions, and because he fathered a child, and because in World War II a 17-year-old won a Medal of Honor.\u00a0Really. And the court simply ignored the evidence of Chandler\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation.\u00a0Fifty years ago, many Americans thought Mississippi itself exemplified irretrievable depravity. Today the state has more \u2014 not more relative to population,\u00a0more\u00a0\u2014 African Americans in elective offices than any other state. Culturally and economically, Mississippi is a vibrant participant in the American mainstream. The state\u2019s self-rehabilitation was not impossible.\u00a0In 2053, the 50th anniversary of Joey Chandler\u2019s crime, he will be 67, if he lives that long. Today, the Supreme Court should hear Chandler\u2019s case in order to provide standards requiring sentencing courts to be serious when making an extraordinarily serious judgment about someone\u2019s \u201cirretrievable depravity.\u201d\u00a0George Will\u2019s email address is\u202fgeorgewill@washpost.com.\u00a0\u00a9 2018, Washington Post Writers Group\u00a0NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
