Totally unmentioned, of course, was the fact that Planned Parenthood is also far and away the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, performing 321,384 abortions last fiscal year alone, according to the group\u2019s own annual report. That\u2019s more than one-third of the annual abortions performed every year in the U.S.Here\u2019s a sample of the questions Wen received during the segment: \u201cYou\u2019re the first doctor to lead this organization in more than a century. What do you plan to bring to the organization from your background?\u201d \u201cWhy did your family use Planned Parenthood?\u201d \u201cIt has now become such a politicized and such a controversial job. Did you have any trepidation about taking it?\u201d \u201cWere you encouraged after the elections?\u201dUnsurprisingly, Wen had little trouble dispensing with these queries, and they offered her a nice platform on which to present fluffy PR sound bites.\u00a0Though she was asked explicitly about abortion-related state-level amendments and about the possibility of a Supreme Court case overturning Roe v. Wade, Wen did not say the word \u201cabortion\u201d a single time during the entire interview. Instead, she relied on the favored euphemisms of the pro-choice movement: reproductive rights, access to health care, and that standard Planned Parenthood slogan, \u201cWomen\u2019s health care\u00a0is\u00a0health care.\u201dCBS made sure to display a picture of Wen with her own young child, as the new Planned Parenthood president said, \u201cBeing a parent has clarified my values, and what I want to do is shape the future for my son, Eli. It\u2019s a future where all people are treated the same, that all people have a right to health care, and it\u2019s a society where we trust women.\u201d The natural follow-up question \u201cTrust women to do what?\u201d was left unasked.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.The most interesting exchange occurred when one of the talking heads asked Wen for her thoughts on last week\u2019s elections.\u201cLess than 24 hours after the elections, we saw the Trump administration come out with new rules that would prevent employers, or, actually that would\u00a0allow\u00a0employers to deny women birth control coverage,\u201d she replied.\u00a0She was referring, of course, to the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Obamacare mandate, which required all employers, regardless of religious beliefs, to subsidize employees\u2019 contraception and abortifacients.Not one\u00a0minute later, however, Wen answered another question with the following bromide: \u201cI respect each person\u2019s beliefs for themselves. My problem is if they want to impose their own beliefs on other people.\u201d Apparently Wen\u2019s distaste for imposing beliefs on others does not extend to the federal government\u2019s efforts to compel Catholic nuns to subsidize abortion-inducing drugs.This interview was everything Planned Parenthood\u2019s public-relations team could hope for. In fact, it\u2019s tough to imagine how a Planned Parenthood marketing video would\u2019ve differed at all from this segment. Not only was Wen permitted to portray herself as a compassionate mother and physician, who only involves herself in politics when it\u2019s necessary to protect \u201cwomen\u2019s rights,\u201d but she also got away with avoiding abortion entirely.It\u2019s the perfect encapsulation of why Planned Parenthood\u2019s marketing has been so successful and why so many Americans are blissfully unaware that the group performs hundreds of thousands of abortions every year, all while passing itself off as indispensable health care. In reality, Planned Parenthood does very little outside the realm of sexual health. Aside from abortion, its most common offerings are STD tests and birth control.Consider how those 321,384 abortion procedures dwarfed adoption referrals (3,889) and prenatal services (7,762) last year. That means Planned Parenthood performed 83 abortions for every\u00a0one\u00a0adoption referral, and its prenatal services have dropped every year since 2009, from over 40,000 that year to just under 8,000.Last year, its facilities provided only 235,000 well-woman exams and 32,000 \u201cfamily practice services,\u201d and the group shuttered dozens of its clinics. Its locations are outnumbered 20 to one nationwide by federally qualified health-care centers that provide a host of health-care services without providing abortion.Despite Wen\u2019s multiple claims that Planned Parenthood is about health care, not politics, the group\u2019s political-action arm donates millions of dollars to left-wing, pro-choice politicians. During this year\u2019s midterms alone, the group spent more than $30 million to mobilize voters for Democratic candidates.Wen\u2019s interview this morning shows that Planned Parenthood intends to carry on deceiving the public, this time aided by a president who is both an immigrant and a doctor, better enabling her to pretend that her group focuses on everything under the sun but abortion. As long as media outlets such as CBS remain willing and eager to run cover, Planned Parenthood will continue to get away with it.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
