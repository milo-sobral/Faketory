The macro effect is staggering. Among ten top Senate committees, the average lifetime American Conservative Union rating for today\u2019s GOP chairmen is 85.3. Assuming that current ranking Democrats became chairmen, their average ACU rating would tumble to 7.1. In the House, across 10 top committees, the equivalent ACU averages would plunge from 88.6 to 5.0. Translation: Loud Democrat demands for higher taxes, bloated spending, spools of bright-red tape, and ferocious digging beneath every rock in the Trump administration.Come January, seniority and political jockeying might shuffle the leadership deck. But for now, imagine that today\u2019s ranking members led these committees. (For more details, see my spreadsheet here.)\u2022\u00a0The Senate Judiciary Committee chairmanship would shift from Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), with an 83.8 ACU rating, to Feinstein, a California Democrat. ACU: 8.8. This would promote Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s chief character assassin. Feinstein tried and failed to whack Kavanaugh with last-minute, unsubstantiated sexual-abuse charges.Despite his confirmation, Feinstein is not finished. She said Wednesday: \u201cI\u2019d be in favor of opening up the allegations, absolutely.\u201d Feinstein would activate the anti-Kavanaugh machine anew.Meanwhile, with two Supreme Court justices, 29 circuit court judges, and 53 district court jurists added to the federal bench, judicial confirmations are one of President Trump\u2019s and the GOP Senate\u2019s most encouraging achievements. This progress would grind to dust under Feinstein\u2019s gavel.\n\u2022\u00a0The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee mantle would shift from Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander (ACU: 72.1) to Washington Democrat Patty Murray (ACU: 2.4). After 9/11, she said about al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden: \u201cHe\u2019s been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building day-care facilities, building health-care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. He\u2019s made their lives better. We have not done that.\u201d\u2022\u00a0The Senate Budget Committee\u2019s leadership would move from Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming (90.9) to Vermont Socialist Bernie Sanders (6.7).\u201cSenator Sanders has sponsored legislation that would, on average, increase federal spending by $1.01 trillion per year and reduce it by about $6.7 billion per year,\u201d wrote the National Taxpayers Union Foundation\u2019s Demian Brady. From 2009 through 2015, NTU calculates, Sanders\u2019 net proposed outlays are \u201cmore than 17 times higher than what the average Democratic Senator proposed in the same time.\u201dAs for the House:\u2022\u00a0The Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairmanship would devolve from Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte (93.8) to New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler (2.7). House Democrats are obsessed with impeaching President Trump. Why? He defeated Hillary Clinton. How dare he?Judiciary would be Mission Control for impeachment. How fair and impartial would Nadler be? Hint: He boycotted Trump\u2019s oath of office.\u201cI cannot in good conscience participate in this honored and revered democratic tradition of the peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cI refuse to treat Jan. 20, 2017, as business as usual. For these reasons, I have no interest in participating in the inauguration ceremony of Donald J. Trump.\u201d\u2022\u00a0GOP Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes of California (85.1) would yield to California Democrat Adam Schiff (4.8). Schiff told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of the bad hombres,\u201d whom President Trump has denounced. Schiff likely would torpedo today\u2019s probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s and the Democrats\u2019 apparent collusion with Russians to excavate dirt on candidate Trump. Likewise, Schiff probably would ignore Hillary\u2019s approval of the Uranium One deal, which let Moscow purchase 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies, evidently in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation.\u2022\u00a0The Financial Services Committee\u2019s chairmanship would be a jump to the left. Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling (97.1) would cede to California Democrat Maxine Waters (4.3). She notoriously told radical leftists how to confront top Trump supporters: \u201cYou create a crowd. And you push back on them.\u201dIn May 2008, she told oil executives, \u201cThis liberal would be about socializing . . . would be about, basically, taking over, and the government running all of your companies.\u201d She also once observed: \u201cI have to march because my mother could not have an abortion.\u201dThis scenario is spookier than Halloween. Election Day arrives one week after that. Voters should run scared to the polls and stop this horror show from happening.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
