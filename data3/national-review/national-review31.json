First, by accepting tickets to the broadway show Hamilton from an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a lobbyist, and then pretending that he believed they had been purchased by his brother. Second, by staying at a villa in Costa Rica that was paid for by \u201cAdam Corey, a lobbyist and longtime ally of Gillum,\u201d and then insisting he paid for it himself:During the gubernatorial debate, DeSantis also pressed Gillum on whether he paid for the \u201cvilla in Costa Rica,\u201d a reference to his accommodations on that trip, which did not include Miller. Gillum has said he and his wife paid cash for the May 2016 Costa Rica accommodations, a contention refuted in the newly released emails.In one of the emails, from June 2016, Corey promised his accountant a breakdown of an $8,868 credit card charge. Corey\u2019s assistant later responded with a list of people to invoice.That list shows that Gillum and his wife, R. Jai Gillum, were responsible for $941.95, but that line was crossed out. A note next to it said, \u201cHOLD ON BILLING.\u201d Gillum\u2019s email address was not included in a subsequent list of people who were invoiced for taking part in the Costa Rica trip.In September, Kise said his client never received money from Gillum.It seems pretty clear that Gillum has been untruthful in his description of these transactions. Or, rather, it seems clear to everyone other than Andrew Gillum, who has taken to suggesting that the questions he is being asked are\u00a0motivated by racism. During the first debate with DeSantis, Gillum said the following when asked about the Hamilton tickets:\u201cI didn\u2019t take free trips from anybody. I\u2019m a hardworking person. I know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do. But I\u2019ve worked hard for everything that I\u2019ve gotten in my life, and I don\u2019t need anybody handing me anything for free.\u201dThis morning, Politico confirms, Gillum is sticking with this angle:\u201cAll along \u2026 they\u2019ve wanted the people of this state to believe somehow I haven\u2019t deserved what I\u2019ve gotten, I\u2019m unethical, participated in illegal and illicit activity. I mean, you name it. The goal is obviously to use my candidacy as a way to reinforce, frankly, stereotypes about black men.\u201dOne has to wonder who \u201cthey\u201d is. As far as I can see, every single newspaper here in Florida has covered this story, including all the ones that have endorsed Gillum. This is not a wild conspiracy theory, nor a half-truth spun out of proportion by a random blogger. It is a real story that has appeared in real outlets. That Gillum\u2019s instinct is to cry \u201cracism\u201d when questioned about a legitimate story is extraordinary \u2014 and it does not bode well for Florida should he prevail in the coming election.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
