She\u2019s also the mother of 13 children, ten of whom are adopted. As she tells the story, she intended on adopting only one child \u2014 \u201cmaybe two.\u201d But then she started hearing horror stories about what happens to children when they are stuck in foster care. Knowing that there is a shortage of newborns for the couples who want to adopt, she wanted to adopt a child \u201cwho otherwise would not have a forever family.\u201d\u201cMy kids should be getting this award because they went through hell and they survived,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey survived the foster-care system. My kids from Africa survived situations you guys wouldn\u2019t even believe if I told you. They survived. Not only that, they are awesome people, wonderful human beings \u2014 much better than I am. If I had gone through what they went through, I would not be kind, I would not be loving.\u201dHer adoption story begins when she and her husband got licensed and were matched up with a little boy and arranged to take him and his siblings camping. In the middle of the night, his younger brother \u201creached his little hand\u201d from across his sleeping bag and asked Delilah, \u201cI was just wondering, could I call you mom, too, since I don\u2019t have a mom?\u201dBoth those boys, nine and eleven, had been in foster care for more than five years \u2014 the eleven-year-old with eleven placements, the nine-year-old, seven. \u201cI went from being a mom of two to being a mom of five in a six-month span.\u201d\n\u201cFor some reason, our governmental systems think that it is better to leave children languishing in foster care so that the birth parent can have opportunity after opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to abuse them and break their hearts while they are moved again and again and again.\u201d That first eleven-year-old boy she adopted had had eleven placements during his foster-care time. A ten-year-old child had had nine placements, the last in a mental-health facility, \u201cbecause she had been sodomized by her foster brother, the foster mother\u2019s oldest son.\u201d Charges were never filed. \u201cWhy? Oh, because a year before she had been sexually abused in a foster-care setting and they didn\u2019t want to put her through the trauma of another court case.\u201d\u201cHow is that okay?\u201d was Delilah\u2019s rallying cry to post-election leaders in Washington and across the country.This is tough stuff to hear. And it doesn\u2019t take away from the selflessness of adoptive parents who realize they are not in the best position to care for their children; it doesn\u2019t lessen the generosity of foster families who make room in their homes knowing their own hearts will be broken when the children into whom they pour their love are moved to a forever family \u2013 whether their birth family or another. Saying it on Capitol Hill is important. Present were some key administration officials, congressional staff, and activists. One of the \u201cFriend of Adoption\u201d awardees was the Democratic mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser, who had just won reelection; she\u2019s the single adoptive mother of Miranda.Delilah was especially passionate talking about the almost 20,000 children who aged out of foster care in the United States last year. She pointed out that most of them are likely to wind up in jail before they are 25 years old.\u201cHow many of you have 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds right now?\u201d she asked those gathered. \u201cAre they capable of navigating life on their own? Without health-care insurance? Without a place to live? Without a life plan? Without a mom to call when they just got in a fender bender? How is that okay?\u201d\u201cWe have to change things\u201d in \u201cthe most prosperous place in the world.\u201d She pointed to the dramatic drop in international adoptions in recent years. Her message is that we can do better.The National Council for Adoption exists \u201cto ensure that more children are adopted from foster care, that women facing unintended pregnancy receive comprehensive information on the positive option of adoption, and that intercountry adoption remains a viable, ethical option for building families.\u201d Its Hall of Fame includes Democrats and Republicans, sports stars and Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy\u2019s.\u201cWe have to speak up. . . . We don\u2019t have enough foster homes.\u201d Delilah described the hotel where children as young as ten years old in foster care \u201care stuck\u201d \u2014 her SWAT-police-officer son patrols there nightly in Washington State. \u201cThe parking lot is shared with a business called Lover\u2019s Package,\u201d which sells \u201csex toys.\u201d \u201cWould you want your ten-year-old or grandchild spending a night alone in a hotel that shares a parking lot with Lover\u2019s Package?\u201dEarlier in the week, in an opinion piece, one adoptive mother expressed her regret that she had adopted two girls from China, because she\u2019s dismayed with life under President Trump. We need more, not fewer foster families stepping up to the plate, and more pregnant women and families considering adoption. So many of us have more power than we realize. The clock is ticking for children in foster care, for frightened pregnant women who feel as if there\u2019s no one who will help them. Our feelings about the state of the world aside, they need families, they need the kind of radical hospitality that can transform lives.Delilah\u2019s Liberian daughter Blessing, once \u201cbeaten beyond recognition\u201d as a three-year-old, is now her class president. There are children alive today who need help, birth mothers who need an out. They deserve an opportunity for a family and some semblance of stability. Our country may just need their lives and resilience. We can\u2019t let them continue to suffer. We can\u2019t let them be unrealized gifts.This column is based on one available through Andrews McMeel Universal\u2019s Newspaper Enterprise Association.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
