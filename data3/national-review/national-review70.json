She can try to defend herself and say that she wasn\u2019t trying to compare what the Nazis did to what Trump is doing, but simply reading the assignment is enough to show that that was clearly her intent. She wasn\u2019t simply asking students to examine Trump\u2019s policies, she was asking them to examine Trump\u2019s policies through the lens of what happened in Nazi Germany, which clearly insinuates that she is looking for students to draw some similarities between the two.Personally, I am someone who has vehemently disagreed with both Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his policies when it comes to immigration. As a libertarian, I\u2019d advocate for more immigration, not less. Recently, I\u2019ve criticized the way he\u2019s discussed the migrant caravan, and accused him of using it as a way to stoke fear ahead of the midterm elections.Despite all of this, I\u2019d have to agree with Tikva\u2019s view of this assignment. Clearly, the intent behind it was for students to draw parallels between Nazi Germany and the modern-day United States, and to even insinuate such a comparison is vehemently offensive to everyone who suffered at the hands of the Nazis. It\u2019s one thing to criticize Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric, as I have certainly done, it\u2019s entirely another to compare them with the mass murder of millions upon millions of Jews \u2014 and I can\u2019t wrap my head around why that\u2019s apparently so difficult for some people to understand.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
