(I had it as \u201cWexler,\u201d somehow, and it\u2019s now fixed.) Thanks for the correction, and apologies for the error. The folks behind the \u201cTrumpstock\u201d ad believe strongly in getting people\u2019s last names right.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
