Let\u2019s call it an unappealing appeal.But unappeal I must, at least when addressing a certain (very large) class of NRO readers and feasters \u2014 there are hundreds of thousands of you! \u2014 who know that their chubby hands are in the cookie jars, crumbs on their chins and shirt, and that I have the photo evidence.But let\u2019s not play gotcha. Not too much anyway. Let\u2019s do this instead (and be prepared for a lot of metaphor-mixing):.\u00a0.\u00a0. let\u2019s encourage the NRO frequent flyer to put down the drumstick and look into his conscience and to ask it: \u201cConscience, given all the consumption I\u2019ve enjoyed here at NRO, is not the right thing for me to do to make a gesture \u2014 not a hand wave or a thumbs-up or an attaboy \u2014 but a financial contribution, to acknowledge both the excellence of everything over which I\u2019ve lip-smacked these past months and years as an NRO squatter? By the way, Conscience, I\u2019m asking because this jackass NRO Suit is harassing me about discussing this with you.\u201dAnd Conscience will reply: \u201cYou have stuffing at the corner of you mouth. Right there. Nope, the other corner. You got it. Now, are you asking me should you make a donation to NR? Of course you should, and you should have done it months ago!\u201dIf you come to NRO (I have permission to use that abbreviation; all others here now must resort to nationalreview.com) every day, several times a day . . . if you relentlessly feast here on all the amazing conservative content .\u00a0.\u00a0. if this is the source for a doctor-recommended daily dose of sanity and wisdom .\u00a0.\u00a0. if you can\u2019t start a morning without a Geraghty Jolt .\u00a0.\u00a0. then you have to donate.Hey, I\u2019m not telling you this \u2014 your Conscience is.Friends, you are not stupid. You are smart (and not in a Fredo way), because you are conservatives. We think .\u00a0.\u00a0. they feel. We give .\u00a0.\u00a0. they take. And because you are conservatives you know this cardinal rule of economics: There ain\u2019t no free lunch.Hey! Maybe we\u2019re the ones not so smart, because we provide that free lunch \u2014 and breakfast and dinner and late-night snack. Regardless: There comes a time when even the guy whose picture is next to \u201ctightwad\u201d in the dictionary knows he has to put something into the tip jar or the collection plate. Knows that yeah, it may only happen once a year, or a decade, but it\u2019s my grudging turn to buy back. Knows that yeah, a lot of other people have been buying me and my insatiable thirst endless rounds for endless days.About the worst thing someone can say to you is: You smell. And boy oh boy have I heard a lot of that in my life.But about the next worst thing you can say to someone is : You\u2019re cheap.Are you?You see, if you smell, it may or may not be a conscious act. And if you desire, just write me separately and I can share my thoughts and experiences offline. But if you are cheap, well, yeah, it\u2019s not an omission. It\u2019s very much an act \u2014 I almost said sin \u2014 of commission.Now, you don\u2019t want to be cheap.So to you soon-to-be ex-NRO-freeloaders: The time has come for you to show support. NRO means the world to you, is your safe space, is your playground and your theater, all that and so much more, all rolled into one. All this great writing, all this ramparts-mounting and bayonet-fixing and lefty-b****-slapping, all that and more \u2014 it happens because our friends from time to time show us some support.This time is your time to time.\u00a0(function() { var d = document, fr = d.createElement('script'); fr.type = 'text/javascript'; fr.async = true; fr.src = 'https://static.fundrazr.com/widgets/loader.js'; var s = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(fr, s);})();Our webathon goal is $300,000. As I type we are about $20,000 short of that. We shut down the appeals and berating at 11:59 p.m. on Election Night. See fit to making that important donation before then. How about .\u00a0.\u00a0. right now? As for how much, nothing is too small or too big \u2014 $10, $100, $1,000, the amounts may differ, but each and every contribution is truly appreciated and beloved.Okay, please make that donation here.Now go back to the buffet and get yourself some of that tapioca. It\u2019s really creamy. And did you try the eggplant parmigiana? It\u2019s like my grandmother is in the kitchen!NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
