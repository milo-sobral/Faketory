At the Armory in New York, it\u2019s in its third year. After two long visits last weekend, I thought the fair wasn\u2019t a case of the good, the bad, and the ugly, but, rather, the sublime, the clunkers, and the bewildering.TEFAF as a brand offers authenticity, transparency, and a match of the best art, distinguished dealers, and the richest, savviest buyers. Objects are rigorously vetted by curators, so there are no fakes. Duds? Well, that\u2019s another story. First, the high points.Wildenstein & Co. is among the most revered art dealers in the world, and it did not disappoint. Its impeccably designed booth showed many star works but none so dazzling as Charles Le Brun\u2019s Dream of St. Joseph, from the early 1650s. This picture has everything we want in a high-end art fair. In his time, Le Brun was France\u2019s best painter of religious, historical, and mythological subjects, so we have a great name. There\u2019s the gold standard of provenance in Anne of Austria, the widow of Louis XIII and mother of the Sun King, Louis XIV. She commissioned the picture for the Carmelite convent oratory where she prayed. We have rarity. Of the six paintings she commissioned for the space, this is the only one that survived the spoliation of church art during the French Revolution. It\u2019s gorgeous, with lovely, subtle colors and a lilting composition. If you\u2019re an ardent Catholic, it\u2019s dogmatically precise. I liked its combination of wall power and soothing presence. Some Baroque angels have all the delicacy of a space shuttle on reentry, but this one glides with nary a rattle. It\u2019s a dream scene, after all. And the picture is new to the market. At $5 million, to say something utterly irreligious, it\u2019s a steal.Thomas Colville, another old-fashioned dealer and connoisseur, offered Theodore Rousseau\u2019s Soleil Couchant sur les sables de Sainte-Jean-de-Paris, from the mid 1860s. It\u2019s a fresh-to-the-market painting in pristine condition by an artist just at the edge of the Impressionism revolution. He painted scenes that were mundane \u2014 no spectacular, awe-inspiring views \u2014 and moody at the same time. Colville\u2019s is what I call a hot landscape, with lots of pink and yellow enlivening rock, scrub, moss, and gnarly trees. Rousseau painted an earlier, bigger version on a used canvas. He\u2019d done a landscape on it already and simply painted over it. The underpaint started to bleed through the new paint, so he did a fresh version, which is for sale for $325,000.I like dealer booths that focus on a single artist because they become a small retrospective. Bernard Goldberg, a distinguished American art dealer, focused on the enigmatic, easily spotted, never boring Charles Burchfield. His display aptly shows how important dealers are in advancing connoisseurship. With about 15 good Burchfields, I could see his evolution as an artist. Dealers, in fact, often do a better job at connoisseurship than curators and certainly better than academics. Moonlight in a Flower Garden from 1961 is a late, big watercolor and a quivering, evocative fantasy. It\u2019s $1,350,000, which first struck me as expensive, but it\u2019s a fine picture that has made it into all the best Burchfield shows.\nRonald Phillips was also focused. His booth celebrated the designer Thomas Chippendale, whose 300th birthday is this year. An impressive mahogany armchair from 1765, at $335,000, deserved its place of pride. It\u2019s a masterpiece of English rococo, with a touch of whimsy. It\u2019s regal enough to command that you sit like an aristocrat. It was part of a set commissioned by William Plumber for his Gilston Park home and now split among the Met, the Victoria & Albert, and private collections. Its brother and sister chairs have done well in finding their way to distinguished homes, which makes this chair more appealing in the marketplace.S. J. Shrubsole, another distinguished dealer, carries the banner for the best antique English silver. Many silver dealers, among them S. J. Phillips, Shrubsole\u2019s London counterpart, have largely abandoned old silver for the more lucrative jewelry market, and this is sad. Great English silver from the 18th and 19th centuries is, to me, sculpture, with moments of technical brilliance and dynamic allure. Today, it\u2019s very much a niche market, though I think every cultivated home should have something like a pair of magnificent, massive silver Ambassadorial baskets by Thomas Heming, the royal goldsmith during the early years of George III\u2019s reign. Made in 1763, they belonged to the second earl of Buckinghamshire while he was British envoy to Russia, hence the royal coat of arms. The royal goldsmith\u2019s wares are rarely cutting-edge but, rather, elegant and conservative. The two baskets are elaborately pierced in rococo style but a bit subdued, having no asymmetrical dips and swirls. This would have made it seem too French, which, to English eyes, meant effete and silly. They\u2019re $250,000 for the pair. Two gilt replicas are in the Royal Collection.There were many other high points, but I had to look for them. Now, the duds. The two opening booths when visitors entered the hall belonged to Richard Green and Agnew, two great London dealers. Richard Green played it safe, with big Impressionist names such as Renoir and Pissarro at their second-rate best. It\u2019s hard for the great Impressionist Alfred Sisley to bore, but Le Loing au dessous du Pont de Moret, from 1892, is the blandest Sisley I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s too expensive at $5.25 million because it\u2019s so unremarkable, aside from its brand, big size, and, I admit, beautiful condition.Agnew\u2019s tiny Pissarro of a Paris street scene from 1897 isn\u2019t exactly early dementia, but it\u2019s a cautious thing and didn\u2019t deserve its front-of-the-shop placement next to an equally dull picture by C\u00e9zanne. It\u2019s been in the same private collection since 1950, and it\u2019s pristine, but it\u2019s not important at all, in Pissarro\u2019s career or in the genre of French cityscapes. It\u2019s $3.4 million.I look to both dealers to give great quality with great names, as Wildenstein, Colville, and others did. I think the dealers would say, \u201cIt\u2019s the customer\u2019s fault,\u201d and they wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong. Every great dealer has stories about rich collectors who enter the gallery, adviser at tow, saying, \u201cI have 15 minutes . . . the car\u2019s outside with the motor running,\u201d meaning, \u201cshow me your biggest names because I don\u2019t have time to think too deeply.\u201d I\u2019m sure this happens more often than ever now, but the great dealers are much more than car salesmen. They\u2019re as passionate about art as the best collectors, know their art, and most have a near-religious calling.Too many dealers instead used big names as a prop, and I think today\u2019s collectors are, as a whole, more adventurous. They\u2019ve certainly never been richer, which makes the discriminating ones more inclined to take leaps of faith on artists such as Magnasco, Mengs, Simeon Solomon, or L. S. Lowry, not marquee names but represented with stellar work by dealers who are solid but not known powerhouses. I saw an itsy-bitsy painting of a Spanish cleric by the 14-year-old Pablo Picasso. The object was presented like a movie star at Jaime Eguiguren\u2019s booth. It\u2019s juvenilia. I didn\u2019t ask the price. I didn\u2019t want to know. I\u2019d seen enough overpriced, mediocre grown-up Picasso at that point. And too many dealers were selling antique jewelry, which, to me, belonged not at TEFAF but in a jewelry store.And then the Italians. There were lots of Italian dealers who, I think, were exploring the American market. I thought the Madonna and Child, presented by\u00a0Frascione Arte and attributed to the Master of the Scandicci Lamentation, from around 1510, was beautiful. We don\u2019t know the artist\u2019s name, but it\u2019s Florentine classicism with shades of Raphael, Ghirlandaio, and Filippino Lippi, plus a distinctive, eccentric edge. It belonged to Pope Urban VIII and a succession of Barberini cardinals before landing around 1900 in a British collection. It\u2019s a mystery, in perfect condition, and, at $900,000, fairly priced. It\u2019s a quirky thing and risky, too. Art historians are still developing a settled take on the artist.Decidedly carnal is a pair of Italian ladies I kept visiting, trying to puzzle them out, and deciding finally that the aesthetic was, well, different. Not bad. Just different. The Italian dealer Alberto di Castro\u2019s Female Nudes, from around 1880, by an unknown Roman painter did grow on me. At first, I thought it was tacky gaudy gangster chic \u2014 the fair had a good helping of it \u2014 but it\u2019s beautifully painted and made me think of Anna Magnani, known as \u201cLa Lupa,\u201d the she-wolf, but in this picture definitely on steroids. I can\u2019t pin a style on it: Decadent Romanticism meets proto-neo-realism, maybe. One figure is big, bold, and brassy, the other nude frozen still, a bit bony, and shielding her eyes, a contrast that suggests a narrative, indeed demands one. It makes a statement, was the anti-safe-and-boring Impressionist brand, and, at $80,000, was the least expensive thing I saw. \u201cThey both need a lotta love,\u201d was all I could think. I hope they find a good home.\u00a0NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
