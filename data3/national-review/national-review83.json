The \u201cprogressives\u201d savored their big victory over a piece of metal, but quite a few people in the state have sided with the rule of law.In today\u2019s Martin Center article, Jay Schalin looks at the state of the battle over Silent Sam.For one thing, the people guilty of property destruction have so far gotten off very easy. Schalin writes, \u201cA total of 24 people have been arrested in conjunction with the August 20 riot and subsequent protests. So far, they have escaped punishment\u2014and they are not likely to receive much if the recent past is any indication. Maya Little, a doctoral student in history at UNC-Chapel Hill, who was arrested earlier this year for pouring a mixture of ink and blood on the statue (and on a police officer\u2019s body camera), was found guilty of a misdemeanor charge for defacing the statue\u2014but was not given any punishment by the Orange County court. Another controversy erupted during her student court hearing when she received nothing more than a letter of warning and 18 hours of community service as punishment. Little and other protesters marched out of court, claiming that one of the jurors was biased against her.\u201dWhile that\u2019s not Chancellor Carol Folt\u2019s problem, she does have to respond to the UNC Board of Governors, which has given her until early December to set forth a plan for restoring the statue. As Schalin explains, Folt is in a tough position: \u201cIf Silent Sam is sent packing or banished to some dusty, out-of-the-way alcove, it will appear to many that she is handing the keys to the campus to those who reject the rule of law. On the other hand, if she returns Sam to his former home on McCorkle Place or some other equally prominent spot, the mob will likely try to pull him down again. So what are she and the Trustees supposed to do?\u201dThis certainly isn\u2019t the sort of dilemma Carol Folt expected to face at UNC when she left Dartmouth to become chancellor here in 2013.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
