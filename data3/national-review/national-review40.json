For example: Owing to its horrific history, blackface is absolutely never okay, and it is absolutely crucial that students avoid it. It\u2019s also important to be respectful of other cultures when choosing a costume, so I certainly don\u2019t have any issue with those suggestions whatsoever.Where I do have an issue, however, is with that first question: \u201cIs my costume making fun of a group of people?\u201d Honestly, I would answer that question in one way only: \u201cSo what if it is?\u201d I mean honestly, who cares if someone uses a little bit of humor to poke fun at a group of people, as long as it\u2019s not doing something offensive like making fun of a race or culture? A few years ago, I went out for Halloween dressed as a Hot Topic manager, and I absolutely was doing so in order to make fun of Hot Topic managers. It was probably one of my favorite Halloween costumes ever, and I have absolutely no regrets about doing it regardless of what this guide states. It was funny, and I don\u2019t want to see our culture reach a point where the complete obsession with sensitivity makes it impossible to do things that are funny.We all need a little laughter in our lives, and Halloween is a great time of year for people to be creative and use their senses of humor to create funny, clever costumes. It\u2019s entirely possible that some of these funny, clever ideas may fall into the category of making fun of a group of people, but that shouldn\u2019t really matter. We should all be emotionally strong enough to be able to take a joke, especially when it\u2019s all in good fun.Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t seem as though any students would actually be punished for violating these guidelines. According to Campus Reform, the USG released the same guide last year and told the publication at the time that \u201cthe guidelines themselves would not be a basis for disciplinary action.\u201dNR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
