Over at the Courier-Journal, D. Stephen Voss, a political scientist at the University of Kentucky, offers a note of skepticism about automatic voter registration and early voting, two popular reform measures, especially among liberals. Drawing on his reading of the scholarly literature, he observes that early voting might actually reduce participation as \u201cvoting is a fundamentally social act,\u201d and the widespread availability of early voting might weaken peer effects that tend to boost turnout. And as for automatic voter registration, he observes that the marginal eligible voters who find themselves on the registration rolls by default tend to vote at low levels.He points to Oregon, a pioneer of automatic voter registration, where two-thirds of registrants \u201cwho had not already interacted with an election official, either to register or to declare a party affiliation\u201d chose not to vote at all in 2016, thus lowering the overall turnout rate among registered voters. Suffice it to say, this isn\u2019t a slam-dunk case against automatic voter registration, as Voss acknowledges. I\u2019d still be inclined to support it. But he does remind us that well-intentioned reforms don\u2019t always have the salutary consequences their advocates hope for.If I had my druthers, we would ensure that all voting-age citizens, especially the poorest, have a high-quality photo ID that could serve as proof of identity for purposes of voting. This would go hand in hand with automatic voter registration. To boost turnout, we\u2019d make Election Day a federal holiday, or we\u2019d move it to a weekend, and perhaps we\u2019d encourage state and local jurisdictions to align their elections with federal elections, as the (decidedly left-of-center) Zoltan Hajnal recently recommended in the New York Times. Alas, the prospects for such a set of reforms are not bright, at least not now. And so election rules will continue to be a political football.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
