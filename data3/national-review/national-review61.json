They have a tough time filling those jobs, because working in the oil business, even in a semi-skilled capacity, pays a heck of a lot more than that: One company right now is offering new drivers with Class-A commercial drivers\u2019 licenses $20,000 bonuses. Other companies will take anybody with a clean driving record and train him to get a CDL.I\u2019ll have a great deal more to say about this in an upcoming piece for the magazine, but the one undeniable lesson of the labor market here is: Demand matters. A growing economy needs labor, and when firms really have to compete for every worker, as they do here, wages go up.Tomasky, with an eye toward Tuesday\u2019s elections, writes that Democrats ought to use the improved political position they are expected to have post-election to \u201cbury supply-side economics.\u201d He describes that school of thought as the belief that \u201ccutting taxes, especially on the rich, and decreasing regulation will unleash so much innovation and economic activity that tax revenues will actually increase and the entire economy will benefit.\u201d If that were all there were to the Right\u2019s economic thinking, then, indeed, that would be an idea worth burying, and the myth of self-financing tax cuts has done a great deal of damage to Republicans\u2019 credibility on fiscal questions. But that is not all there is to free-market economic thinking, or to the economic thinking of elected Republicans such as Paul Ryan, Ben Sasse, or Justin Amash.\nIn any case, it is a tough time to be putting forward an indictment of Republican economic policies \u2014 even in the New York Times, which on another page reports the achievement of \u201cnew heights for the job market.\u201d Say what? \u201cEmployers keep creating jobs at a healthy clip, 250,000 of them in October, a boom that was apparent in every major sector and that continued unabated even as the American economy inched closer to full employment.\u201d Those 250,000 new jobs outperformed economists\u2019 forecasts. We tend to overestimate the influence of politics on near-term economic developments, but we can at least say that Republican governance \u2014 the president, the Senate, the House, the majority of state governments \u2014 has coincided with a period of welcome growth and prosperity. As a purely political question, running against the Republicans on the economy is, just at the moment, probably a losing proposition.There are a few things that need to be untangled here.Taxes and regulation are not a unitary issue, and \u201cregulation\u201d is a term so vague and nebulous as to be effectively useless. There are good regulations and bad ones, effective regulations and ineffective ones, and \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 regulations that fall on the right side of the cost-benefit analysis and those that fall on the wrong side. Nobody wants to poison the drinking water, and, with the exception of a few loopy environmentalists, nobody wants to see drivers paying $30 a gallon for gasoline. The proper business of regulation is mitigating the effects of certain kinds of externalities (including risk) in a minimally disruptive way.You know what was heavily regulated in the run-up to the subprime-mortgage meltdown a few years ago? Mortgage lending. Banking in general is a pretty heavily regulated business, but the regulations we had in place (and have in place) are not especially effective at doing what we want them to do. Discussions of \u201cregulation\u201d and \u201cderegulation\u201d as abstractions are not particularly useful. Presumably, intelligent Democrats acting in good faith would oppose ineffective regulations, too, it\u2019s just that the Democratic party is not dominated by intelligent people acting in good faith \u2014 some are one, some are the other, but very few are both.The tax debate suffers from a similar problem of oversimplification. We tinker with taxes all the time, and some of that tinkering matters a great deal: The recent structural changes to the corporate tax code are beneficial and important, probably more so than is generally appreciated. But while we love to monkey with rates, the general tax scene doesn\u2019t change all that much: In 1957, when notional tax rates were dramatically higher than what they are today, the federal government collected 17.2 percent of GDP in taxes. In 2015, the federal government collected 17.7 percent of GDP in taxes \u2014 a little higher, but not all that much.What is radically different is how much money was spent and \u2014 even more important \u2014 what that money was spent on: In 1957, we spent 9.8 percent of GDP on the military, nearly three times what we\u2019ve typically spent in recent years \u2014 and we had a balanced budget. The overwhelming majority of our spending now is transfers and other social spending \u2014 defense accounts for less than 20 percent of outlays \u2014 and we run a substantial deficit.There are Republicans who would like to see higher defense spending and more tax cuts, which would be irresponsible: There is no time like the present \u2014 especially the prosperous present \u2014 to get the deficit under control. But, contra Tomasky, it isn\u2019t Republican priorities that are swelling the deficit: Those tax cuts certainly will contribute to future deficits, but they will account for about $2.7 trillion in new debt over a decade during which the national debt is forecast to increase by $16 trillion. You don\u2019t get $16 trillion in new debt from a $2.7 trillion tax cut, even if you think tax cuts in the current fiscal environment are a bad policy. Deficit-enabled entitlement spending (like all deficit-enabled spending, and deficit-enabled tax cuts) may support demand in the present, but it does so by borrowing from the future: Just because we are not paying the bills today doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t going to have to be paid one of these days. The idea that the federal government is going to manage that with such finesse as to somehow make that tradeoff a winning proposition, or even a painless one, strikes me as implausible.If you want to keep that social spending where it is, then, in the long term, you will need to approximately double federal tax collections. If you want to keep taxes where they are or cut them, you will need to cut entitlement spending.Moaning about \u201cinequality\u201d in the abstract may be pretty good politics, but the concrete alternative to entitlement reform \u2014 doubling federal taxes \u2014 is conspicuously absent from the Democrats\u2019 economic rhetoric. Democrats and Republicans both eventually must face the fact \u2014 or they will be compelled to face the fact \u2014 that the math is the math, that their choice is between unpopular entitlement reform and unpopular tax increases, and that, as Herb Stein famously put it, \u201cIf something can\u2019t go on forever, it will stop.\u201d Unfortunately for Tomasky et al., you can\u2019t moralize your way out of that predicament. Unfortunately for the Republicans, we are not likely to grow our way out of hard choices, either.And, of course, we citizens ought to grow up a little bit and take a less credulous and superstitious view of the relationship between the president and the economy. It\u2019s not that policy choices don\u2019t matter \u2014 lifting our absurd ban on crude oil exports has meant a lot here in Midland \u2014 but there are many forces that shape the economic scene at any given moment, many of them having not a thing to do with the views of the American president or the actions of the government over which he presides. It wasn\u2019t an act of Congress that put oil in the ground in the Permian Basin \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t politicians who figured out how to get it out. Years of investments, experimentation, and plain hard grunt work went into that, and very little of that work happened in Washington.I agree that the Democrats need a new story on the economy. Republicans, too. And maybe both of them should, if only for the novelty, try one that is true.NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 National Review\t\t\t\t\t"}
