{"id": "Early-stage SaaS VC slip snaps recovery as public software stocks soar", "paragraph": "A few months ago, Crunchbase  News\u00a0reported\u00a0that a longstanding period of SaaS investment stagnation had come to an end.However, the investment boom times didn\u2019t necessarily carry over to the seed and early-stage end of the subscription software businesses.The chart below displays deal and dollar volume of seed and early-stage venture investments1 made into companies from around the world in Crunchbase\u2019s\u00a0SaaS\u00a0category. Note that it is subject to historically documented reporting delays, which are most pronounced in seed and early-stage deals.As can be plainly seen that Q3 2018 took quite a turn in terms of investment into SaaS. And it\u2019s a bit bewildering as to why.Overall, the\u00a0venture market in Q3 hit record heights, and nearly every stage of investment saw more dollars and more rounds. Yet, as shown above, SaaS startups don\u2019t appear to be beneficiaries of this influx of cash.The picture becomes even more distorted when we account for public market SaaS comps, which set the benchmark for private companies. And that benchmark hasn\u2019t been suffering. Public cloud companies have enjoyed a steep run up in asset value over the past several years.The\u00a0newly revamped\u00a0BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index (formerly known as\u00a0the Bessemer Cloud Index) tracks a basket of publicly traded SaaS stocks, including the likes of\u00a0Salesforce,\u00a0Adobe and more recent debuts like\u00a0Dropbox,\u00a0DocuSign and\u00a0Okta, among others.Public companies in the Bessemer Cloud Index\u00a0grew their public valuations much faster than more broad-based indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. Carried by the\u00a0high\u00a0and\u00a0still-growing value of recurring revenue,\u00a0warm reception of SaaS companies\u00a0new to public markets and (with the exception of the past couple of weeks) generally stable markets overall, public SaaS companies have done well. Despite a pretty absurd rate of growth on the public side, no such consistent growth could be found on the early-stage, private end of the market.However, rather than viewing Q3 2018 as a disappointment for the early-stage SaaS investment market, it\u2019s more like a reversion to the mean. It\u2019s the first half of the year that\u2019s the outlier, not Q3.The first half of 2018 had some truly huge early-stage deals cross the wires. In March, Robotic process automation software company\u00a0UiPath\u00a0raised\u00a0$153 million in its Series B. (UiPath just raised\u00a0another $225 million in a Series C round\u00a0in September.) Collaborative email inbox\u00a0Front App raised $66 million\u00a0in its January Series B. Rival Chicago logistics software companies\u00a0FourKites\u00a0and\u00a0project44\u00a0each raised $35 million Series B rounds earlier in the year. On a one-off basis, these are big rounds, but collectively they add up to a huge pile of money.The conclusion we\u2019re drawn to here is that we were perhaps premature in declaring the long-time downtrend snapped to the upside."}
