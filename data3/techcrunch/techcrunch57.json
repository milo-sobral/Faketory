Once users open Waze, the app will\u00a0detect any of the supported music apps installed on their smartphones. Users can tap the music note icon to select their audio app within Waze. To switch from one audio app to another \u2014 say from NPR to iHeartRadio \u2014 users\u00a0tap the music note icon again and then hit \u201cchange app.\u201dUsers will be able to control whichever content they\u2019re listening to using\u00a0forward, backward and pause icons. They\u2019ll also be able to save content to a library."}
