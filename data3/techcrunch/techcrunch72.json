{"id": "In a court filing, Edward Snowden says a report critical to an NSA lawsuit is authentic", "paragraph": "An unexpected declaration by whistleblower Edward Snowden  filed in court this week adds a new twist in a long-running lawsuit against the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance programs.The case, filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation  a decade ago, seeks to challenge the government\u2019s alleged illegal and unconstitutional surveillance of Americans, who are largely covered under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections against warrantless searches and seizures.It\u2019s a big step forward for the case, which had stalled largely because the government refused to confirm that a leaked document was authentic or accurate.News of the surveillance broke in 2006 when an AT&T technician Mark Klein revealed that the NSA was tapping into AT&T\u2019s network backbone. He alleged that a secret, locked room \u2014 dubbed Room 641A \u2014 in an AT&T facility in San Francisco where he worked was one of many around the U.S. used by the government to monitor communications \u2014 domestic and overseas. President George W. Bush authorized the NSA to secretly wiretap Americans\u2019 communications shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.Much of the EFF\u2019s complaint relied on Klein\u2019s testimony until 2013, when Snowden, a former NSA contractor, came forward with new revelations that described and detailed the vast scope of the U.S. government\u2019s surveillance capabilities, which included participation from other phone giants \u2014 including Verizon (TechCrunch\u2019s parent company).Snowden\u2019s signed declaration, filed on October 31, confirms that one of the documents he leaked, which the EFF relied heavily on for its case, is an authentic draft document written by the then-NSA inspector general in 2009, which exposed concerns about the legality of the Bush\u2019s warrantless surveillance program \u2014 Stellar Wind \u2014 particularly the collection of bulk email records on Americans.The draft top-secret document was never published, and the NSA had refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the 2009 inspector general report, ST-09-0002 \u2014 despite that it\u2019s been public for many years.Snowden, as one of the few former NSA staffers who can speak more freely than former government employees about the agency\u2019s surveillance, confirmed that the document is \u201cauthentic.\u201d\u201cI read its contents carefully during my employment,\u201d he said in his declaration. \u201cI have a specific and strong recollection of this document because it indicated to me that the government had been conducting illegal surveillance.\u201dSnowden left his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong in 2013 when he gave tens of thousand of documents to reporters. His passport was cancelled as he travelled to Moscow to take another onward flight. He later claimed political asylum in Russia, where he currently lives with his partner.U.S. prosecutors\u00a0charged\u00a0Snowden with espionage.EFF executive director Cindy Cohn said that the NSA\u2019s refusal to authenticate the leaked documents \u201cis just another step in its practice of falling back on weak technicalities to prevent the public courts from ruling on whether our Constitution allows this kind of mass surveillance of hundreds of millions of nonsuspect people.\u201dThe EFF said in another filing that the draft report \u201cfurther confirms\u201d the participation of phone companies in the government\u2019s surveillance programs.The case continues \u2014 though, a court hearing has not been set.AT&T collaborates on NSA spying through a web of secretive buildings in the US"}
