{"id": "Tiger Global returns with a $3M investment to help restaurants deal with delivery apps", "paragraph": "Tiger Global has returned to backing early-stage Indian startups after it wrote a $3 million check for CheckMate, a U.S.-Indian startup that helps restaurants deal with the pain of multiple food ordering platforms.The Series A and it represents the first time that CheckMate has raised outside funding for its business. It is also a return to early-stage investing in India \u2014 where CheckMate\u2019s largest office is \u2014 for Tiger Global following a period of relative inactivity.Founded two-and-a-half years ago initially as a bill-splitting app, CheckMate provides a platform that unifies food and payments to ease the chaos of working with modern consumer platforms. In this current age, restaurants simply must work with platforms like Uber Eats,  Postmates, GrubHub, DoorDash and others to get orders, but the services don\u2019t play together, or even with, existing restaurant systems.That means that each service requires its own tablet for managing orders. On top of that, none integrate with order systems that print receipts for chefs or point-of-sale software. That means that restaurant\u00a0staff must not only operate a bunch of iPads to handle the orders, but they have to manually enter them into their ordering systems (to ensure the ticket is processed so the order is cooked), then handle point of sale and bank the order for accounts.That\u2019s a lot of manual hassle, and it\u2019s the core\u00a0issue that CheckMate aims to solve.It effectively operates like a bridge that connects the various delivery platforms to a restaurant\u2019s management system. It\u00a0automatically feeds orders from multiple food delivery services into the ordering system, and feeds the sales back into the restaurant management system. That helps keep the orders moving quickly, whilst managing account and sales without manual input.\u201cOnline orders are still treated as a stepchild that\u2019s alien to the business,\u201d CheckMate founder and CEO\u00a0Vishal Agarwal told TechCrunch in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWith our solution, we inject online orders into the true heart and center of these businesses.\u201dHeadquartered in New York where Agarwal is based, CheckMate has rolled out to more than 1,000 locations in the U.S., and it counts Five Guys\u00a0among its customers. The company recently expanded to Australia with its first customers, and\u00a0Agarwal \u2014 previously with e-commerce company Choxi.com \u2014\u00a0said he is looking for further international growth. The plan to get it, however, is by piggybacking the POS systems it supports, including\u00a0Brink, Toast and Revel, rather than establishing CheckMate\u2019s own sales team.That makes a lot of sense since the POS providers have a major incentive for linking their restaurant customers with CheckMate because it streamlines their operations and makes their life easier. It also helps keep CheckMate lean and mean.The team itself is already lean and international. While Agarwal, who comes from India, is based in New York, the rest of his 10-person U.S. team is distributed, while the operations and tech team of 25 is located in CheckMate\u2019s India office.Because there are no public APIs, CheckMate has built its own platform in conjunction with food delivery services, and now Agarwal \u2014 who said he has invested his own money in CheckMate \u2014\u00a0plans to double down on R&D, and in particular more integrations, by using this Series A raise for hiring.\u201cTechnology in the restaurant sector is under-utilized \u2014 I was coming from an e-commerce background where technology is everywhere,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe quickly realized how much resistance to tech there is and we want to make it as easy as possible for operators to adopt our product.\u201dThat simplicity also applies to CheckMate\u2019s pricing model, which was recently adjusted. Previously, the company charged a set-up fee, but that has been abolished in favor of two tiers: $85 per restaurant for up to two platforms, and $100 for unlimited platforms per location.\u201cAs restaurants streamline their operations to take advantage of rapidly increasing online orders, we\nexpect hundreds of thousands of restaurants to benefit from Checkmate\u2019s unique solution,\u201d Tiger Global partner Scott\u00a0Shleifer said in a prepared statement.The deal is an interesting one for Tiger Global, the 17-year-old New York investment firm that just closed a new $3.75 billion fund. The firm became well-known for writing bold checks that backed ambitious startups in India a couple of years ago before it put the brakes on that strategy.According to a multitude of media reports, the firm\u2019s management grew concerned that it was overexposed in India, where it had deployed some $2 billion via deals in unicorns like Flipkart  and Uber rival Ola. Flipkart\u2019s exit via a majority investment from Walmart, however, made the firm around $3 billion in returns, while it also retained a small stake in the business, which is tipped to have its own IPO\u00a0in the future.Tiger Global executive Lee Fixel, who spearheaded the India strategy, is said to have spent the last year working closely with Flipkart to realize the deal. Now that it is done, Tiger Global is said to be returning to investment mode in India, according to a recent Economic Times story. That means that CheckMate may be the first of many as the tiger begins to roar again."}
