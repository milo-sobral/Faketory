{"id": "AT&T\u2019s streaming video device is now in beta testing", "paragraph": "AT&T has begun beta testing a streaming device that seems to be something of its own Roku competitor, according to a statement made by\u00a0John Donovan,\u00a0CEO of AT&T Communications, during the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call. The device, first scooped a year ago by Variety\u00a0is an Android TV-based set-top box which integrates other streaming apps and ships with a voice remote, according to an\u00a0FCC filing.While AT&T didn\u2019t comment on Variety\u2019s report at the time, it did later confirm the device on an earnings call earlier this year.The box was then described as a way for customers to watch DirecTV Now or other streaming services from their home. The plan at the time was to have the device launched by the end of 2018, the company had said.The word today is that timeframe has shifted.Donovan said the service was in \u201cbeta testing\u201d now, but added that AT&T planned to \u201croll out trials in the first half of next year.\u201dThe thin client-based service \u2013 as this product was referred to as by the exec \u2013 would be the next step in transitioning traditional pay TV customers to the streaming service, DirecTV Now.It could also be used to target cord cutters in search of a more traditional TV experience, by offering access to streaming TV without requiring the installation of a satellite dish.\u201cThis will be a more measured roll out,\u201d Donovan said, of the new thin client-based service. \u201cLike our introduction of WatchTV, we expect this service to be EBITDA positive. And over time, it should lower our acquisition cost of our premium video service. And both of these use the common platform we introduced with DirecTV Now,\u201d he noted.The device\u2019s arrival comes at a time when AT&T\u2019s pay TV business is in decline.The company reported a 346,000 net loss in traditional TV customers (DirecTV and AT&T Uverse) in the quarter. However, it gained 49,000 for its streaming service, DirecTV Now, which has grown to 1.86 million subscribers.AT&T said it would also begin evaluating its channel lineups, in order to better \u201calign content costs with the price.\u201d That seems to mean that AT&T may also be thinking about breaking up content into even skinnier bundles \u2013 something\u00a0Hulu says it\u2019s doing, as well."}
