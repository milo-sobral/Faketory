{"id": "Microsoft could release a disc-less Xbox One", "paragraph": "According to a new report from Thurott, Microsoft has been working on a new console in the Xbox One family. This cheaper model could play regular Xbox One games, but there would be no Blu-Ray drive.This move would lower the price of the entry-level Xbox One. An Xbox One S officially starts at $299 but you can currently find it for around $250 on Amazon. The disc-less Xbox One could start at $199.If you already have an Xbox One and physical games, you could imagine going to an official retailer to trade your discs for a digital download code. Let\u2019s hope that this new Xbox comes with a big hard drive for those who have a slow internet connection.Back when Microsoft  first unveiled the Xbox One in 2013, the company wanted to make a big push toward digital games. The original plan was that you would associate your physical games with your Xbox account. After that, you could play the game even without inserting the disc. Microsoft also planned a way to lend a digital game to a friend for 30 days.After some backlash, Microsoft gave up on this plan and switched back to a more traditional system. But it\u2019s been five years, digital games are more popular than ever and internet connections are faster than ever.Microsoft also thinks the future of games is based on subscriptions. With the Xbox Game Pass, you can access dozens of games for $10 per month. You can also subscribe to EA Access on the Xbox One. Eventually, you could imagine replacing the Xbox altogether with a subscription for a streaming service. But we\u2019re not there yet.According to Thurott, Microsoft is also working on an updated Xbox One S that could be a bit cheaper. This one would have a traditional disc drive."}
