{"id": "Can Apple finish 2018 on a high note? We\u2019ll find out Thursday", "paragraph": "Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ: APPL) has had a great 2018.Even as the other FAANG stocks slumped, the trillion-dollar electronics company has continually satisfied Wall Street with quarter-over-quarter revenue\u00a0growth. But will Apple\u2019s momentum continue after it reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday?The consensus, so far, is yes. Apple  is expected to post\u00a0revenue of $61.43 billion (earnings\u00a0per share of $2.78), an increase of 17 percent year-over-year and GAAP EPS of $2.78, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Investors will be\u00a0paying close attention to iPhone unit sales, which account for the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue, as well as Mac sales, which accounted for roughly 10 percent of the company\u2019s revenue in Q3.The company reported its Q3 earnings on July 31, posting $53.3 billion in revenue, its best June quarter ever and fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, the company said.At today\u2019s hardware event in Brooklyn, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer Tim Cook shared that the company\u2019s Mac business had grown to 100 million monthly active users \u2014 a big accomplishment for the nearly 10-year-old product. Cook also showcased the new MacBook Air\u00a0and introduced the new\u00a0iPad Pro\u00a0and Mac Mini.Not even Lana Del Rey\u2019s surprise performance\u00a0at the event was enough to rile up Wall Street. Apple\u2019s stock was unreactive today, as is typically the case with hardware spectacles like these. Apple ultimately closed up about .5 percent. That\u2019s a better outcome than its last hardware event in September, which despite the highly anticipated announcements of the iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4,\u00a0forced the company\u2019s stock down about 1.2 percent on the news.Apple\u2019s stock performance year to dateYear to date, Apple\u2019s stock has risen more than 30 percent from a February low of $155 per share to an October high of $229.If it fails to meet analyst expectations on Thursday, it\u2019s bad news for the stock market: \u201cApple is the last domino standing,\u201d Market Watch wrote\u00a0earlier today. \u201cIts FAANG brethren have all crashed, even the mighty Amazon, which has slumped about 25% from all-time highs.\u201dIf you missed today\u2019s event, we live-blogged the whole thing\u00a0here\u00a0and detailed all the new hardware here."}
