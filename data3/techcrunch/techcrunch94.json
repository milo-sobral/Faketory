Initially, this includes getting upgraded to Lyft Lux or getting discounts on future rides. The company says it\u2019s considering how to offer other passenger perks, like access to more experienced drivers and double-points days, for example. It\u2019s also listening to customer feedback to hear about other rewards people may want.The company says the program will launch in December 2018 and\u00a0be available to select riders in various cities to start, before rolling out to more riders in 2019.
