{"id": "What does SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son plan to say or do about its ties to Saudi Arabia? We\u2019re about to find out", "paragraph": "Throughout October, it seemed that among others in tech, SoftBank might be forced to rethink its cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, or MBS, who has charmed many captains of industry since rising to power, but whose dark side came into abrupt view over the murder and gruesome disposal of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (MBS has steered Saudi Arabia into plenty of other terribleness, but the brutal end of Khashoggi, a resident of Virginia, a Washington Post columnist, and a critic of MBS, managed to capture the West\u2019s attention in a way that\u00a0tens of thousands of dead Yemeni children\u00a0have not.)Certainly, parting ways with MBS wouldn\u2019t be easy for SoftBank, whose CEO, Masayoshi Son,  has said that his ambitious Vision Fund, which finally closed this past May with $100 billion in commitments, is anchored by MBS. In fact, Son has said that MBS committed $45 billion to the effort in 45 minutes time, and MBS more recently revealed his intention to give SoftBank a separate $45 billion for a second Vision Fund.That\u2019s a lot of money to turn down. Still, for a\u00a0minute, it seemed that SoftBank might legitimately be having second thoughts about whether it\u2019s good to be in business with MBS.\u00a0According to the Financial Times, SoftBank\u2019s COO Marcelo Claure said publicly last month that there was \u201cno certainty\u201d that SoftBank will launch another Vision Fund.Then time passed. Some of the public\u2019s outrage was directed elsewhere. And by the end of this past week, it seemed to be all systems go for SoftBank, which took its finger off the pause button and struck two big deals: plugging $375 million into the robotic food-prep company Zume (with reported plans to invest another $375 million into the company at a later date), and\u00a0announcing on Friday that it has sunk $1.1 billion into View, a maker of glass used in internet-connected windowpanes.Apparently, both companies\u2019 management teams see more to gain from partnering with SoftBank than trying to find other funding sources.The question is whether SoftBank itself will make the same decision as it maps out its own future. And we\u2019re about to find out, seemingly. As the Financial Times notes, Son is reporting SoftBank\u2019s second-quarter results tomorrow, and there\u2019s no question he will be posed a long list of questions about SoftBank\u2019s ties to the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign-wealth fund that MBS controls.Some answers would be helpful, to say the least. To date, Son has said nothing about the Khashoggi case. And though Son skipped an appearance at investment conference organized the week before last by MBS in Riyadh, he met with the prince privately before the event. Our sources say this was to privately express his concern over Khashoggi, but we also get the impression that there was no talk about breaking up the band.We\u2019ll should find out imminently whether that\u2019s right or wrong. Either way, SoftBank\u2019s association with MBS doesn\u2019t look to be forgotten anytime soon. As the FT notes, SoftBank\u2019s shares have fallen fully 26 percent since the fateful day that Khashoggi walked into that Saudi consulate in Turkey in early October and did not come out."}
