{"id": "Original Content podcast: Netflix\u2019s \u2018Hold the Dark\u2019 is beautiful, but utterly mystifying", "paragraph": "\u201cHold the Dark\u201d tells the story of Russell Core (played by Jeffrey Wright), a wolf expert who arrives in the Alaskan village of Keelut to investigate the disappearance of a young boy.At least, that\u2019s how the Netflix  Original movie begins. On this week\u2019s episode of the Original Content podcast, your regular hosts are joined by Devin Coldewey to try to untangle what actually happens in the movie.Without spoiling anything, it\u2019s probably safe to say that \u201cHold the Dark\u201d goes in some surprising directions \u2014 it starts weird and gets weirder (and much more violent), as you can see from our iMessage correspondence below.There\u2019s a talented team at work here \u2014 the movie was directed by Jeremy Saulnier (\u201cGreen Room\u201d), and in addition to Wright, it stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, James Badge Dale and Riley Keough. There\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a gorgeous film, filled with stunning images of the Alaskan wilderness. In the end, though, we weren\u2019t convinced that the wolf-y symbolism and copious bloodshed added up to much of a story.Also, instead of recapping the latest streaming headlines like the usual, Jordan takes a few minutes at the start of the episode to express her admiration for \u201cI Love You, America,\u201d the Sarah Silverman-hosted talk show that recently began its second season on Hulu.You can listen in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts\u00a0or find us in your podcast player of choice.
