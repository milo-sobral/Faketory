{"id": "Pitching a $99 tax advisory service for the masses, Visor has raised $9 million", "paragraph": "The only sure things in this life, according to Ben Franklin, are death and taxes. And a new startup called\u00a0Visor\u00a0has just raised $9 million in financing to make one of them as painless as possible.Unlike Nectome, Visor isn\u2019t \u201c100% fatal\u201c*, but it may ring the death knell for the\u00a0high-end tax advisors that most Americans can\u2019t even access to get help filing and paying their taxes. It\u2019s like having a personalized accountant for the cost of a high-end do-it-yourself tax-prep service.The $9 million Visor raised came from the venture capital firm\u00a0Defy,\u00a0with participation from Unusual Ventures, SVB Capital and existing investors like Obvious Ventures, Fika Ventures and Boxgroup,\u00a0which had put a previous $6.5 million into the company.\u00a0The idea for the company had been percolating for co-founder and chief executive\u00a0Gernot Zacke since he settled in the U.S.\u00a0Growing up in Sweden, Zacke was exposed to a much different process for paying taxes. \u201cThe experience of filing taxes in Sweden is that you receive a message from the government that stated how much you made and how much you were withholding. That\u2019s it,\u201d said Zacke. \u201cTaxes should be as easy as ordering a cab.\u201dThat\u2019s the service that Visor aims to provide.\u201cIf you think about the market there are two ways to get your taxes done. There\u2019s the DIY space and then there are other online services but it requires the tax payer to fill out the forms and it leaves the tax payer with a little bit of anxiety,\u201d said Zacke. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering the CPA experience through the convenience of a web app and a mobile app.\u201dOn average, Americans spend about 13 hours each year dealing with taxes, and the average American doesn\u2019t have the benefits of a professional advisor who can help optimize the process. That\u2019s what Visor wants to provide.\u201cYou provide the same amount of information you provide to a CPA or TurboTax\u2026 we make sure that that information is filed securely on AWS and shared between the docs and the backend,\u201d said Zacke.\u00a0The target customers for Zacke\u2019s services are folks who have had a change to their tax situation \u2014 whether moving, buying a home or any other life event; or folks who have had a CPA and don\u2019t want to pay the higher fees, he said.Visor currently has an operations team of around 34 people split between San Francisco and Atlanta.For Zacke, the pain point he\u2019s solving with the Visor service is very real. A former employee of the European investment firm Atomico,  Zacke bounced between the U.S. and Europe \u2014 eventually running U.S. investments for the firm before leaving to launch Visor.Other co-founders and senior executives hail from the tax advisory world, and from employee benefits outsourcing services company Zenefits,  along with former Venmo  and Square developers.\u201cTaxpayers spend $20 billion a year to get their taxes prepared and are stuck between spending hours filling out DIY tax software and hiring an expensive CPA,\u201d said Zacke, in a statement. \u201c*After a lengthy conversation with Nectome\u2019s public relations rep, it\u2019s worth noting that the company is apparently not working with human subjects (or is no longer working with human subjects?). It has taken deposits totaling $200,000 from people who want to use its services, according to multiple\u00a0reports."}
