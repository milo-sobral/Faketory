Today, Google is expanding the Mini Stickers with the launch of what it calls \u201cEmoji Minis\u201d \u2013 meaning, emoji-sized stickers that look like you.Similar to the initial launch of Mini stickers, the new emoji are also created using machine learning techniques, Google says.The company said the idea is to give people a way to use emoji they feel better represent who they really are.\u201cEmoji Minis are designed for those who may have stared into the eyes of emoji and not seen yourself staring back,\u201d explained Google, in a blog post. \u201cThese sticker versions of the emoji you use every day are customizable so you can make them look just like you.\u201dThat means your emoji can have differently colored hair \u2013 like green or blue or gray, for example \u2013 or piercings. It can be wearing a hat, head covering, or glasses.Google says it uses neural networks to suggest skin tones, hairstyles, and accessories that you can then fine tune. You can choose a color for your hair, facial hair, or select different types of head covering and eyewear. You can also add freckles or wrinkles, if you want.The result is a not just a single emoji, but a selection of options. For example, you can use your custom emoji as a zombie, mage, heart eyes, crying eyes, shruggie, and all the others.This the third style of\u00a0Mini stickers, first introduced last year. Already, these stickers come in two other styles \u2013 a more expressive \u201cbold\u201d and a nicer \u201csweet.\u201dWhile it may seem like a minor thing, creative emoji \u2013 and specifically, personalized emoji \u2013 can be a big draw for messaging apps. Apple advertises its clever Animoji and personalized Memoji\u00a0as flagship features of its newer Face ID-powered phones. Snapchat bought Bitmoji (Bitstrips) to give its users access to more tools for creative expression. Samsung lets you make your own AR emoji that look like you. And people celebrated when the Unicode Consortium diversified to include more skin tones, and added, at long last, redheads.Gboard, whose app has been downloaded over a billion times on Google Play, has a similar draw, thanks to its selfie-based stickers.The company says the new Emoji Minis are available in all Gboard languages and countries, on both iOS and Android, starting today."}
