{"id": "GM is getting into the electric bike business", "paragraph": "General Motors said it plans to bring two new electric bikes to market next year \u2014 one folding and one compact \u2014 as the automaker makes a broader push into electrification and other ideas that try to move beyond its traditional business model of producing and selling gas-power vehicles.The automaker didn\u2019t have a lot of information to share about the e-bikes or its ultimate plans. For instance,\u00a0Hannah Parish, director of General Motors Urban Mobility Solutions, wouldn\u2019t say if GM plans to launch a bike-sharing service as a result of these two new products.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say anything is on or off the table at this point,\u201d she added.Here\u2019s what is on the menu. The bikes will be \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cconnected\u201d and somehow inspired by GM\u2019s OnStar, the company\u2019s subscription-based communications, in-vehicle security and emergency services feature found in cars. Parish wouldn\u2019t elaborate what that might look like. We\u2019ll have to wait until next year.The bikes are also equipped with safety features including rechargeable front and rear LED lights. And the electric propulsion on the bikes were designed by GM engineers who created a proprietary drive system.\u00a0\u201cWe know that people who live in urban areas, like myself in downtown Toronto need different opportunities to use different types of transportation when they going and doing different things. We know that congestion in cities is a problem and the e-bikes feed right into our efforts,\u201d Parish, director of General Motors Urban Mobility Solutions told TechCrunch.\u00a0GM revealed two eBikes \u2013 one folding and one compact.For now, GM is focused on naming the e-bikes. And it\u2019s turning to the public to help. The company launched a brand-naming campaign Friday as part of its broader e-bike announcement. Folks who want to name the e-bikes can go to\u00a0www.eBikeBrandChallenge.com. The participant with the winning selection will receive $10,000.
