{"id": "Voting is a social experience", "paragraph": "If your Instagram followers aren\u2019t aware that you\u2019ve voted, did you really even vote?In 2018, the act of voting is great social media fodder. People want their friends to know they\u2019ve registered to vote, or that they\u2019ve just mailed in their absentee ballot or even that they\u2019ve bought some sort of \u201clook, I voted\u201d t-shirt.\u00a0These announcements are being shared across social platforms like it\u2019s a required part of the voting process.Whether or not those people only voted for the likes doesn\u2019t really matter, the important thing is that they voted. Social media, because of the unprecedented access it grants people to the lives of their peers and influencers, is an effective strategy of pushing eligible voters to the polls. Why? Because people care about their friends and often even more about what their friends think of them. No one wants to be that friend that didn\u2019t vote.Vote.org\u00a0and\u00a0Outvote, a texting app for political campaigns, have taken note. The nonprofit platform for voter registration, information and advocacy has teamed up with the Y Combinator graduate to launch a new nonpartisan social media app that syncs with a user\u2019s address book to help them quickly and efficiently remind their friends to check their registration status, find their polling place location and vote.According to Outvote\u2019s research, one text message from a known contact made people 10 percent more likely to vote versus 8 percent from a typical conversation with a political canvasser. Using the app, you can essentially perform 2 hours of canvassing in 5 minutes, from the comfort of your own bed.\u201cThis November, reminding your friends is your new civic duty,\u201d Outvote co-founder Naseem Makiya said in a statement.\u00a0Outvote\u2019s flagship app is tailored for Democrats and is meant to inspire and personalize grassroots-style campaigning. Using that app, you can send messages to your friends using Facebook Messenger, too, though the app doesn\u2019t sync with any contacts outside of your phone\u2019s address book. In addition to YC backing, Outvote has raised $300,000 in seed funding. The startup was founded by\u00a0Makiya, formerly of startups Moovweb and DataCamp, as well as\u00a0Nadeem Mazen, the former chief executive officer of a creative agency called Nimblebot.\u00a0\u00a0Something I wish I knew about when I was 18 and voting for the first time: \u2728EARLY VOTING\u2728. It makes it so quick and easy to go and cast your vote before November 6. Early voting starts TODAY in Tennessee and goes to Nov 1 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 You can check out your state\u2019s early voting dates at the link in my bioA post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 17, 2018 at 6:02am PDTAxios reported earlier today that while TV and email campaigns are still used by political campaigns, text messaging has proven to be a whole lot more successful. Per Opn Sesame,\u00a090 percent of text messages are read within 5 minutes: \u201cThat intimate delivery, and the ability to target and personalize messages, is what makes them so effective for campaigns \u2014 but also annoying for many voters who didn\u2019t sign up for them,\u201d Axios\u2019 Kim Hart wrote.Social media companies, other avenues for targeted and personalized messaging, have stepped up their voter education efforts ahead of the midterm elections.Snap announced yesterday that after adding a vote button to its app, more than 400,000 of its users registered to vote via TurboVote. Meanwhile,\u00a0Facebook and Twitter have added small reminders to their feeds, as have Reddit, Tinder, Bumble, Lyft and several other big tech companies.Instagram, for its part, has Taylor Swift. Her recent social media campaign, beginning with a post\u00a0earlier this month prodding her fans to vote, caused a big spike in voter registrations. According to Vote.org, 65,000 people registered to vote in the 24-hour period that followed her first-ever politically fueled gram.Since then, Swift has been sharing on her Instagram story images of her fans who voted. It\u2019s her reward to those who followed her advice to express their political opinions. So vote, and you may be featured on a pop star\u2019s Instagram. That\u2019s 2018 for you.Outvote hopes to flip elections by getting Democrats to text their friends"}
