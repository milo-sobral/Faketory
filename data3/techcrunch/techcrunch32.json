{"id": "Southeast Asia\u2019s Grab partners with MasterCard to offer prepaid cards", "paragraph": "Ride-hailing firm Grab branched out into payments last year and now the $11 billion-valued company, which acquired Uber\u2019s Southeast Asia business earlier this year, has given its fintech division a major boost after it announced plans to introduce virtual prepaid in partnership with Mastercard.The move is the largest digital payment push in Southeast Asia to date.\u00a0The deal will see its Grab  Pay business offer Grab\u2019s 110 million registered users the option to use a virtual Mastercard to make payments both online and in-person.Users will be able to use physical Grab Pay cards or virtual ones \u2014 the latter being a card number, expiry date, and other details that are held within the Grab app. Interestingly, TechCrunch understands that Grab had been in contact with Visa over a similar deal but it ultimately chose MasterCard . Grab declined to comment on that when asked.Regardless of the issuer, the deal instantly gives Grab Pay the potential for serious legs.Last November, Grab launched its first payment integration by allowing users in Singapore to pay for food at selected restaurants using its app. While it has expanded that support in Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia, it has needed to onboard merchants to do so. Now, with MasterCard, it is tapping into a vast network of three million retailers across Southeast Asia, with support for worldwide and also via online merchants.That turns Grab Pay into a serious payment network on paper, but it will also give a large chunk of Southeast Asia\u2019s 650 million population a chance to own plastic for the first time.While the region\u2019s middle-class is growing quickly as internet access continues to increase \u2014 Southeast Asia\u2019s internet population is larger than the total U.S. population, and growing \u2014 few people have a card.Many, in fact, remain unbanked. The World Bank claims 71 percent of the region is paid their salary in cash while just 30 percent own a debit card and only nine percent have a credit card. Many simply don\u2019t qualify to own one. Grab\u2019s effort, which is the largest pre-paid push in the region, could make a difference.\u2018Could\u2019 is very much the operative word here. While Grab has made progress with Grab Pay \u2014 which also runs\u00a0an offline merchant network that enables those with limited internet knowledge to take advantage of e-commerce and other online services \u2014 the service is intrinsically linked to Grab.Grab Pay can now exist as a standalone service. The question is whether Grab can market the virtual card service effectively and tap the undoubted potential that it has for its business and consumers in Southeast Asia. To date, no fintech firm has managed to build a regional network that covers over 100 million consumers, although there are plenty of promising challengers that have started out in a single market right. While Grab\u2019s efforts have been periphery and, based on anecdotal evidence, not all users are convinced they need Grab Pay in their life.Grab though is confident that its raft of non-transportation \u2014 which includes food deliveries, grocery deliveries and\u00a0third-party services on its platform \u2014 can make the Mastercard venture work.\u201cWe see Grab Pay as a glue that goes across all the products we offer, and rewards our users for using them,\u201d Reuben Lai, senior\u00a0managing director at Grab Financial, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cGrab Pay users spend two times more than regular users and they stay twice longer on our platform.\u201dLai added that those who use Grab Pay are 30 percent more likely to use other Grab services \u2014 they, it seems, are the power users \u2014 but he added that Grab\u2019s mission, beyond increasing engagement, is to digitize payments in Southeast Asia.\u201cWhat we want to do next is democratize payments and access to financial services,\u201d he said. \u201cMany consumers don\u2019t have access to the things we take for granted, we want to make these available to our users, drivers and partners.\u201dJust as Grab founders Hooi Ling Tan and Anthony Tan have said that street hailing is Grab\u2019s biggest competitor, so Lai suggested that cash is the biggest rival to Grab Pay right now.That\u2019s certainly true since the deal with Uber  removed Grab\u2019s main competitor from the eight markets that it serves in Southeast Asia, but regulators are keen to see increased competition. Singapore fined Uber and Grab a collective $9.5 million from what it deemed to be an \u201canti-competitive\u201d merger deal while the Philippines followed suit with a far smaller $300,000 wrap on the knuckles.That shock to the system, coupled with a consumer backlash around more limited choice and a bodged effort to revamp Grab\u2019s loyalty program, has seen Grab admit for the first time that it needs to rebuild ties. The MasterCard deal has the potential to be useful if executed right, but many Grab users will be looking for it to shore up on the basics, with complaints centered around issues like driver reliability and fair pricing.That\u2019s right, in the absence of Uber, Grab is learning that it isn\u2019t easy being the top dog. But that status does give it the potential to work on major new products and with huge partners like MasterCard. A deal like this was unthinkable when Grab was the scrappy underdog, but now it\u2019s a company that raises billions on a regular basis and is a category leader."}
