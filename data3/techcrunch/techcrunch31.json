{"id": "NBC to launch a new streaming network, NBC News Signal", "paragraph": "NBC is looking to reach a younger audience with today\u2019s announcement of a new streaming news network, NBC News Signal. Instead of airing on traditional pay TV platforms, Signal will be available through NBC\u2019s news mobile and over-the-top apps, as well as on other services including PlutoTV, YouTube, and Twitter. The focus will be on the \u201cpolitical and social issues in America,\u201d the company says.The service will include an evening show hosted by\u00a0Simone Boyce at 7 PM ET on weekdays. At launch, this program is available on Thursdays at 7 PM ET only. Other programming consists of\u00a0a morning and afternoon show and hourly news updates called \u201cBrieflies,\u201d which launches later this quarter and in early 2019.There will also be a\u00a0Steve Kornacki-hosted digital show \u201c218: Race for the House\u201d which will air daily at 12pm ET and on Election Day, November 6th; as well as a Katy Tur-hosted pre-show on the network from 7-9pm ET.The channel will have 24/7 news coverage starting in mid-2019, NBC says.\u201cThere is a growing segment of people who have never had a cable subscription, but who are just as hungry for smart news as the prior generations of news watchers who have consumed NBC News for decades,\u201d said Nick Ascheim, SVP of digital at NBC News Group, about the launch. \u201cThese consumers \u2013 who are up-to-date on the headlines but are seeking a deeper understanding of the news of the moment \u2013 are increasingly turning to OTT devices for \u2018lean back\u2019 news consumption or an on-the-go informative experience and that\u2019s exactly what NBC News Signal will deliver,\u201d he added.The streaming network isn\u2019t NBC\u2019s only attempt at wooing millennial viewers. The company also operates a Snapchat show called \u201cStay Tuned.\u201dHowever, it is now one of many digital-first initiatives in the news industry, aimed to reach the younger, cord cutter crowd.CBS last year added streaming news from CBSN to its offering for cord cutters, CBS All Access, which it plans on augmenting with local news\u00a0from CBS stations.Fox News will soon launch its own over-the-top streaming service, Fox Nation. ABC\u2019s new streaming network ABC News Live partnered with Roku to be featured on its devices\u2019 free channel.Meanwhile, Cheddar has been doing deals left-and-right with various streaming TV services for inclusion in their lineups.There\u2019s also VICE News Tonight on HBO, and others, like Plex\u2019s news service, based on its Watchup acquisition.Plus, today\u2019s youngest users \u2013 like many of us \u2013 get a lot of their news from social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter. That means NBC\u2019s Signal will have a lot of competition fresh out of the gate.Erica Fink and Christine Cataldi are the executive producers for the network. Rashida Jones, SVP of specials for\u00a0NBC\u00a0News and MSNBC, is the executive in charge of programming for\u00a0NBC\u00a0News\u00a0Signal.The service is available here,\u00a0and across the above-mentioned platforms."}
