{"id": "ZypMedia raises $5.6M to help traditional media companies embrace online ads", "paragraph": "Local advertising startup ZypMedia is announcing that it has raised $5.6 million in Series C funding.That\u2019s a relatively small amount of money for a Series C (the company had previously raised $6.9 million total, according to Crunchbase), but co-founder Aman Sareen said, \u201cWe had the opportunity to raise a lot more, but we chose not to.\u201d In fact, Sareen said ZypMedia became profitable last year.So the new funding round should allow the company to continue expanding its product lineup and its team \u2014 it has plans to double its headcount in the United States and India over the next year \u2014 while still leaving room for organic growth.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be a cautionary tale [like] other previous adtech companies,\u201d Sareen said. \u201cWe are buckling down for the long haul \u2026 We didn\u2019t want to necessarily raise money just for the sake of it.\u201dSareen founded ZypMedia with his former college roommate Ramandeep Ahuja, as well as former Current TV executive Mark Goldman, with the aim of helping local broadcasters move into programmatic advertising.The idea is to help those media companies offer campaigns that can reach advertisers\u2019 desired audiences across traditional and digital channels, such as display, video (including over-the-top), social media and native advertising.\u201cLocal digital advertising has been very neglected,\u201d Sareen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market, and our goal was to be one of the leaders. I\u2019ll be honest, it wasn\u2019t an easy to task, but we have been decently successful in our mission.\u201d\u201cDecently successful\u201d means signing up partners like Sinclair Broadcast Group and Univision. It also means enlisting Archer Venture Capital as the lead investor in the new round. (Existing investors US Venture Partners and Sinclair also participated.)\u201cNot only have Aman and Ramandeep created a superior tech stack for delivering local advertising, they\u2019ve also developed a really smart and defensible business model, partnering with local media companies to act as their direct sales force,\u201d said Archer Managing Director John Hadl in the funding announcement.And ultimately, the vision goes beyond bringing incremental revenue to traditional media companies. Sareen argued that ZypMedia\u2019s model positions it right at the intersection of traditional and digital advertising.\u201cWithin the next two-to-five years, digital or linear, over-the-top or over-the-air, it will jump through one platform,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything will use the same technology and currency.\u201d"}
