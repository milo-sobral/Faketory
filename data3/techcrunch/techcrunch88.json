{"id": "Twitter, those \u2018verified\u2019 bitcoin-pushing pillocks are pissing everyone off", "paragraph": "Elon Musk\u2019s tweets piss me off for two reasons.When he\u2019s not accusing actual heroes of sex crimes or trolling the federal government, it\u2019s what comes after that drives me batshit. The top reply to most of his tweets is some asshat impersonating him to try to trick his followers into falling for a bitcoin scam.These \u201cget rich quick\u201d scams are fairly simple. A hacker hijacks a verified Twitter account using stolen or leaked passwords. Then, the hacker swaps the account\u2019s name, bio and photo \u2014 almost always to mirror Elon Musk \u2014 and drops a reply with \u201chere\u2019s where to send your bitcoin,\u201d or something similar.The end result appears as though Musk is responding to his own tweet, and nudging hapless bitcoin owners to drop their coins into the scammer\u2019s coffers.One of the latest \u201cvictims\u201d was @FarahMenswear. The clothing retailer \u2014 with some 15,500 followers \u2014 was hacked this morning to promote a \u201cbitcoin giveaway.\u201d In the short time the scam began, the bitcoin address already had more than 100 transactions and over\u00a05.84 bitcoins \u2014 that\u2019s $37,000 in just a few hours\u2019 work. Many Twitter users said that the scammers \u201cpromoted\u201d the tweet \u2014 amplifying the scam to reach many more people.On one hand, this scam is depressingly easy to pull off that even I could\u2019ve done it. Depressing on the other, because that\u2019s half a year\u2019s wages for the average reporter.Still, that $37,000 is a drop in the ocean to some of the other successful scam artists out there. One scammer last week, this time using @PantheonBooks, made $180,000 in a single day by tricking people into turning over their bitcoin and promising great returns.Another day, another Elon Musk-themed bitcoin scam. (Image: screenshot)Why is the scam so easy?Granted, it\u2019s clever. But it\u2019s a widespread problem that can be largely attributed to Twitter\u2019s  nonchalant, \u201claissez-faire\u201d approach to account security.The common thread to all of these cryptocurrency scams involve hijacking accounts. Often, hackers use credential stuffing \u2014 that\u2019s using the same passwords stolen from other breaches on other sites and services \u2014 to break into Twitter accounts. In nearly all successful cases, the hacked Twitter accounts aren\u2019t protected with two-factor authentication. Brand accounts shared by multiple social media users almost never use two-factor, because it\u2019s hard to share access tokens.A Twitter spokesperson said it\u2019s improved how it handles cryptocurrency scams and has seen a significant reduction in the amount of users who see scammy tweets. The company also said that scammers are constantly changing their methods, and Twitter is trying to stay one step ahead. In many cases, these scams are nuked from the site before they\u2019re even reported.And, Twitter said it regularly reminds account owners to switch on stronger security settings, like two-factor authentication.Well, enough\u2019s enough, Twitter. You can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink. So maybe it\u2019s about time you bring the water a little closer.Until something better comes along, Twitter should make two-factor authentication mandatory for verified accounts, especially high-profile accounts \u2014 like politicians. It\u2019s no more of an inconvenience than switching on two-factor for your email inbox or other social networking account. The settings are already there \u2014 it even rolled out the more secure app-based authentication a year ago to give users the option of switching from the less-secure text message system.If the only other option is to stop Elon Musk from tweeting\u2026"}
