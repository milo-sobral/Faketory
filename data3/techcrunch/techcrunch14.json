{"id": "Alumni Ventures Group is the most active venture fund you\u2019ve never heard of", "paragraph": "Alumni Ventures Group\u2019s (AVG) limited partners aren\u2019t endowment or pension funds. Its typical LP is\u00a0a heart surgeon in Des Moines, Iowa.The firm has both an unorthodox model of fundraising and dealmaking. Across 25 micro funds,\u00a0AVG is raising and investing upwards of $200 million per year for and in tech startups.Tucked away in Boston, far from the limelight of Silicon Valley, few seem to be paying attention to AVG. There are a few reasons why, and those seem to be working to the firm\u2019s advantage.Today, AVG is announcing a close of roughly $30 million for three additional funds: Green D Ventures, Chestnut Street Ventures and Purple Arch Ventures, which represent capital committed by Dartmouth, the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern alums, respectively.AVG walks and talks like a venture fund, but a peek under the hood reveals its unconventional fundraising mechanisms.Rather than collecting $5 million minimum investments from institutional LPs, AVG takes $50,000 directly from individual alums of prestigious universities. The firm pools the capital and creates university-specific venture funds for graduates of\u00a0Duke, Stanford, Harvard, MIT and several other colleges.\u00a0\u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what to make of us because we\u2019re so different,\u201d said Michael Collins, AVG\u2019s founder and chief executive officer.Collins started AVG to make venture capital more accessible to individual people. He\u2019s been a VC since 1986, formerly of TA Associates, and had grown tired of the hubris that runs rampant in the industry. In 2014, he started a $1.5 million fund for alums of his alma mater, Dartmouth. Since then, AVG has grown into 25 funds, each of which fundraise annually and are\u00a0seeing substantial growth over their previous raises. \u201cWhat we observed is VC is a really good asset class but it\u2019s really designed for institutional investors,\u201d Collins (pictured below) said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for individual people to put together a smart, simple portfolio unless they do it themselves. That\u2019s why we created AVG.\u201dAVG and its team of 40 investment professionals make 150 to 200 investments per year of roughly $1 million each in U.S. startups across industries. In the second quarter of 2018,\u00a0PitchBook listed the firm as the second most active global investor, ranked below only Plug and Play Tech Center and above the likes of Kleiner Perkins, NEA and Accel.\u00a0Unlike the Kleiners, NEAs and Accels of the world, AVG never leads investments. Collins says they just \u201ctuck themselves into\u201d a deal with a great lead investor. They don\u2019t take board seats; Collins says he doesn\u2019t see any value in more than one VC on a company board. And they don\u2019t try to negotiate deal terms. Though unusual, all of this works to their advantage. Founders appreciate the easy capital and access to AVG\u2019s network, and other VC firms don\u2019t view AVG as a threat, making it easier for the firm to get in on great deals.\u201cWe are low friction, we are small and we have a hell of a Rolodex,\u201d Collins said. Despite a deal flow that\u2019s unmatched by many VC firms, AVG manages to fly under the radar \u2014 and the firm is totally OK with that.\u201cA lot of VC is a bit of a star business where people try to build their own individual brand,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey get out there; they like publicity; they blog; they speak at conferences; they want to be known as the person to bring great deals to. We don\u2019t lead. We work in the background. We just don\u2019t feel the need to put the energy into PR.\u201d\u201cMost VC returns are really achieved through investing in great companies as opposed to changing the trajectory of a company because you\u2019re on the board,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you\u2019re a seed investor in Airbnb or Google, you were really great to be an early investor in that company, not because you sat on the board and you\u2019re brilliance created Google\u2019s success.\u201dAVG has completed 115 investments in the last 12 months. It\u2019s investing out of 10-year funds, so at just four years in, it has some more waiting to do before it\u2019ll see the full outcomes of its investments. Still, Collins says 65 of their portfolio companies have had liquidity events or up rounds so far, including Jump, which sold to Uber in April, and Whistle, acquired by Mars Petcare a few years back.\u201cI hope that we can be a catalyst to bring more people into this asset class,\u201d he concluded.\u201cI am a big believer that it\u2019s really important that America continues to lead in entrepreneurship and I think the more people that own this asset class the better.\u201dBase10\u2019s debut fund is the largest ever for a Black-led VC firm"}
