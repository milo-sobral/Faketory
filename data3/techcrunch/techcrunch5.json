Hackers targeted the behind-the-scenes system that insurance agents used to help customers directly enroll in new plans, and not the consumer Healthcare.gov site itself.\u00a0In order to sign up for healthcare plans, customers have to give over a ton of personal data \u2014 including names, addresses, and their social security number. CMS didn\u2019t say exactly what kind of data was included in the stolen files, nor did it say how the breach happened.Spokesperson Jonathan Monroe didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.CMS said that the Healthcare.gov website was unaffected. Open enrollment in new healthcare plans \u2014 set for November 1 \u2014 will be unaffected, the statement said.\u00a0Officials are \u201cworking to identify the individuals potentially impacted as quickly as possible so that we can notify them and provide resources such as credit protection.\u201d"}
