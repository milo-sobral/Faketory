Historically, Sequoia didn\u2019t have much interest in the medical sector.\u00a0 Health was one of the\u00a0firm\u2019s smallest investment categories, and it participated in only three health-related deals from 2015-16, making up just 4% of\u00a0its total investing activity.\u00a0Recently, however, life sciences have piqued Sequoia\u2019s fascination, confirms a spokesperson with the firm.\u00a0 Sequoia dove into six health-related deals in 2017 and has already participated in 14 in 2018 so far.\u00a0 The firm now sits among the most active health investors in China and the medical sector has become its second biggest investment area, with life science and biotech companies accounting for nearly 30% of its investing activity in recent years.Health-related investment data for 2015-18 compiled from Pitchbook, Crunchbase, and SEC EdgarThere\u2019s no shortage of areas in need of transformation within Chinese medical care, and a wide range of strategies are being employed by China\u2019s VCs.\u00a0While some investors hope to address\u00a0influenza, others are focused on innovative treatments for hypertension, diabetes and other chronic diseases.For instance, according to the Chinese Journal of Cancer, in 2015, 36% of world\u2019s lung cancer diagnoses came from China, yet the country\u2019s cancer survival rate was 17% below the global average.\u00a0Sequoia has set its sights on tackling China\u2019s high rate of cancer and its low survival rate, with roughly 70% of its deals in the past two years focusing on cancer detection and treatment.That is driven in part by investments like the firm\u2019s $90 million Series A investment into Shanghai-based JW Therapeutics, a company developing innovative immunotherapy cancer treatments.\u00a0The company is a quintessential example of how Chinese VCs are building the country\u2019s next set of health startups using their international footprints and learnings from across the globe.Founded as a joint-venture offshoot between US-based Juno Therapeutics and China\u2019s WuXi AppTec, JW benefits from Juno\u2019s experience as a top developer of cancer immunotherapy drugs, as well as WuXi\u2019s expertise as one of the world\u2019s leading contract research organizations, focusing on all aspects of the drug R&D and development cycle.Specifically, JW is focused on the next-generation of cell-based immunotherapy cancer treatments using chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technologies. (Yeah\u2026I know\u2026)\u00a0For the WebMD warriors and the rest of us with a medical background that stopped at tenth-grade chemistry, CAR-T essentially looks to attack cancer cells by utilizing the body\u2019s own immune system.Past waves of biotech startups often focused on other immunologic treatments that\u00a0used genetically-modified antibodies created in animals.\u00a0 The antibodies would effectively act as \u201cpolice,\u201d identifying and attaching to \u201cbad guy\u201d targets in order to turn off or quiet down malignant cells.\u00a0 CAR-T looks instead to modify the body\u2019s native immune cells to attack and kill the bad guys directly.Chinese VCs are investing in a\u00a0wide range of innovative life science and biotech startups.

As such, Chinese venture firms are now increasingly searching for innovation abroad, looking to capitalize on expanding opportunities in the more mature US medical industry that can offer innovative technologies and advanced processes that can be brought back to the East.In April, Qiming Venture Partners, another Chinese venture titan, closed a $120 million fund focused on early-stage US healthcare. Qiming has been ramping up its participation in the medical space, investing in 24 companies over the 2017-18 period.New firms diving into the space hasn\u2019t frightened the Bay Area\u2019s notable investors, who have doubled down in the US medical space alongside their Chinese counterparts.Partner directories for America\u2019s most influential firms are increasingly populated with former doctors and medically-versed VCs who can find the best medical startups and have a growing influence on the flow of venture dollars in the US.At the top of the list is Krishna Yeshwant, the GV (formerly Google Ventures) general partner leading the firm\u2019s aggressive push into the medical industry.Krishna Yeshwant (GV) at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017A doctor by trade, Yeshwant\u2019s interest runs the gamut of the medical spectrum, leading investments focusing on anything from real-time patient care insights to antibody and therapeutic technologies for cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.Per data from Pitchbook and Crunchbase, Krishna has been GV\u2019s most active partner over the past two years, participating in deals that total over a billion dollars in aggregate funding.Backed by the efforts of Yeshwant and select others, the medical industry has become one of the\u00a0most prominent investment areas for Google\u2019s venture capital arm, driving roughly 30% of its investments in 2017 compared to just under 15% in 2015.GV\u2019s affinity for medical-investing has found renewed life, but life science is also part of the firm\u2019s DNA.\u00a0 Like many brand-name Valley investors, GV founder Bill Maris has long held a passion for the health startups.\u00a0 After leaving GV in 2016, Maris launched his own fund, Section 32, focused specifically on biotech, healthcare and life sciences.\u00a0In the same vein, life science and health investing has been part of the lifeblood for some major US funds including Founders Fund, which has consistently dedicated over 25% of its deployed capital to the space since at least 2015.The tides may be changing, however, as the recent expansion of oversight for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) may severely impact the flow of Chinese capital into areas of the US health sector.\u00a0 Under its extended purview, CFIUS will review \u2013 and possibly block \u2013 any investment or transaction involving a foreign entity related to the production, design or testing of technology that falls under a list of 27 critical industries, including biotech research and development.The true implications of the expanded rules will depend on how aggressively and how often CFIUS exercises its power.\u00a0 But a lengthy review process and the threat of regulatory blocks may significantly increase the burden on Chinese investors, effectively shutting off the Chinese money spigot.Regardless of CFIUS, while China\u2019s active presence in the US health markets hasn\u2019t deterred Valley mainstays, with a severely broken health system and an improved investment environment backed by government support, China\u2019s commitment to medical innovation is only getting stronger.Deficiencies in China\u2019s health sector has historically led to troublesome outcomes.\u00a0 Now the government is jump-starting investment through supportive policy. (Photo by Alexander Tessmer / EyeEm via Getty Images)They say successful startups identify real problems that need solving.\u00a0Marred with inefficiencies, poor results, and compounding consumer frustration, China\u2019s health industry has many.\u00a0Outside of a wealthy few, citizens are forced to make often lengthy treks to overcrowded and understaffed hospitals in urban centers.\u00a0 Reception areas exist only in concept, as any open space is quickly filled by hordes of the concerned, sick, and fearful settling in for wait times that can last multiple days.\u00a0If and when patients are finally seen, they are frequently met by overworked or inexperienced medical staff, rushing to get people in and out in hopes of servicing the endless line behind them.\u00a0Historically, when patients were diagnosed, treatment options were limited and ineffective, as import laws and affordability issues made many globally approved drugs unavailable.As one would assume, poor detection and treatment have led to problematic outcomes.\u00a0Heart disease, stroke, diabetes and chronic lung disease accounts for 80% of deaths in China, according to a recent report from the World Bank.\u00a0Recurring issues of misconduct, deception and dishonesty have amplified the population\u2019s mounting frustration. After past cases of widespread sickness caused by improperly handled vaccinations, China\u2019s vaccine crisis reached a breaking point earlier this year.\u00a0 It was revealed that 250,000 children had been given defective and fallacious rabies vaccinations, a fact that inspectors had discovered months prior and swept under the rug.Fracturing public trust around medical treatment has serious, potentially destabilizing effects.\u00a0And with deficiencies permeating nearly all aspects of China\u2019s health and medical infrastructure, there is a gaping set of opportunities for disruptive change.In response to these issues, China\u2019s government placed more emphasis on the search for medical innovation by rolling out policies that improve the chances of success for health startups, while reducing costs and risk for investors.Billions of public investment flooded into the life science sector, and easier approval processes for patents, research grants, and generic drugs, suddenly made the prospect of building a life science or biotech company in China less daunting.\u00a0For Chinese venture capitalists, on top of financial incentives and a higher-growth local medical sector, loosening of drug import laws opened up opportunities to improve China\u2019s medical system through innovation abroad. Liquidity has also improved due to swelling global interest in healthcare. Plus, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange recently announced changes to allow the listing of pre-revenue biotech companies.The changes implemented across China\u2019s major institutions have effectively provided Chinese health investors with a much broader opportunity set, faster growth companies, faster liquidity, and increased certainty, all at lower cost.However, while the structural and regulatory changes in China\u2019s healthcare\u00a0system has led to more medical startups with more growth, it hasn\u2019t necessarily driven quality.US and Western investors haven\u2019t taken the same cross-border approach as their peers in Beijing.\u00a0From talking with those in the industry, the laxity of the Chinese system, and others, have made many US investors weary of investing in life science companies overseas.And with the Valley similarly stepping up its focus on startups that sprout from the strong American university system, bubbling valuations have started to raise concern.But with China dedicating more and more billions across the globe, the country is determined to\u00a0patch the massive holes in its medical system and establish itself as the next leader in international health innovation."}
