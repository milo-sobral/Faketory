{"id": "The team behind XOXO is taking over Kickstarter\u2019s Drip crowdfunding community", "paragraph": "Two years ago, Kickstarter acquired Drip, an indie musician crowdfunding platform, on the eve of the service\u2019s untimely demise. After relaunching Drip last year, Kickstarter is again reinventing the Patreon-like artist platform. This time, by placing it under the stewardship of two guys who love indie creators so much they dreamed up a whole festival about it.The idea grew out of conversations between Kickstarter principal founder Perry Chen and Andy Baio, Kickstarter\u2019s  former (and first) chief technology officer and one half of XOXO Fest, a sometimes annual, very beloved celebration of independent artists and creators. XOXO co-founder Andy McMillan will join Baio on the project, with an undisclosed round of seed funding provided by Kickstarter.Kickstarter buys Drip, a community for independent musicians\u201cAndy [McMillan] and I had been thinking about this for some time,\u201d Baio said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThe whole thing being about celebrating independent artists, bringing them together to talk about difficult things\u2026 So much of what we\u2019ve focused on was that: helping independent artists who use the internet to make a living.\u201dThe two Andys (as they\u2019re known at XOXO) maintain a very active year-round Slack composed of former XOXO attendees, a responsibility that\u2019s seen them grow into their role as stewards of a community that\u2019s taken on a life of its own, both online and off. For their new project \u2014 the evolution of Drip into a yet-to-be-named community and crowdfunding hub \u2014 Baio and McMillan have formed a public-benefit corporation to reflect their values and those of Kickstarter, also a public-benefit corporation. Chen clarifies that the new site is separate from Kickstarter and will \u201cnot be a subsidiary in any way, wholly its own thing [with] its own leadership.\u201dIt\u2019s too early to say if Baio and McMillan plan to weave the new platform into XOXO Fest, but the two projects are \u201creally closely aligned in mission,\u201d Baio said. Some of Drip\u2019s existing creators are XOXO Fest regulars and the event itself grew out of a successful Kickstarter that raised $175,511 back in 2012.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019re all used to seeing at this point how the platforms that we use have failed,\u201d Baio said. \u201cThe challenges that independent artists face are so profound already \u2014 to then have the tools and the platforms that you\u2019re using work against you has been a painful thing.\u201d That pain was a central theme at XOXO Fest this year, which I attended. (Full disclosure: I was also an early member of the XOXO Outpost, a year-round creative space that grew out of the festival.) Across genres, writers, musicians and developers alike expressed concerns that unaddressed harassment, racism and misogyny had turned once well-loved social platforms against some of the users who need them most.\u201cWe really hope that we can show people that this platform reflects the values and care we have for the artists that we care about,\u201d Baio said. \u201cWe want it to be sustainable and independent for a long time.\u201d"}
