{"id": "Microsoft to shut down HockeyApp", "paragraph": "Microsoft  announced plans to shut down HockeyApp and replace it with Visual Studio App Center. The company acquired the startup behind HockeyApp back in 2014. And if you\u2019re still using HockeyApp, the service will officially shut down on November 16, 2019.HockeyApp was a service that let you distribute beta versions of your app, get crash reports and analytics. There are other similar SDKs, such as Google\u2019s Crashlytics, TestFairy, Appaloosa, DeployGate and native beta distribution channels (Apple\u2019s TestFlight and Google Play Store\u2019s beta feature).Microsoft hasn\u2019t really been hiding its plans to shut down the service. Last year, the company called App Center \u201cthe future of HockeyApp\u201d. The company has also been cloning your HockeyApp projects into App Center for a while.It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll find the same features in App Center just yet. The company has put up a page with a feature roadmap. Let\u2019s hope that Microsoft has enough time to release everything before HockeyApp shuts down."}
