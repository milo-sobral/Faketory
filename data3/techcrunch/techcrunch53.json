{"id": "Google Pixel 3 XL users are getting twice the notch, thanks to a bug", "paragraph": "Over the past two years, the notch moved from anomaly to fact of life, and no company has proven itself more pro-notch than Google. From its embrace of #notchlife in Android Pie to the downright gigantic one found up top on the Pixel 3 XL, Google\u2019s really notchin\u2019 it up. In fact, as noted by Android Police, the Pixel 3 XL has a notch so nice, Google\u2019s delivering it twice. A number of owners have reported an admittedly hilarious bug that\u2019s causing the massive handset to double up on the notch, with a second cutout appearing on the side of the device.So my Pixel randomly grew another notch today. \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/c6Pff9MVmW pic.twitter.com/ugjfLmCkDZ\u2014 UrAvgConsumer (@UrAvgConsumer) October 24, 2018Google has acknowledged (acknotchleged?) the issue and noted that it\u2019s working on a fix, which should be coming soon. The company hasn\u2019t offered a reason behind the issue, but it appears to stem from Pie\u2019s built-in notch feature, and likely has something to do with how the background adjusts when the handset changes from portrait to landscape mode. It seems even in 2018, that\u2019s a notch too far. "}
