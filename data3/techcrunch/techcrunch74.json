{"id": "The iPhone is reportedly getting 5G in 2020", "paragraph": "The first 5G phones are set to start arriving next year. Motorola plans to bring next-gen connectivity via a Mod for the Z3, and companies like LG and OnePlus have promised to deliver the tech baked into handsets at some point in 2019. iPhone users, on the other hand, may have to wait a bit longer. The technology is, of course, an inevitability for Apple (along with everyone else, really), so it\u2019s just a question of when. A new report from Fast Company (via the Verge) puts the timing around a year and half out. The \u201csource with knowledge of Apple\u2019s plans\u201d put the 5G iPhone\u2019s arrival at some point in 2020, with Intel supplying the tech this time out. Apparently Apple and Intel are going through a bit of a rough patch of late, courtesy of heat/battery issues with the 8060 5G modem. Of course, things aren\u2019t rough enough for the company to hit up Qualcomm again.Given the on-going battle between the two companies, that\u2019s probably a bridge too far. Instead, Apple\u2019s holding out for Intel\u2019s 8161 chip. 5G presents a solid opportunity for Intel to regain some of the substantial ground it ceded to Qualcomm in the mobile market the last time out.
