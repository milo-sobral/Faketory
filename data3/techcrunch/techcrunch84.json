Facebook followed suit, announcing the next day that it would allow its employees to pursue claims of sexual harassment in court.Today, Airbnb and eBay  confirmed to TechCrunch they too would no longer require sexual harassment claims to be settled through private arbitration. Their announcements follow a BuzzFeed News article exploring which tech companies were updating their policies in light of the Google protest.Thousands of Google employees protested the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment & misconduct allegations on Nov. 1.\u201cWe are a company who believes that in the 21st Century it is important to continually consider and reconsider the best ways to support our employees and strengthen our workplace,\u201d a spokesperson for Airbnb said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have sought to build a culture of integrity and respect, and today\u2019s changes are just one more step to drive belonging and integrity in our workplace.\u201dHere\u2019s what eBay  had to say about its decision: \u201ceBay takes great pride in fostering an inclusive culture that allows employees to feel comfortable and encouraged to report any workplace issues. We\u2019ve adjusted our existing employee policy regarding sexual harassment claims to better reflect and encourage eBay\u2019s values of being open, honest and direct.\u201dAccording to BuzzFeed, Pinterest, Oath, Twitter, Reddit\u00a0and others have\u00a0never required mandatory arbitration. Uber, Lyft and Microsoft each put an end to forced arbitration in the last year.Arbitration is a private method of solving a dispute without a judge, jury or right to an appeal. Companies that require forced arbitration waive their employees\u2019 rights to sue and to participate in a class-action lawsuit.Google walkout organizers aren\u2019t satisfied with CEO\u2019s responseThrowing out its policy of forced arbitration was one of the five demands disgruntled employees had for Google.\u00a0In a\u00a0Medium post last week, the walkout organizers commended Google\u2019s decision to end forced arbitration while emphasizing the company\u2019s failure to address all\u00a0of their demands.\u2026\u201dThe response ignored several of the core demands\u200a\u2014\u200alike elevating the diversity officer and employee representation on the board\u200a\u2014\u200aand troublingly erased those focused on racism, discrimination, and the structural inequity built into the modern day Jim Crow class system that separates \u2018full time\u2019 employees from contract workers. Contract workers make up\u00a0more than half of Google\u2019s workforce, and perform essential roles across the company, but receive few of the benefits associated with tech company employment. They are also largely people of color, immigrants, and people from working class backgrounds.\u201dGoogle employees began crafting a plan for a company-wide walkout in late October, days after a bombshell New York Times investigation revealed\u00a0Google had given Android co-creator Andy Rubin a $90 million exit package despite multiple relationships with other\u00a0Google\u00a0\u00a0staffers and accusations of sexual misconduct.Rubin, for his part, has said\u00a0that the NYT\u2019s story contained\u00a0\u201cnumerous inaccuracies.\u201dGoogle walkout organizer: \u2018I hope I still have a career in Silicon Valley after this\u2019"}
