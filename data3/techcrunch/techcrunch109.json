The titles include a mix of classics like \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d as well as other family fare like \u201cZookeeper,\u201d \u201cAgent Cody Banks,\u201d and \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d among others.Before, YouTube had only offered consumers the ability to purchase movies and TV shows, similar to how you can rent or buy content from Apple\u2019s iTunes or Amazon Video.Currently, YouTube is serving ads on these free movies, but the report said the company is open to working out other deals with advertisers \u2013 like sponsorships or exclusive screenings.YouTube\u2019s advantage in this space, compared with some others, is its sizable user base of 1.9 billion monthly active users and its ability to target ads using data from Google .The addition of a an ad-supported movies marketplace on YouTube follows Roku\u2019s entry into this market, which began last year with the launch of its free collection of movies, called The Roku Channel.This year, Roku has been expanding the type of content on that channel to also include things like live news from\u00a0ABC News, Cheddar, Newsmax, Newsy, People TV, Yahoo and The Young Turks, and \u2013 more recently \u2013 entertainment and live sports.\u00a0Walmart also offers its own free movies collection through Vudu, and recently teamed up with MGM on original content for the service. Tubi operates a streaming service with free, ad-supported content, too. And Amazon is rumored to be working on something similar.\u00a0\u00a0"}
