{"id": "Facebook confirms it\u2019s building augmented reality glasses", "paragraph": "\u201cYeah! Well of course we\u2019re working on it,\u201d Facebook\u2019s  head of augmented reality Ficus Kirkpatrick told me when I asked him at TechCrunch\u2019s AR/VR event in LA if Facebook was building AR glasses. \u201cWe are building hardware products. We\u2019re going forward on this . . . We want to see those glasses come into reality, and I think we want to play our part in helping to bring them there.\u201dThis is the clearest confirmation we\u2019ve received yet from Facebook about its plans for AR glasses. The product could be Facebook\u2019s opportunity to own a mainstream computing device on which its software could run after a decade of being beholden to smartphones built, controlled and taxed by Apple and Google.Fresh off the heels of its first hardware launch, Facebook's Fiscus Kirkpatrick says the company is also working on an AR headset https://t.co/AS8IMIO56b #TCARVR pic.twitter.com/eWW6JX22yc\u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) October 24, 2018This month, Facebook launched its first self-branded gadget out of its Building 8 lab, the Portal smart display, and now it\u2019s revving up hardware efforts. For AR, Kirkpatrick told me, \u201cWe have no product to announce right now. But we have a lot of very talented people doing really, really compelling cutting-edge research that we hope plays a part in the future of headsets.\u201dThere\u2019s a war brewing here. AR startups like Magic Leap and Thalmic Labs are starting to release their first headsets and glasses. Microsoft is considered a leader thanks to its early HoloLens product, while Google Glass is still being developed for the enterprise. And Apple has acquired AR hardware developers like Akonia Holographics\u00a0and Vrvana\u00a0to accelerate development of its own headsets.Mark Zuckerberg said at F8 2017 that AR glasses were 5 to 7 years awayTechnological progress and competition seems to have sped up Facebook\u2019s timetable. Back in April 2017, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \u201cWe all know where we want this to get eventually, we want glasses,\u201d but explained that \u201cwe do not have the science or technology today to build the AR glasses that we want. We may in five years, or seven years.\u201d He explained that \u201cWe can\u2019t build the AR product that we want today, so building VR is the path to getting to those AR glasses.\u201d The company\u2019s Oculus  division had talked extensively about the potential of AR glasses, yet similarly characterized them as far off.But a few months later, a Facebook patent application for AR glasses was spotted by Business Insider that detailed using \u201cwaveguide display with two-dimensional scanner\u201d to project media onto the lenses. Cheddar\u2019s Alex Heath reports that Facebook is working on Project Sequoia that uses projectors to display AR experiences on top of physical objects like a chess board on a table or a person\u2019s likeness on something for teleconferencing. These indicate Facebook was moving past AR research.Facebook AR glasses patent applicationLast month, The Information spotted four Facebook job listings seeking\u00a0engineers with experience building custom AR computer chips to join the Facebook Reality Lab (formerly known as Oculus research).\u00a0And a week later, Oculus\u2019 Chief Scientist Michael Abrash briefly mentioned amidst a half-hour technical keynote at the company\u2019s VR conference that \u201cNo off the shelf display technology is good enough for AR, so we had no choice but to develop a new display system. And that system also has the potential to bring VR to a different level.\u201dBut Kirkpatrick clarified that he sees Facebook\u2019s AR efforts not just as a mixed reality feature of VR headsets. \u201cI don\u2019t think we converge to one single device . . . I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to end up in a Ready Player One future where everyone is just hanging out in VR all the time,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI think we\u2019re still going to have the lives that we have today where you stay at home and you have maybe an escapist, immersive experience or you use VR to transport yourself somewhere else. But I think those things like the people you connect with, the things you\u2019re doing, the state of your apps and everything needs to be carried and portable on-the-go with you as well, and I think that\u2019s going to look more like how we think about AR.\u201dOculus Chief Scientist Michael Abrash makes predictions about the future of AR and VR at the Oculus Connect 5 conferenceOculus virtual reality headsets and Facebook augmented reality glasses could share an underlying software layer, though, which might speed up engineering efforts while making the interface more familiar for users. \u201cI think that all this stuff will converge in some way maybe at the software level,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.The problem for Facebook AR is that it may run into the same privacy concerns that people had about putting a Portal camera inside their homes. While VR headsets generate a fictional world, AR must collect data about your real-world surroundings. That could raise fears about Facebook surveilling not just our homes but everything we do, and using that data to power ad targeting and content recommendations. This brand tax haunts Facebook\u2019s every move.Startups with a cleaner slate like Magic Leap and giants with a better track record on privacy like Apple could have an easier time getting users to put a camera on their heads. Facebook would likely need a best-in-class gadget that does much that others can\u2019t in order to convince people it deserves to augment their reality.You can watch our full interview with Facebook\u2019s director of camera and head of augmented reality engineering Ficus Kirkpatrick from our TechCrunch Sessions: AR/VR event in LA:"}
