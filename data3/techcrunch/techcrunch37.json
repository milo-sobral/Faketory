{"id": "China tariffs are taking a toll on robot vacuums", "paragraph": "We already knew the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China was set to have an impact on consumer electronics like Fitbit trackers and the Apple Watch. It seems that tariffs are also starting to take their toll on the world of robotic vacuums \u2014 namely iRobot. As CNBC notes, the company\u2019s shares took a hit today, in spite of positive earnings. That comes as iRobot noted that it\u2019s working to address rising costs in the face of Trump administration-imposed tariffs. The company says it\u2019s thus far avoiding raising the price on products by simply absorbing the higher export fees. But that could well change in the future, as it continues to reassess how it will deal with such costs, going forward. \u201cA lot of those scenarios do assume some level of potentially passing some of the pricing on to the consumers, but we haven\u2019t exactly settled on the final answer yet,\u201d CEO Colin Angle said on a call following iRobot\u2019s quarterly report. \u201cOur expectations that we set in February would not assume that we carry the full burden of the tariff increases.\u201dIncreasing the cost of Roomba could certainly impact sales, moving forward. The product has been a tremendous success for the company, becoming one of the world\u2019s best selling vacuums. But iRobot is routinely knocked for pricing \u2014 its latest \u2018bot, the i7+, runs $950, putting it at around the same cost as a high-end flagship smartphone. All the while, an influx of cheap competitors have undercut it on the low-end. We\u2019ve reached out to iRobot for comment. "}
