{"id": "Mobvoi launches new $200 smartwatch and $130 AirPods alternative", "paragraph": "Chinese AI company Mobvoi  has consistently been one of the best also-rans in the smartwatch game, which remains dominated by Apple. Today, it\u00a0launched a sequel to its 2016 TicWatch, which was a viral hit raising over $2 million on Kickstarter, and it unveiled a cheaper take on\u00a0Apple\u2019s AirPods.The new\u00a0TicWatch C2 was outed at a London event and is priced at $199.99. Unlike its predecessor, it has shifted from Mobvoi\u2019s own OS to Google\u2019s  Wear OS. That isn\u2019t a huge surprise, though, since Mobvoi\u2019s\u00a0newer\u00a0budget watches\u00a0and \u2018pro\u2019 watch have both already made that jump.The C2 \u2014 which stands for classic 2 \u2014 packs NFC, Bluetooth, NFC and\u00a0a voice assistant. It comes in black, platinum and rose gold. The latter color option \u2014\u00a0shown below \u2014 is thinner so presumably it is designed for female wrists.However, there\u2019s a compromise since the watch isn\u2019t shipping with Qualcomm\u2019s  newest\u00a0Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip. Mobvoi has instead picked the older 2100 processor. That might explain the price, but it will\u00a0mean that newer Android  Wear watches shipping in the company months have better performance, particularly around battery life. As it stands, the\u00a0TicWatch C2 claims a day-two life but the processor should be a consideration for would-be buyers.Mobvoi also outed\u00a0TicPods Free, its take on Apple\u2019s  wireless AirPods. They are priced at $129.99 and available in red, white and blue.The earbuds already\u00a0raised over $2.8 million from Indiegogo\u00a0\u2014 Mobvoi typically uses crowdfunding to gather feedback and assess customer interest \u2014 and early reviews have been positive.They work on Android and iOS and include support for Alex and Google Assistant. They also include gesture-based controls beyond the Apple-style taps for skipping music, etc. Battery life without the case, which doubles as a charger, is estimated at 18 hours, or four hours of listening time.The TicPods are available to buy online now.\u00a0The TicWatch C2 is up for pre-sale ahead of a \u201cwide\u201d launch that\u2019s planned for December 6.Mobvoi specializes in AI and it includes Google among its investors. It also has a joint venture with VW that is focused on bringing Ai into the automotive industry. In China it is best known for AI services but globally, in the consumer space, it also offers a Google Assistant speaker called TicHome Mini."}
