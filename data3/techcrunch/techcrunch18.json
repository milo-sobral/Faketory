{"id": "Facebook launches \u2018Hunt for False News\u2019 debunk blog as fakery drops 50%", "paragraph": "Facebook  hopes detailing concrete examples of fake news it\u2019s caught \u2014 or missed \u2014 could improve news literacy, or at least prove it\u2019s attacking the misinformation problem. Today Facebook launched \u201cThe Hunt for False News,\u201d in which it examines viral B.S., relays the decisions of its third-party fact-checkers and explains how the story was tracked down. The first edition reveals cases where false captions were put on old videos, people were wrongfully identified as perpetrators of crimes or real facts were massively exaggerated.The blog\u2019s launch comes after three recent studies showed the volume of misinformation on Facebook has dropped by half since the 2016 election, while Twitter\u2019s volume hasn\u2019t declined as drastically. Unfortunately, the remaining 50 percent still threatens elections, civil discourse, dissident safety and political unity across the globe.In one of The Hunt\u2019s first examples, it debunks that a man who posed for a photo with one of Brazil\u2019s senators had stabbed the presidential candidate. Facebook explains that its machine learning models identified the photo, it was proven false by Brazilian fact-checker\u00a0Aos Fatos, and Facebook now automatically detects and demotes uploads of the image. In a case where it missed the mark, a false story touting NASA would pay you $100,000 to study you staying in bed for 60 days \u201cracked up millions of views on Facebook\u201d before fact-checkers found NASA had paid out $10,000 to $17,000 in limited instances for studies in the past.While the educational \u201cHunt\u201d series is useful, it merely cherry-picks random false news stories from over a wide time period. What\u2019s more urgent, and would be more useful, would be for Facebook to apply this method to currently circulating misinformation about the most important news stories. The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose recently began using Facebook\u2019s CrowdTangle tool to highlight the top 10 recent stories by engagement about topics like the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.Top performing Kavanaugh-related posts on Facebook over the last 24 hours (per @crowdtangle) come from:1. Trump2. Fox News3. Franklin Graham4. Fox News5. CNN6. NRA Institute for Legislative Action7. GOP8. Ben Shapiro9. The Sage Page10. FreedomWorks11. NRA12. Breitbart\u2014 Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) October 7, 2018If Facebook wanted to be more transparent about its successes and failures around fake news, it\u2019d publish lists of the false stories with the highest circulation each month and then apply the Hunt\u2019s format explaining how they were debunked. This could help dispel myths in society\u2019s understanding that may be propagated by the mere abundance of fake news headlines, even if users don\u2019t click through to read them.The red line represents the decline of Facebook engagement with \u201cunreliable or dubious\u201d sitesBut at least all of Facebook\u2019s efforts around information security \u2014 including doubling its security staff from 10,000 to 20,000 workers, fact checks and using News Feed algorithm changes to demote suspicious content \u2014 are paying off:Of course, given Twitter\u2019s  seeming paralysis on addressing misinformation and trolling, they\u2019re not a great benchmark for Facebook to judge by. While it\u2019s useful that Facebook is outlining ways to spot fake news, the public will have to internalize these strategies for society to make progress. That may be difficult when the truth has become incompatible with many peoples\u2019 and politicians\u2019 staunchly held beliefs.In the past, Facebook has surfaced fake news-spotting tips atop the News Feed and bought full-page newspaper ads trying to disseminate them. The Hunt for Fake News would surely benefit from being embedded where the social network\u2019s users look everyday instead of buried in its corporate blog."}
