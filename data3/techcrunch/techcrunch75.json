{"id": "A long and winding road to new copyright legislation", "paragraph": "Back in May, as part of a settlement, Spotify  agreed to pay more than\u00a0$112 million\u00a0to clean up some copyright problems. Even for a service with millions of users, that had to leave a mark. No one wants to be dragged into court all the time, not even bold, disruptive technology start-ups.On October 11th, the President signed the Hatch-Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (the \u201cAct\u201d, or \u201cMMA\u201d). The MMA goes back, legislatively, to at least 2013, when Chairman Goodlatte (R-VA) announced that, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, he planned to conduct\u00a0a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d review\u00a0of issues in US copyright law. Ranking Member Jerry Nadler (D-NY) was also deeply involved in this process, as were Senators Hatch (R-UT) Leahy (D-VT), and Wyden (D-OR). But this legislation didn\u2019t fall from the sky; far from it.After many hearings, several \u201croadshow\u201d panels around the country, and a couple of elections, in early 2018 Goodlatte announced his intent to move forward on addressing\u00a0several looming issues in music copyright\u00a0before his planned retirement from Congress at the end of his current term (January 2019).\u00a0 With that deadline in place, the push was on, and through the spring and summer, the House Judiciary Committee and their colleagues in the Senate worked to complete the text of the legislation and move it through to process. By late September, the House and Senate versions had been reconciled and the bill moved to the President\u2019s desk.What\u2019s all this about streaming?As enacted, the Act instantiates several changes to music copyright in the US, especially as regards\u00a0streaming\u00a0music services. What does \u201cstreaming\u201d refer to in this context? Basically, it occurs when a provider makes music available to listeners, over the internet, without creating a downloadable or storable copy: \u201cStreaming differs from downloads in that no copy of the music is saved to your hard drive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins.\u201dOne part, by far the largest change in terms of money, provides that a\u00a0new royalty regime\u00a0be created for digital streaming of musical works, e.g. by services like Spotify and Apple Music. Pre-1972 recordings \u2014 and the creators involved in making them (including, for the first time, for audio engineers, studio mixers and record producers) \u2014 are also brought under this royalty umbrella.These are significant, generally beneficial results for a piece of legislation. But to make this revenue bounty fully effective, a to-be-created licensing entity will have to be set up with the ability to first collect, and then distribute, the money. Think \u201cASCAP/BMI for streaming.\u201d This new non-profit will be the first such \u201ccollective licensing\u201d copyright organization set up in the US in quite some time.Collective Licensing: It\u2019s not \u201cMoney for Nothing\u201d, right?What do we mean by \u201ccollective licensing\u201d in this context, and how will this new organization be created and organized to engage in it? Collective licensing is primarily an economically efficient mechanism for (A) gathering up monies due for certain uses of works under copyright\u2013 in this case, digital streaming of musical recordings, and (B) distributing the royalty checks back to the rights-holding parties ( e.g. recording artists, their estates in some cases, and record labels).\u00a0 Generally speaking, in collective licensing:\u00a0\u201c\u2026rights holders collect money that would otherwise be in tiny little bits that they could not afford to collect, and in that way they are able to protect their copyright rights. On the flip side, substantial users of lots of other people\u2019s copyrighted materials are prepared to pay for it, as long as the transaction costs are not extreme.\u201d\u2014Fred Haber, VP and Corporate Counsel, Copyright Clearance CenterThe Act envisions the new organization as setting up and implementing a new, extensive \u2014and, publicly accessible \u2014database of musical works and the rights attached to them. Nothing quite like this is currently available, although resources like SONY\u2019s\u00a0Gracenote\u00a0suggest a good start along those lines. After it is set up and the initial database has a sufficient number of records, the new collective licensing agency will then get down to the business of offering licenses:\u201c\u2026a blanket statutory license administered by a nonprofit mechanical licensing collective. This\u00a0collective will collect and distribute royalties, work to identify songs and their owners for payment, and maintain a comprehensive, publicly accessible database for music ownership information.\u201d\u2014 Regan A.

(AP Photo)You \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d, so who is all this going to benefit?In theory, the listening public should be the primary beneficiary. More music available through digital streaming services means more exposure \u2014and potentially more money \u2014for recording artists. For students of music, the new database of recorded works and licenses will serve to clarify who is (or was) responsible for what. Another public benefit will be fewer actions on digital streaming issues clogging up the courts.There\u2019s an interesting wrinkle in the Act providing for the otherwise authorized use of \u201corphaned\u201d musical works such that these can now be played in library or archival (i.e. non-profit) contexts. \u201cOrphan works\u201d are those which may still protected under copyright, but for which the legitimate rights holders are unknown, and, sometimes, undiscoverable. This is the first implementation of\u00a0orphan works\u00a0authorization in US copyright law.\u00a0 Cultural services \u2013 like\u00a0Open Culture\u00a0\u2013 can look forward to being able to stream more musical works without incurring risk or hindrance (provided that the proper forms are filled out) and this implies that some great music is now more likely to find new audiences and thereby be preserved for posterity. Even the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), generally no great fan of new copyright legislation,\u00a0finds something to like\u00a0in the Act.\nIn the land of copyright wonks, and in\u00a0another line of infringement suits, this resolution of the copyright status of musical recordings released before 1972 seems, in my opinion, fair and workable. In order to accomplish that, the Act also had to address the matter of the duration of these new copyright protections, which is always (post-1998) a touchy subject:(Source:\u00a0US Copyright Office)\u00a0(Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images for Live Nation)Money (That\u2019s What I Want \u2013 and lots and lots of listeners, too.)For the digital music services themselves, this statutory or \u2018blanket\u2019 license arrangement should mean fewer infringement actions being brought; this might\u00a0even help their prospects for investment\u00a0and\u00a0encourage\u00a0 new and more innovative services to come into the mix.\u201cAnd, in The End\u2026\u201dThis new legislation, now the law of the land, extends the history of American copyright law in new and substantial ways. Its actual implementation is only now beginning. Although five years might seem like a lifetime in popular culture, in politics it amounts to several eons. And let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that the industry got over its perceived short-term self-interests enough, this time, to agree to support something that Congress could pass. That\u2019s rare enough to take note of and applaud.This law lacks perfection, as all laws do. The licensing regime it envisions will not satisfy everyone, but every constituent, every stakeholder, got something. From the perspective of right now, chances seem good that, a few years from now, the achievement of the Hatch-Goodlatte Music Modernization Act will be viewed as a net positive for creators of music, for the distributors of music, for scholars, fans of \u2018open culture\u2019, and for the listening public. In copyright, you can\u2019t do better than that."}
