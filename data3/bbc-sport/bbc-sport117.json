We probably had to play our best game of this term and thankfully we managed to do that.\"It's a big piece of history and one that we wanted to tick off here in Ireland and now we have done it.\"Ireland captain Rory Best: \"To stop New Zealand scoring a try shows what a fantastic effort it was. The boys are very tired in there but it's amazing what a win like that can do to give you a little bit more energy.\"It's a big result for us no matter what the context is. Yet again, we've raised the standard of what we expect. The problem is Joe and the team and going to expect that and more [from now on].\"Ireland: Kearney; Earls, Ringrose, Aki, Stockdale; Sexton, Marmion; Healy, Best (capt), Furlong; Toner, James Ryan; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Stander.Replacements: Cronin for Best (65), J McGrath for Healy (52), Porter for Furlong (65), Henderson for Toner (62), Murphy for O'Mahony (64), L McGrath for Marmion (59), Carbery for Sexton (77), Larmour for Kearney (66).New Zealand: McKenzie; Smith, Goodhue, Crotty, Ioane; Barrett, Smith; Tu'inukuafe, Taylor, Franks; Whitelock, Retallick: Squire, Savea, Read (capt).Replacements: Coles for Taylor (47), Tuungafasi for Tu'inukuafe (47), Laulala for Franks (47), S Barrett for Squire (32), Todd for Savea (74), Perenara for Smith (58), Mo'unga for McKenzie (56), Lienert-Brown for Crotty (62).Referee: Wayne Barnes (England)Share this withNorthern Ireland have the better chances but have to settle for a 0-0 draw in the friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.Paul McGinley says he is baffled by Rory McIlroy's intention to play just two European Tour events in 2019.Josh Warrington and Carl Frampton feel a pay-per-view clash between two shows is \"unfair\" on fans and \"not good for boxing\".Find ways to get activeHow to get involved in just about any sport or activityFind a club, activity or sport near you"}
