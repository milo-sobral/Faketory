My wife R. Jai and I could not be prouder of the way we ran this race. We could not be more thankful to my running mate, @ChrisKingFL and his wife Kristen.End of Twitter post  by @AndrewGillumMr DeSantis - a staunch supporter of US President Donald Trump and his policies - replied to the tweets, saying it was now \"time to bring Florida together\".The recount has been controversial. Mr Trump and Republicans have claimed voter fraud without offering any evidence.Mr Trump had also said there was \"a lot of dishonesty\" over contested votes. Again, he offered no evidence.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab criticises the \"lack of will and resolve\" in dealing with the EU.What are the differences between the two?"}
