Changes to the 118-year-old team event will see the competition turned into a week-long competition taking place in November, with 18 nations battling for the title. The first two editions will take place in Madrid\u2019s La Caja Magica, the current venue for the Madrid Open. Men\u2019s Tour the ATP have also announced the start of a rival World Team Cup to begin in Australia in January 2020 with the likes of world number one Novak Djokovic and 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer likely to prioritize it. The 21-year-old Zverev, regarded as one of the players to lead men\u2019s tennis into a new era, said he would still be available for the Davis Cup qualifying round in February but said he would not play in the November finals week, suggesting the date was a bad choice for most players. Germany host Hungary in February in Frankfurt and must win to qualify for the Madrid finals. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play Davis Cup in November,\u201d world number five Zverev told reporters after his win over Marin Cilic at the ATP Finals on Monday. \u201cI am going to play in February in Germany, in Frankfurt, I\u2019m going to do that. \u201cThe Davis Cup has some serious issues to think about. One of them is the dates. I think the date is very important and I think none of the top players will play, except Rafa (Nadal) because it\u2019s in Spain. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sure that a lot of top players will not play. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d American John Isner, beaten by Novak Djokovic on his ATP Finals debut, said he supported the idea of revamping the Davis Cup but said organizers needed to think again about staging the finals at the end of a grueling season. \u201cThe format\u2019s unique. I, for one, don\u2019t like the date. I think that\u2019s the big beef with players now,\u201d the 33-year-old told reporters. \u201cLet\u2019s say the top 20 players that end their season in Paris (Masters at the end of October or early November), and then go home, usually that\u2019s the end of the season. And to try to gear up for Davis Cup after this event, it would be pretty tough, mentally and physically. The date\u2019s not ideal.\u201d Zverev was more positive about the ATP\u2019s World Team Cup. \u201cHopefully, it\u2019s going to be a good event,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s in the first week of the year, so it makes sense to play, and it\u2019s in Australia as well. \u201cSo it\u2019s not bad schedule-wise.\u201d The International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced in August that its proposals to breathe new life into the Davis Cup had been backed by the majority of national federations. Investment group Kosmos, led by Spanish international footballer Gerard Pique, has signed a 25-year partnering deal with the ITF to revamp the Davis Cup with a total investment of $3 billion being plowed into tennis.
