The migrants pose a tough challenge to the Mexican government\u2019s pledge to stop the illegal travellers\u2019 plans to press ahead to the U.S. border. More than 5,100 migrants have been registered in three shelters in the Mexican border town of Ciudad Hidalgo, while another 2,000 had camped out for the night in the town\u2019s central square, said Gerardo Hernandez, head of the local government\u2019s emergency services. \u201cIt\u2019s really full. You can\u2019t even walk, there\u2019s just so many people,\u201d he said referring to the plaza. \u201cSo far, they\u2019re all peaceful, thank God.\u201d In a statement on Saturday night, Mexico\u2019s federal government said \u201cnearly 900 migrants\u201d had arrived by unauthorised means, while 640 had been processed after being allowed to cross into the country via the international border crossing on the Suchite River that divides Guatemala from Mexico. Earlier in the day, the presidents of Honduras and Guatemala said about 2,500 migrants had either already been repatriated to Honduras or were in transit back home, many using free bus tickets doled out by Guatemalan police. Throngs of people continued to wait on the bridge border crossing, where on Saturday morning many pressed for limited opportunities to plead their case to immigration officials, while many others opted to cross the river illegally, either on  jury-rigged rafts or by swimming. The migrant rights group Pueblos Sin Fronteras also counted thousands of mostly Honduran migrants nearby Cuidad Hidalgo, although the figures did not exactly match. Some 2,000 Honduran migrants were already back home after giving up on continuing to Mexico, Guatemala\u2019s President Jimmy Morales said at midday press conference in Guatemala City alongside his Honduran counterpart, President Juan Orlando Hernandez. Hernandez said about 500 migrants were in transit back to Honduras, a roughly 12-hour trip by road. \u201cWe are working to provide a peaceful and safe return trip and avoid that these movements keep happening in the future,\u201d said Morales.  The leaders of all three countries have come under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who for days has warned that the caravan must be stopped. Trump has made it a political issue in the Nov. 6 mid-term U.S. congressional election, threatened to cut off regional aid, close the U.S.-Mexico border and deploy troops there if Mexico failed to halt the migrants. Hernandez noted that migrants from elsewhere in the region had joined the caravan, along with others from \u201coutside the region,\u201d though he did not cite specific nationalities. He added that planes would be used to fly children back home. The migrants seemed confused over their next moves while it was equally unclear how Mexican authorities would react to so many unauthorised arrivals. \u201cThis is not a caravan anymore. This is an exodus,\u201d said Ruben Figuerora of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, standing on the muddy bank of the Mexican side of the Suchite river, as a line of young male migrants walked past him after crossing on a raft. Most of the migrants spoken to by Reuters said their ultimate goal was to reach the United States. Some said they hoped to stay in Mexico, but that they had no idea how to get the documents needed to do so. Others decided they needed more time to determine what comes next.  \u201cFor now we\u2019ll wait,\u201d said Honduran migrant Alexander Alvarado. Most of the people now caught trying to enter the United States illegally hail from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala,  among the poorest and most violent countries in the Americas. The caravan members ranged from farmers and bakers to housewives and students. Osman Melgar, who nursed a bleeding gash on his shin, suffered when he fell as dozens of people packed on the bridge began fleeing Mexican police using tear gas, according to several eyewitnesses. Many, including 40-year-old Adriana Consuelo, paid raftsmen 25 pesos ($1.30) to ferry them across the river on vessels constructed of giant rubber tires with wooden planks tethered across them. After making it across the river to Mexico, Conseulo headed to a taco restaurant to eat saying, \u201cNo one checked my documents.\u201d  Reporting by Delphine Schrank; Additional reporting by Sofia Menchu in Guatemala City and David Alire Garcia in Mexico City; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Tom Brown and Daniel WallisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
