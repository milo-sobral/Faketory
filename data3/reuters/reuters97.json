{"id": "Djokovic backs Federer in preferential treatment row", "paragraph": "3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - World number one Novak Djokovic leapt to the defense of great rival Roger Federer on Monday after claims that the Swiss enjoys preferential treatment on Tour. Frenchman Julien Benneteau caused a stir during an interview on French radio station RMC Sport on Sunday in which he said tournament referees were often kinder to Federer when it came to scheduling his matches. Benneteau was particularly referring to the Australian Open where he said 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer played \u201c12 or 13\u201d of his 14 matches at Melbourne in the past two years at night, so avoiding the often scorching temperatures. He also suggested Federer\u2019s Laver Cup project, an exhibition team event in which Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley is also involved, represented a conflict of interest. Asked for his thoughts after his round-robin victory over American John Isner at the ATP Finals on Monday, Djokovic said Federer had earned the right for special treatment. \u201cIn the end of the day, in a way he deserves the special treatment because he\u2019s six-time champion of Australian Open and arguably the best player ever,\u201d Djokovic told reporters. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have it, who is going to have it? People want to see him play on the center court, and they want to see him play in showtime, the best hours, which is 7:30 at night in Rod Laver Arena. \u201cI understand Julien\u2019s point because sometimes it does seem that maybe certain players get more favored year after year in certain tournaments. On the other side, you have to understand that Federer is a driving force of tennis in terms of revenue, in terms of attention. \u201cJulien and guys like him are also benefiting from tennis, because of Roger, because of what he has done for the sport.\u201d Isner went even further, saying the likes of Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal should get even more privileges. \u201cIf anything, maybe they should get more special treatment because those guys, the top players, have made other players below them a lot of money,\u201d the American said after his 6-4 6-3 defeat. \u201cIt is like the Tiger Woods effect in golf. So that is how you can look at a guy like Roger. He is men\u2019s tennis in my opinion. He deserves everything and more that he\u2019s ever had.\u201d Six-time champion Federer is back in action, in the night session, at the ATP Finals on Tuesday when he takes on Dominic Thiem, aiming to hit back after losing to Kei Nishikori in his opening group match on Sunday.
