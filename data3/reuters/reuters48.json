The study was part of Schummers\u2019 dissertation at the Harvard School of Public Health.  When Schummers and her colleagues started the study, they thought they might find lower risks in the older women. That\u2019s because most of these short interval pregnancies in older women are by choice: the women are at an age where their fertility is waning and they want a chance to have more than one child, Schummers said.  \u201cWomen who are 35 and older do quite often plan to have closely spaced pregnancies,\u201d Schummers said. \u201cAmong younger women, the pregnancy is less often planned if it\u2019s closely spaced. If someone has a baby and six months later they discover they are pregnant, perhaps that\u2019s not intended. We thought because older women more often plan to have their pregnancies closer together they might not have the increased risks that are due to unintended pregnancies.\u201d As it turned out, there were fewer complications among the babies carried by older women, compared to younger women. But there was still a slight increased risk when the spacing between pregnancies was short, the authors reported in JAMA Internal Medicine. But contrary to what the researchers had expected, short intervals between pregnancies - six versus 18 months - were linked with higher risks for death and serious complications (such as transfusions of three or more units of blood, being put on a ventilator, being transferred to an intensive care unit, or organ failure) for older women, but not younger women. To look more closely at the impact of interpregnancy intervals, Schummers and her colleagues turned to the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, a database which contains a summary of information gleaned from obstetrical and newborn medical records. In the end, the researchers were able to take a closer look at 148,544 pregnancies that occurred over a 10-year period. While the study is interesting, it\u2019s not clear how well it would apply to U.S. patients, said. Dr. Tarun Jain, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine and a fertility specialist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be aware that these findings might not be generalizable,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnother important point,\u201d Jain said, is that while shorter interval between pregnancies was associated with higher risks for older women, \u201cthe risk was still relatively low.\u201d  Jain, who was not affiliated with the new research, added, \u201cYou have to balance that against the fact that as you get older the probability of getting and staying pregnant decreases. If you wait too long it may be hard to get pregnant at all.\u201d Dr. Leena Nathan often finds herself discussing that balance with her older patients.  \u201cMany of my patients are older than 35 when they have their first child,\u201d said Nathan, an assistant clinical professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and medical director of UCLA Community OBGYN Practices. \u201cAnd many of them do have short interval spacing between pregnancies because they are worried about their fertility. It is certainly a discussion during the postpartum visit after the first delivery.\u201d Nathan doesn\u2019t expect the 40-somethings to put too much time between pregnancies. \u201cIn my moms who are older than 40, I counsel them about fertility rates and genetic mutations as they continue to age,\u201d said Nathan, who was not involved with the new research, said in an email. \u201cThese patients generally are very motivated and will take good care of themselves in order to have a healthy subsequent pregnancy even if it is less than an 18-month interval. I don\u2019t discourage a shorter interval pregnancy in these patients.\u201d SOURCE: bit.ly/2yJj11Y and bit.ly/2yGgMfS JAMA Internal Medicine, online October 29, 2018.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
