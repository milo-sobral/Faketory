{"id": "UK wants deal to avoid Northern Ireland Brexit backstop - minister", "paragraph": "2 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Brexit minister Dominic Raab wants the European Union to accept assurances that the country will remain tied to the bloc\u2019s rules for longer in return for making a hotly contested so-called backstop for Northern Ireland unnecessary. Talks between Britain and the European Union have stalled over a disagreement over the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions, if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. Raab writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said Britain\u2019s proposal to extend its Brexit transition period should be an \u201calternative\u201d to the insurance plan. \u201cThe Prime Minister has rightly refused to rule out considering different approaches \u2013 including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop,\u201d he said. But so far the European Union has said the backstop on the island of Ireland must remain in place to proceed with the divorce negotiations.
