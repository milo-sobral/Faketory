Going in search of their 12th victory in 13 matches this year, with their only blemish a 36-34 home loss to South Africa, the southern hemisphere champions came up short in most areas as Ireland ran out deserving winners. \u201cI said this at the beginning of the week, you\u2019ve the two best sides in the world playing each other, so as of now they\u2019re the number one team in the world. I guess they are favourites (for the World Cup),\u201d Hansen told a news conference. \u201cI thought they played outstandingly well, they deserved to win and they took the opportunities they got. We just got beaten by a better team.\u201d Given they had just recorded only their second ever victory against the winners of the last two World Cups and nearly every Rugby Championship in between, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt took his fellow countryman\u2019s prediction with a large pinch of salt. \u201cThe World Cup in 11 months\u2019 time?\u201d Schmidt said, opting instead to focus on his team\u2019s next match against the lowly United States in a week\u2019s time. \u201cI think he (Hansen) probably enjoys a bit of a banter. For us to be favourites when they\u2019ve been the world number one team for nine years and continue to be the world number one team. We\u2019ll take tonight and we\u2019ll leave 11 months for 11 months\u2019 time.\u201d Ahead of the final game of their season in Italy next week, Hansen was left to rue some poor discipline early on that cost his side nine penalties in the first half and handed the Six Nations champions the initiative that they refused to let go. \u201cOur discipline in the first half let us down a bit. Some of the penalties in the first half were just dumb, avoidable penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you start to have to chase the game, in what is a really very tight game, you start to force things a little bit when you don\u2019t have to. When you play a very good rugby side, it comes back and bites you.\u201d Additional reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Toby DavisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
