West, Trump\u2019s biggest celebrity supporter, also sought to distance himself from a new campaign that encourages black Americans to quit the Democratic Party. \u201cMy eyes are now wide open and now realize I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative!!!\u201d West tweeted, without mentioning Trump, who is a Republican, or any other names. The singer and fashion designer, who has said he is bipolar, also said he \u201cnever wanted any association\u201d with a campaign launched last weekend called Blexit that seeks to draw African-Americans away from their long-standing support for Democrats. West, 41, was linked to the campaign after its leader, conservative activist Candace Owens, said he had designed the logo for the movement\u2019s hats and T-shirts. \u201cI introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn\u2019t want their name on it so she used mine,\u201d West tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cI have nothing to do with it.\u201d West posted his comments just a week before U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6 and after months of erratic behavior, including describing slavery as a choice. On Oct. 11, he met Trump in the Oval Office and launched into a rambling 10-minute-long speech carried live on television in which he said Trump made him feel like a superhero, and referenced the existence of an alternate universe.
