The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, required elimination of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries. \u201cRussia has not, unfortunately, honored the agreement so we\u2019re going to terminate the agreement and we\u2019re going to pull out,\u201d Trump told reporters on Saturday after a rally in Nevada. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Sunday that a unilateral withdrawal by the United States would be \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and lead to a \u201cmilitary-technical\u201d retaliation.  Gorbachev, now a frail 87-year-old, said it would be a mistake for Washington to quit the treaty, and it would undermine work he and U.S. counterparts did to end the Cold War Arms race. \u201cDo they really not understand in Washington what this could lead to?\u201d Interfax news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying. A Kremlin spokesman said Russian President Vladimir Putin would seek answers about the planned withdrawal when he meets John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, for scheduled talks in Moscow this week. U.S. authorities believe Moscow is developing and has deployed a ground-launched system in breach of the INF treaty that could allow it to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice. Russia has consistently denied any such violation. Trump said the United States will develop the weapons unless Russia and China agree to a halt on development. China is not a party to the treaty. The arms control accord, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in a ceremony at the White House, bans land-based medium-range nuclear missiles capable of hitting Europe or Alaska. It ended a Cold War-era crisis, when the Soviet Union installed nearly 400 nuclear warheads pointed at western Europe. The United States had responded by stationing Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe.  But this provoked a wave of protests from anti-nuclear campaigners, who felt the deployment turned Europe into a potential nuclear battleground.  In the early 1980s, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in Bonn, West Germany, and campaigners formed a protest camp at Greenham Common, in Britain, the site of Cruise missiles. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov, in comments reported by state-controlled RIA news agency, said if the United States withdrew, Russia would have no choice but to retaliate, including taking unspecified measures of a \u201cmilitary-technical nature\u201d. \u201cBut we would rather things did not get that far,\u201d RIA quoted him as saying. TASS news agency quoted him as saying withdrawal \u201cwould be a very dangerous step\u201d, and it was Washington and not Moscow that was failing to comply with the treaty.  He said the Trump administration was using the treaty in an attempt to blackmail the Kremlin, putting global security at risk. \u201c... We will, of course, accept no ultimatums or blackmail methods,\u201d Interfax quoted him as saying. Asked about Trump\u2019s comments in Beijing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said a unilateral withdrawal would have a negative impact on many sides. She urged the United States to \u201cprudently\u201d handle the issue and to \u201cthink thrice before acting\u201d.  \u201cWhat needs to be stressed is that talking about China on the issue of unilaterally pulling out of the treaty is completely mistaken,\u201d she said. British defense minister Gavin Williamson, in comments reported by the Financial Times, said London stood \u201cresolute\u201d behind Washington over the issue, and that the Kremlin was making a mockery of the agreement. However, another NATO member, Germany, voiced misgivings. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that for 30 years the treaty had been a pillar of Europe\u2019s security architecture. \u201cWe now urge the United States to consider the possible consequences,\u201d of quitting the pact, Maas said on Sunday. Trump has in the past threatened to tear up international agreements but in the event has not carried through. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, drew a parallel with the NAFTA trade pact, which Trump threatened to tear up, before a reworked version of the deal was brokered last month. \u201cThis could be somewhat like the fact that they were going to end NAFTA, and then ended up negotiating some small changes,\u201d Corker said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cSo this could be something - just a precursor - to try to get Russia to come into compliance.\u201d Corker said quitting the treaty had not come up in a talk with Trump\u2019s Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.
