The Six Nations champions laid down a massive marker ahead of next year\u2019s World Cup by beating the All Blacks in commanding fashion to record just their second victory over the world champions in more than 100 years. \u201cThe way it had been built up as one v two, I thought it was a heavyweight clash and I just thought it was a fantastic test match,\u201d Schmidt told a news conference after the 16-9 win. \u201cIt was an incredibly collective, hard-earned win... I\u2019m incredibly proud of the group of Irish players who went out and did what they did tonight.\u201d That collective effort was underlined by the fact that Ireland\u2019s backline was shorn of the influential Conor Murray and Robbie Henshaw, while they also lost flankers Sean O\u2019Brien and Dan Leavy to injury over the last week. As well as notching their 17th win in the last 18 games and marking two years unbeaten at home, Ireland also became the first team, apart the British and Irish Lions, to leave the All Blacks try-less since 2014. Schmidt credited the \u201csuper job\u201d done by his defence coach, former England rugby league and union international Andy Farrell, and also singled out forwards coach Simon Easterby and scrum coach Greg Feek for their efforts. \u201cI know a lot of people thought that our lineout was a bit flimsy last week but I thought our first half lineout was a fantastic platform to springboard into the game, as was the scrum. Greg Feek is a bit of an unsung hero there as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, I\u2019ve got a team behind the team who do a super job.\u201d However Schmidt was typically modest when asked about his role in the brilliant lineout move that led to the game\u2019s decisive and only try for Jacob Stockdale. \u201cI mostly steal them from other people. I\u2019m always on the look out, I\u2019m always keeping my eye out. I watched the (New Zealand) Mitre 10 Cup, they\u2019ve always got a couple of good ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve come up with some incredibly poor moves in my time.\u201d (Reporting by Padraic Halpin Editing by Toby Davis)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
