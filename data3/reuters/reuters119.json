The visitors got off to the best possible start with a try from Ramiro Moyano just seconds after kick-off. But Thomas scored one try after 25 minutes and another eight minutes into the second half after superb work from centre Gael Fickou. Hooker Guirado sealed victory for the home side with a try nine minutes from time after he capitalized on a handling error just metres from the line. Nicolas Sanchez scored two penalties and a conversion for the Pumas and Baptiste Serin kicked 13 points for \u2018les Bleus\u2019 in a scrappy match.
