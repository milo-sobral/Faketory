{"id": "Thomas scores two tries as France beat Argentina 28-13", "paragraph": "3 Min ReadLILLE, France (Reuters) - Winger Teddy Thomas scored a try in each half and skipper Guilhem Guirado grabbed a third as France inflicted a convincing 28-13 defeat over Argentina to snap a five-game losing streak. The visitors got off to the best possible start with a try to Ramiro Moyano just seconds after kick-off. But Thomas crossed after 25 minutes and again eight minutes into the second half after superb work from centre Gael Fickou. Hooker Guirado sealed victory with a try nine minutes from time after he capitalised on a handling error just metres from the line. Nicolas Sanchez scored two penalties and a conversion for the Pumas and Baptiste Serin kicked 13 points for \u2018les Bleus\u2019 in a scrappy match. \u201cThe team responded very well after taking the first score,\u201d French coach Jacques Brunel said in comments published by L\u2019Equipe. \u201cWe are satisfied on the one hand because we won and on the other hand because of the way we won.\u201d Both sides were desperate for a win after disappointing results last week, with the French losing in stoppage time to South Africa and Argentina struggling to a 28-17 defeat by Ireland. The Pumas started well but were overpowered by a French team who were simply too strong and too fast. The win in Lille was France\u2019s first since March, when they beat England in the Six Nations. It also extended Argentina\u2019s losing run to four matches. The South Americans now travel to Murrayfield to play Scotland next Saturday, while France take on Fiji in Paris the same day. \u201cWe failed in areas where we weren\u2019t failing before,\u201d said Argentina number eight Javier Ortega. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do well arming the maul and we also had problems in the scrum.\u201d \u201cThis week we have to take a look at ourselves, without beating ourselves up, and focus on the work that each one of us can do to get back to to our best for the game next week against Scotland.\u201d The match was an early preview of what is to come in the 2019 World Cup, with both sides drawn together in a pool with England, the United States and Tonga.
