{"id": "Trump: U.S. to exit nuclear treaty, citing Russian violations", "paragraph": "2 Min ReadELKO, Nev., Oct 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Saturday the United States will exit the Cold-War era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that eliminated a class of nuclear weapons, in a move that is likely to upset Russia. The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1988, required elimination of short-range and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles by both countries. \u201cRussia has not, unfortunately, honored the agreement so we\u2019re going to terminate the agreement and we\u2019re going to pull out,\u201d Trump told reporters after a rally in Nevada. Washington believes Moscow is developing a ground-launched system in breach of the INF treaty that could allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice. Russia has consistently denied any such violation. Trump said the United States will develop the weapons unless Russia and China agree to a halt on development. China is not a party to the treaty and has invested heavily in conventional missiles as part of an anti-access/area denial strategy, while the INF has banned U.S possession of ground- launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles of ranges between 500 and 5,500 km (311 and 3,418 miles). Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, will visit Moscow next week. (Reporting by Jeff Mason Editing by Alistair Bell)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
