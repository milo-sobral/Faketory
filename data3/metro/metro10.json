Cuadrilla\u2019s only safe option is to cease fracking.\u2019Blackpool, Lancashire, has been at the centre of the angry debate over fracking after two earthquakes in 2011 forced the practice to stop.Initial studies by the British Geological Society suggested the quakes were linked to the fracking activities while an independent report found \u2018most likely, the repeated seismicity was induced by direct injection of fluid into the fault zone.\u2019Earlier this week, gas\u00a0firm Cuadrilla announced they were back at one of their shale gas drilling sites after campaigners lost a last-minute legal challenge at the high court.Less than 72 hours later, Blackpool was hit with three minor quakes on Thursday at\u00a03.48pm, 10.54pm and 11.44pm.They were at minus levels and the low levels of seismic activity meant they would not have been felt by residents.However on Friday afternoon at 1.20pm, Blackpool was hit by quake with a 0.3 magnitude, which experts are now monitoring because it has reached a level where fracking should be reconsidered.Rose Dickinson, Friends of the Earth campaigner told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Today has been seismic activity at the fracking site in Lancashire hitting amber on the government\u2019s own monitoring scale, meaning Cuadrilla has to \u201cproceed at caution\u201d.\u2018It\u2019s only been 4 days since they started fracking. This is why it\u2019s right that this site has to be so closely monitored, and it should continue to be.\u2019Fracking, or Hydraulic Fracturing, involves pumping vast quantities of water and chemicals into unstable rock to release combustible gas.Drilling for shale gas is still at an exploratory phase. However, reserves of shale gas have been identified across large swathes of the UK, particularly in northern England.More than 100 licences have been awarded by the government, allowing firms to pursue a range of oil and gas exploration activities in certain areas.Since the 2011 earthquakes, local residents and environmental campaigners have been fighting Cuadrilla\u2019s plan to restart their Lancashire operations.Lancashire County Council had also been opposed to the plan but the government forced permission through.Last week, Cuadrilla fought off an 11th hour legal challenge brought by a retired Lancashire businessman, Bob Dennett.On Monday, Cuadrilla began fracking operations at their Preston New Road site, Lancashire.On Thursday, three quakes were felt near Penny Farm, just west of the fracturing site measuring -0.2, -0.8 and -0.3, according to the British Geological Survey.Friday\u2019s went into positive territory, with a depth of 3km and reaching 0.3 on the scale.The industry is regulated by a traffic light system, introduced after the 2011 tremors.Green is zero-magnitude on the Richter scale, amber is anything up to 0.5, meaning fracking should proceed with caution and potentially at a slower rate.Red is anything at 0.5-magnitude or greater, meaning operations are suspended immediately.Cuadrilla have said the latest quakes are nothing to be concerned about because they are so low on the scale.The Government has been pro-fracking despite concerns over climate change.When Theresa May came to power, she announced householders living near shale wells would enjoy a \u2018frackpot\u2019 payout of up to \u00a310,000 each.However the UN\u2019s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change launched a new report only two weeks ago bringing forward the dangerous limits of climate change and calling on world leaders to take immediate action to bring global warming under control by 2040.The extensive list of measures required includes a diverse energy mix of 85 per cent renewables and practically no coal, oil or gas.Today campaign group Frack Free Lancashire said: \u2018We will\u00a0continue to monitor\u00a0these\u00a0events closely. Considering the relevant past history with the Fylde Coast\u2019s geology and having two significant seismic events which effectively shut down the fracking industry, all eyes are currently on Cuadrilla.\u2018These events may be dismissed as being minor and \u201ccan\u2019t be felt\u201d but what occurs under the earth is beyond anyone\u2019s control.\u2019Environmental campaigners and local residents are planning to hold a \u2018national climate crisis rally\u2019 later this month.They have been at the Preston New Road site campaigning against fracking from the start.In the same week, three anti-fracking protesters jailed for causing a public nuisance at the Preston New Road site were freed by the Court of Appeal.Soil scientist Simon Blevins, 26, from Sheffield, and teacher Richard Roberts, 36, of London, were both jailed for 16 months, while piano restorer Rich Loizou, 31, from Devon, was given 15 months in September.The trio had climbed onto lorries in a protest that lasted almost 100 hours.But their sentences were replaced with conditional discharges by three senior judges sitting in London on Wednesday.Speaking about Thursday\u2019s earthquakes, a spokesman for Cuadrilla said: \u2018Three microseismic events were detected yesterday by the highly sensitive Traffic Light System Cuadrilla has installed around the Preston New Road site and were very far below levels that could be felt at surface.\u2018The recordings from these seismometers are shared with the British Geological Survey to help them reassure the public that operations are continuing safely as planned.\u2018We take the monitoring and regulation of seismicity seriously, with daily reports sent to the regulators.\u2018The microseismic events recorded were extremely low and well within the Green Light threshold and confirm that the monitoring system is working to the highest standard.\u2019If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
