I felt awful, so helpless.\u2018The colour just drained from him. He went grey and his lips went blue. He just looked dead.\u2018I felt like I was screaming, but apparently I was just shouting Riley\u2019s name, over and over again.\u2019The hospital staff brought him back, only to be forced to resuscitate him a second time later.Rachael, who also has a three-year-old son Ethan, said: \u2018Our ultimate Christmas wish is to get Riley home, to have a lovely Christmas together watching films and snuggling on the sofa.\u2018But until then, all we\u2019re wishing for is for Riley to be healthy and happy.\u2019If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
