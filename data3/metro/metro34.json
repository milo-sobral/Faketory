{"id": "World\u2019s oldest shipwreck dating back 2,500 years to ancient Greece is found under the Black\u00a0Sea", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesThe world\u2019s oldest intact shipwreck has been discovered resting at the bottom of the Black Sea.After the most technologically advanced search ever, the ancient vessel was found in a part of the eastern European sea that has already revealed over 60 other shipwrecks.But carbon dating shows that this is the oldest yet discovered, and is believed to be a Greek trading vessel that\u2019s over 2,500 years old.It was discovered in late 2017 as part of the Black Sea Maritime Archaeological Project. It bears a resemblance to the ship design displayed on the \u2018Siren Vase\u2019 \u2013 a piece of ancient Greek pottery currently on display at the British Museum.Dr Kroum Batchvarov, who was involved in the project, said: \u2018We have complete vessel, with the masts still standing, with the quarter rudders in place.\u2019\u2018It is an incredible find. The first of its kind ever.\u2019It was found 1.3 miles beneath the surface of the Black Sea in waters that are known as anoxic due to the minimal amount of oxygen that exist there. The lack of oxygen is what\u2019s contributed to the boat\u2019s preservation. It\u2019s so well preserved that monkfish bones were found on deck, showing what the sailors were eating at the time.\u2018We even have the coils of line, of rope still as the bosun left them in the stern when the ship went down,\u2019 Dr Batchvarov said.\u2018This is unique.\u2019Jon Adams, the project\u2019s chief scientist, told the Times that the ship probably sank in a storm and the crew weren\u2019t able to bail out the water in time.\u2018A ship, surviving intact, from the Classical world, lying in over 2km of water, is something I would never have believed possible,\u2019 he said\u2018This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world.\u2019The team from the Black Sea Maritime Archaeological Project can\u2019t yet salvage the vessel because of the expense of doing so as well as the necessary work to take it apart and piece it back together without damaging it.The find is one of 67 wrecks found in the area.Previous finds were discovered dating back as far as 2,500 years, including galleys from the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires.Scientists stumbled upon the graveyard while using underwater robots to survey the effects of climate change along the Bulgarian coast.The years-long Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project involves an international team led by the University of Southampton\u2019s Centre for Maritime Archaeology. It has so far cost around \u00a315m.Ed Parker, CEO of Black Sea MAP, said: \u2018Some of the ships we discovered had only been seen on murals and mosaics until this moment.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s one medieval trading vessel where the towers on the bow and stern are pretty much still there.\u2018It\u2019s as if you are looking at a ship in a movie, with ropes still on the deck and carvings in the wood.\u2018When I saw that ship, the excitement really started to mount \u2013 what we have found is truly unrivalled.\u2019Many of the other wrecks\u2019 details and locations are being kept secret by the team to ensure they remain undisturbed."}
