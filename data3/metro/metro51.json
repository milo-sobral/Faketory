But 20-year-old Sydney Allen was caught out in the most spectacular fashion when her secret nipple piercings were exposed in an X-ray.Sydney, from Clearwater in Florida, had got the piercings done in June as a birthday present from her sister.But they decided to keep it from their parents, and Sydney told Buzzfeed News that her mum \u2018is a bit conservative on appearances and hates tattoos and piercings\u2019.Her mum was none the wiser, until Sydney needed to go for a checkup at the hospital.Sydney suffers from\u00a0syringomyelia, a rare condition\u00a0caused by Chiari malformation \u2013 where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal and can cause fluid to build up on the spinal cord and could potentially damage it.She needed a routine X-ray to check everything was ok and took her mum along for some moral support.But what she didn\u2019t factor in was that the X-ray would reveal her secret to everyone in the room.Sydney said: \u2018My mom saw my piercings as soon as the X-ray popped up and the doctor and I started laughing hysterically.\u2019Her mum initially didn\u2019t take it too well, and just said: \u2018We will discuss it later.\u2019But she soon came round to the idea, as the piercings are usually invisible, and people on social media found it hilarious.Girl, I feel ya pic.twitter.com/zOlfthrFHL\u2014 \u3164grim (@treefuzzz) October 24, 2018@Sydney_allenn You must\u2019ve been in the room after like https://t.co/TliL3MPfiR@Sydney_allenn Your mom getting a closer look at the xrays https://t.co/2obxXtUetpSydney\u2019s story went viral and she is now in touch with people who suffer from the same condition.She added: \u2018I was getting the X-ray to check the alignment of my spine,\u2019 she told PA.\u2018If my spine is aligned it helps relieve pain a bit.\u2018It\u2019s a pretty rare disease and I have never talked to anyone my age that also has it so it has been really awesome to discuss tips and doctor referrals.\u2019If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
