{"id": "Leaked Avengers 4 behind the scenes finally shows Pepper Potts in Rescue\u00a0armour", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesStill months out from any real Avengers news in the lead-up for the fourth instalment, new pictures have emerged of Gwyneth Paltrow in costume.Pepper Potts has remained relatively quiet on the Avengers front, not being part of any great big chatter or leak.Until now.As the costumes of characters are designed, tested, tried on, a photo of Gwyn as PP has emerged on social media and there is a lot to unpack here as it looks like the CEO of Start Industries will surface as Rescue in Avengers 4.A photo has been posted to account Uncanny Comic Quest that shows a recently-married Gwyneth in costume as Pepper, only she\u2019s not sporting her usual business attire \u2013 she\u2019s wearing the leather and armoured Rescue range, as she stands in front of a green screen. [follow @uncannycomicquest] yooooo does Tony die and Pepper takes her revenge out on Thanos?! Let us know in the comments below!\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffbA post shared by  UNCANNY COMIC QUEST (@uncannycomicquest) on Oct 23, 2018 at 9:09am PDTIn the comic series, Pepper gets an Iron Man suit of her own known as Rescue, and while her role in Infinity War really didn\u2019t amount to much, this is the biggest hint yet she\u2019s going to get in on the action this time around.With half the universe obliterated by Thanos\u2019 snap, we really could do with some more action heroes around now, too.Recent leaks showed toy designs with a purple armour that was pretty similar to Iron Man\u2019s but for a female.Cue Pepper Potts, recently engaged to Tony Stark, too \u2013 is she out to avenge his honour should he come into any danger in the next movie?While we don\u2019t know where the image originally came from and it hasn\u2019t been confirmed as her legit costume by Marvel \u2013 it doesn\u2019t appear to be doctored or fake and we have seen some random leaks of both Captain America and Captain Marvel\u2019s outfits for the coming release. So it wouldn\u2019t be weird for images of Pep to be floating about.It\u2019s also not the craziest idea, having Pepper suit up to defeat Thanos in the next battle, after Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige claimed that\u00a0the majority of superheroes\u00a0in the MCU would soon be female.Who run the world? Girls.\u2018As the plan goes forward I think frankly we\u2019ll be \u2026 you know, eventually I think we\u2019re going to reach a time where it\u2019s not just \u2026 listen, it would be amazing to see all of our female characters the way we have seen \u2026 most, never all male, but primarily male,\u2019 he told CinemaBlend. \u2018I think we\u2019re getting to the point soon where we have so many great female characters that those are just our heroes as opposed to when are they all female, all male. It\u2019s just the Marvel heroes, more than half of which will be women.\u2019Gwyneth Paltrow's Stan Lee tribute has not gone down well at allGwyneth Paltrow 'slays' distracting new husband with her boobs in argumentChris Martin reveals he felt 'worthless' after Gwyneth Paltrow splitWhile it was a little rambly, sure, it\u2019s a great step and Pepper\u2019s potential costume for the next film only gets us even more amped for a little MCU shakeup.Avengers 4 is in cinemas 26 April 2019.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Avengers 4 theory suggests Tony Stark and Steve Rogers will reunite only in flashbackMORE: Chris Hemsworth, ultimate legend, picks up hitchhiker and takes him on helicopter ride\n\n\n\n"}
