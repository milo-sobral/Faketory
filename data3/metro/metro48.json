{"id": "Suga from BTS\u2019 definition of Kpop comes to light: I don\u2019t like calling it a\u00a0genre", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesBTS\u2019 Suga says Kpop isn\u2019t a genre \u2013 it\u2019s something much more.The erudite South Korean singer, who the Army often praises for his intelligence, revealed that he\u2019s thought quite hard about what Kpop does, and doesn\u2019t mean for music.During their visit to the US, the multi-award-winning Korean band had a Q&A at the Grammy Museum with executive director Scott Goldman, which the museum recently uploaded on its Facebook page.There, they were asked about Kpop music as a genre. Is that an accurate categorisation of their music?After a moment of silence Suga picked up the mic and responded: \u2018I\u2019m a little careful to talk about Kpop as a genre because I don\u2019t want to be defining Kpop as a genre,\u2019 he told Goldman.\u2018I\u2019m a little bit wary of that but I think rather than approach Kpop as a genre, a better approach would be \u201cintegrated content\u201d.\u2019Sorry, this video isn't available any more.\u2018Kpop includes not just the music, but the clothes, the makeup, the choreography\u2026all these elements I think sort of amalgamate together in a visual and auditory content package, that I think sets it apart from other music or maybe other genres so again, as I said, rather than approach Kpop as it\u2019s own genre I think approaching it as this integration of different content would be better.\u2019The idea that Kpop is a form \u2018integrated content\u2019 was touched on earlier this week, when film festival director Hyejung Jeon exclusively told Metro.co.uk that BTS\u2019 popularity lays with how versatile they are \u2013 and because they satisfy all our senses.\u2018They say BTS is like Beatles\u2026,\u2019 she said. \u2018Well, they\u2019re so popular because of social media. And they don\u2019t just sing \u2013 it\u2019s total culture: music, art, fashion\u2026everything. We can show everything.\u2019Golden maknae Jungkook also addressed the topic, saying that he enriches his musical knowledge by listening to lots of different genres \u2013 not just Kpop.Jessie J hasn't given up on hopes of becoming a mother naturally after refusing a hysterecJustin Bieber finally settles lawsuit for egging neighbour's houseJessica Chastain and husband Gian Luca 'welcome their first child by surrogate'\u2018I try not to categorise the music that I listen to. So I listen to a lot of Kpop, I listen to a lot of American pop or international music. I listen to the lyrics and I try not to set the lyrics apart.\u2018I listen to the English lyrics and sometimes that gives me inspiration.\u2019\u2018So right now, for me, I\u2019m trying to listen to as many genres of music as possible and as broadly as possible.\u2019BTS are set to perform in Tokyo on 13 November for the next leg of their world tour.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Miss Baek review: The noir film explodes out of South Korea, with a riveting performance from Han Ji-minMORE: \u2018Before BTS, we had B-Boys\u2019: LEAFF festival creator Hyejung Jeon talks about Korean culture\u2019s moment in the West\n\n\n\n"}
