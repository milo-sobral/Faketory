{"id": "Meet the woman dedicated to making activewear for women of all\u00a0sizes", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesStaying fit should be for everyone. Women of all sizes work out, play sport and stay active. You don\u2019t have to be a size 8 Instagram model to hit the gym, but it seems a lot of fitness retailers haven\u2019t got that memo.If you\u2019re a size 16 or bigger, it can be damn near impossible to find supportive, comfortable activewear. Sweaty Betty\u2019s largest size is an XL \u2013 which translates to a size 16. Lululemon pushes to a size 18, but not for every product.Nike and ASOS both have a plus-size range, reaching a size 32, and a size 30 respectively. But not enough brands have a plus-size range, and when so many people fall into this category \u2013 surely they shouldn\u2019t have to have a separate range at all.We\u2019re in the middle of a body-positivity revolution \u2013 so why are so many big brands still clinging on to archaic ideals about the female form? 45% of women in the UK are a size 16 or bigger \u2013 what message does it send to women if fitness brands are only catering for the smaller half of the population?Asics just released a new ad campaign featuring tiny Elite models \u2013 it sparked a conversation around the potentially damaging effects of this kind of imagery. Many women felt that by only using women who are no bigger than a size 6 as the face of a fitness brand, they were showing something that is dangerously unattainable.One woman battling to change the perception of active women is Lucy Arnold. She owns\u00a0Lucy Locket Loves\u00a0\u2013 an inclusive fitness brand dedicated to providing a larger range of sizes.Lucy has just launched an ad campaign featuring women of all sizes, as an alternative to Asics\u2019.\u2018This year has been the year of a the woman, with campaigns including Time\u2019s Up and #MeToo. But still, we are faced with unrealistic images and poor representation within marketing and advertising,\u2019 Lucy tells Metro.co.uk.\u2018The new Asics campaign is part of this problem. Fitness is a real issue for many women, especially those who struggle to get fit, and having these \u201cperfect\u201d images thrust in our faces does a lot more harm than good.\u2019Lucy thinks brands have created an intrinsic disconnect with their core customers \u2013 and they aren\u2019t listening to what women actually want.\u2018So many of my\u00a0customers\u00a0tell me how hard it is to get activewear that fits\u00a0properly\u00a0when you are a size 16 and above, that it\u2019s\u00a0almost\u00a0impossible. We live in a\u00a0society that is constantly\u00a0telling us that we need to be unhappy with our bodies \u2013 we need to be skinnier, but still have curves \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u2018If we want people to learn to love themselves and create a love of exercise, they need to feel\u00a0comfortable whilst\u00a0exercising.\u00a0They need to know that they can do a workout and feel great and have kit that fits\u00a0properly. We want to help everybody, whatever the journey they are on and\u00a0wherever\u00a0they are.\u2019Lucy is convinced that the way to help women boost their confidence is through accessibility and inclusivity \u2013 they need to see themselves reflected int eh images around them.\u2018We can build confidence\u00a0by taking\u00a0away this imperfect ideal we see in the media every single day. I\u2019m a\u00a0size 14 personal trainer\u00a0and\u00a0owner of a fitness brand, people tell me how much I have\u00a0helped empower and support\u00a0them through social media. How it made them realise they are perfectly normal and they should stop trying to be who the media tells them to be and learn to love themselves.\u2018Alone we are one drop but\u00a0together we are an\u00a0ocean. What we want to do is showcase\u00a0every single\u00a0size and\u00a0represent the nation as a whole, not just a\u00a0tiny part of it. If\u00a0people thought it was normal to be different shapes and sizes, they would feel so much more confident about doing exercise and this is\u00a0what I want to do.\u2019The Asics advert sparked a furious response online as both men and women expressed their anger at the collaboration. Lucy thinks people are simply tired of outdated campaigns designed to make women feel bad about themselves.\u2018These adverts aren\u2019t empowering,\u2019 Lucy explains.\u2018They are not promoting that\u00a0exercise is for\u00a0everybody. They are not showcasing the size 18 lady who just\u00a0completed a marathon. Or the size 8 and size 14 mum and daughter attending a\u00a0class\u00a0together. They\u00a0aren\u2019t showcasing what\u00a0actually happens in gyms and running clubs around the world, and\u00a0they are not\u00a0encouraging anybody to start exercising.\u2018All they\u2019re actually doing is leaving out so many of their own\u00a0customers in their own campaigns \u2013 which is nonsensical.\u2019Women face huge, systemic barriers to staying fit \u2013 the burden of childcare and taking on the bulk of domestic duties is one barrier, but another is fear of judgment and societal pressures to look a certain way.Inclusivity is key if we want to create a culture of genuine body positivity and acceptance. If a woman can walk into a shop and find a pair of gym leggings that fit her, support her and make her feel good \u2013 it could be the first step in changing attitudes and re-establishing body norms.MORE: Asics using Elite models in their latest campaign is a monumental step back for women\u2019s sportsMORE: Staying fit could help you find loveMORE: It\u2019s never too late to start running \u2013 I just ran my first half marathon at 65"}
