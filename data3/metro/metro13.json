It was a nice experience and quite funny to watch.\u2018I enjoyed it and it was comforting to see her smiling.\u2018It would be great if they could do it with every patient because it really made a difference. She loved it.\u2018Hospitals can be overwhelming for little ones so it was a great help.\u2019Julie Clerc, matron at University Hospitals of Leicester said: \u2018Surgery can be an extremely daunting time for most people, let alone a child.\u2018We do everything we can to make the journey from the ward to the theatre as comfortable as possible but sometimes the experience can unnerve the most confident person.Going to the gym should never be about guiltWhole Foods shares the healthy food trends we'll all be fans of in 2019Having to admit that I can't cope with my daughter's cancer is the hardest thing I've done\u2018We wanted to think of ways that would make the trip more enjoyable for the younger children.\u2019Chris Sturgess, chairman of Sturgess Motor Group, added: \u2018The children\u2019s hospital at Leicester Royal Infirmary have taken care of members of the Sturgess family, and this was one way we felt that we could give back.\u2018It was an honour to deliver these five electric cars to the children in an attempt to make their experience less daunting whilst going to the operating theatre.\u2019Once the vehicles have had their full MOTs, they will be in full operation and ready to help make children\u2019s journeys to surgery much easier, less daunting experience.MORE: A pub wants to pay someone \u00a3500 to drink beer, eat food and watch sportsMORE: Same-sex penguin couple Magic and Sphen are to become parents"}
