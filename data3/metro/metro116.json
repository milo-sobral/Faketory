We had two boys so she was very much wanted.\u2018She was so happy and she loved telling me about her day at school, friends and her teachers.\u2018She would attend car shows and she made some very special friends through Ford Mania.\u2018She was happy and beautiful \u2013 she was such a joy to be around.\u2018She lived for the moment and she taught me that life is very precious.\u2018She was always friendly and she was loving. She was amazing and I am still so proud to have had such a wonderful daughter.\u2018I am proud to be her mother and will love her forever.\u2019Tracey had taken her daughter to be looked after by her grandma Janet Walerzak, 61, thinking she was simply poorly.The family have been told that tragically there was very little that could have been done to save Jessica\u2019s life.\u2018Doctors told us she had a very slim chance of survival \u2013 even if she had been on the doorstep of the hospital and it happened, it would have been too late,\u2019 Tracey\u2019s partner Ian Taylor.\u2018In the days leading up to her death Jess was enjoying a normal, happy life doing the sort of things any other child would. There were no signs she was ill.\u2018She was full of life, singing and dancing. She was a lover of music, she always had her headphones on doing little selfie videos.\u2018Then this happened \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely tragic.\u2019A white-horse drawn carriage carried her coffin to her funeral\u00a0at St Emmanuel Church in Bentley yesterday with mourners wearing pink or displaying #TeamJess, the family\u2019s fundraising hashtag.Tracey said: \u2018The way the brain haemorrhage took my daughter so suddenly made me realise that we should never take life for granted.\u2018It has made me realise that life is short and to treasure what\u2019s important in your life.\u2018The day was very emotional, but I wanted the best for her.\u2019Weak brain blood vessels affect just one in 1,000 people and can burst at any time as a result of coughing, sneezing or straining.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
