It looked pretty flimsy to say the least,\u2019 he said.\u2018There were far too many kids on it.\u2018It didn\u2019t look like it could hold that many people.\u2019The journalist, who lives in Guildford, Surrey, said that he noticed the flashing lights of ambulances after walking off with friends.\u2018I immediately thought that\u2019s going to be the slide,\u2019 he said.\u2018It looked like there were too many children on it and the side area had given way,\u2019 he said.\u2018If, heaven forbid, they fell from the top I would say it\u2019s at least 25 to 30-ft tall.\u2019Local musician Anna Neale said she was among the hundreds of people who evacuated the park, which had been packed with families with young children.The 36-year-old said: \u2018We saw all the blue lights and saw the air ambulance arriving.
