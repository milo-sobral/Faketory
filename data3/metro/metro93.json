{"id": "Weekend Hot Topic, part 2: Next gen console\u00a0predictions", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesGameCentral readers detail what they want to see from the PS5 and Xbox Two, from 60fps graphics to backwards compatibility.The subject for this week\u2019s Hot Topic was suggested by reader gaz be rotten and asked what do you want from the next generation consoles? How much of an improvement do you expect from the graphics and what new features do you want to see?Most people agreed that a reveal was likely for the new machines next year, and there were a lot of common demands, including keeping a disc drive, better artificial intelligence, and improved VR headsets.\u00a0I think the only thing I definitely want from the next gen consoles is a reason to exist. I don\u2019t mean that in a super cynical way, but I\u2019d like there to be an obvious reason why they had to be made now when I think most people would be perfectly happy with the current generation going on for several more years.Knowing how PCs are at the moment it\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that the graphics are going to be that much better, which makes me worry that Sony and Microsoft are going to invent some nonsense, like 8K, and pretend that\u2019s a good reason for the new consoles to be.Streaming is definitely something of interest to me but if the whole point is that it can run on any device then that\u2019s definitely not a reason for a new generation, the opposite really. Of course I want the best graphics possible but what I don\u2019t want to be doing is spending \u00a3400 every three or four years to get it. But we\u2019ll have to see I guess, I hope Microsoft and Sony realise this would be a problem and will try to avoid it.Hammeriron\n\u00a0I don\u2019t know anything about hardware really but what I do hope becomes a standard in the next generation is games pass. So far it\u2019s been excellent value and while I do worry whether Microsoft are only being generous because they\u2019re behind I am very happy to pay the subscription and have easy access to the games.It has to be said though that it would be even better value if Microsoft actually had any first person games to put on it. So if Sony did the same thing that would be even better. Although I somehow get the feeling they\u2019re not that keen on it, perhaps because their games sell perfectly well at the moment the normal way.Funnily enough Nintendo do seem interested and unless I\u2019m misinterpreting things they seem to be implying that they want to build up their online service to be something similar, although perhaps only retro games for the first few years.TalkTalk\n\u00a0Some of my favourite ever games have been on PlayStation 4 but I still can\u2019t shake the feeling that the majority of them could\u2019ve been done on PlayStation 3, albeit with lower resolution. It wasn\u2019t until PlayStation VR that I got the first new gen jaw drop.As a result, for next gen I\u2019d like to see consoles/games that look for advancements in artificial intelligence and world interactivity. Games that feel different, not just look shinier. You can\u2019t easily advertise these features tho\u2019 so I\u2019m expecting 4K to still be the main buzzword.I\u2019ve never considered backwards compatibility to be an important feature before but looking at how Microsoft have implemented it on Xbox One X with auto enhancements, etc. I think this will be included in all future consoles. And backwards compatibility would be a huge benefit for VR if there is a PlayStation VR 2 alongside the PlayStation 5.Please though, forget the idea of forwards compatibility. I don\u2019t want an entire generation of basically cross-gen games and hate the idea that the only enhancements to gaming in the years to come is visual bells and whistles.As to when these new consoles will be released, my money is on early 2020 with hopefully an E3 2019 reveal.Adam\n\u00a0E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\u00a0Every time the next generation talk starts up I always end up hoping for holograms but it never happens. I did see a demo of some kind of tablet like thing the other day but I still don\u2019t think this is the gen when my dreams will come true. That would be the ultimate though.Mind you, I use to also always wish for good VR and that has actually happened to a degree. PlayStation VR has been great, with a really fantastic line-up of games now. So my real hope for the next gen is that we get a version 2 that\u2019s higher quality, better resolution and the same or lower price.The future is slow catching up with my imagination but I think it\u2019ll be the PlayStation 6 or 7 before it\u2019s entirely there.Johnson\n\u00a0I\u2019d like to see some innovation in the controllers for the next generation. Microsoft and Sony always leave that up to Nintendo and I think the PlayStation in particular is in desperate need of a complete rethink. I\u2019d like to see an end to the DualShock and its horrible analogue sticks once and for all.Getting slightly better every generation is not good enough, as it always means it\u2019s at least two steps behind Microsoft. All these decades later we shouldn\u2019t be using basically the same control system as we had for PS1 games.I\u2019d particularly like to do away with the right analogue stick as I hate controlling the camera in games and I\u2019ve noticed that with many people this is what puts them off playing more complicated games. I know that\u2019s the case with my girlfriend in particular.I think the ideal solution would be to get the game itself to handle that stuff. You\u2019d think artificial intelligence would have advanced enough by now to work out how to point the camera where you\u2019re going, but apparently not. Or maybe eye-tracking could become standard. Although I\u2019m not sure what happens with that when you glance at something other than the TV.Scooter\n\u00a0For the next generation of consoles I want better enemies. Not better-looking enemies but smarter ones, so I guess they would need a lot of CPU power to process the artificial intelligence.Games look great as it is now so graphical improvements isn\u2019t that necessary. VR isn\u2019t what it could be so skip that as well as motion controls, as we tried that already.bobwallett\n\u00a0Catch up on every previous Games Inbox here\u00a0With the next gen nearly upon us, there are a few things I\u2019d like to see from the next generation of consoles.Obviously graphics will be slightly shinier, and I hope they manage to reach a steady 60fps in each game, with 4K obviously going to be pushed for as well. While better graphics are welcome, I feel the artificial intelligence needs to improve a lot, as it hasn\u2019t developed much over the past few console generations. I\u2019d also like the ability to access my full PlayStation digital library on the PlayStation 5, as Microsoft are doing with the Xbox. I also hope they keep a physical media drive, as I still want the choice between buying a game as a download or a disc, and the ability to play my Blu-rays and DVDs.With PlayStation VR beginning to hit its stride, I\u2019d like to see an improved headset that is smaller and lighter with less wires and a better resolution. I\u2019d also like to see them redesign the Move controllers and make the glowing ping pong ball at least a bit smaller and include a thumbstick for movement.I\u2019ve also used Remote Play a lot on the PS Vita, which frees the TV for the family to use, and I\u2019d like to be able to use this feature on the next gen. Whether that means using streaming to a tablet or phone, or making the console more like the Switch it\u2019s something that gives you the flexibility to play games when you don\u2019t have access to the TV.I also hope that the diversity of games on offer increases, and we\u2019re not sold as many sequels year on year. I\u2019d much rather developers spent four or five years crafting an outstanding experience, than churning out yearly sequels that diminish in quality.Cubes (PSN ID)/SW-3654-9259-0500/Kevin M\n\u00a0E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\u00a0The small printNew Inbox updates appear twice daily, every weekday morning and afternoon.
