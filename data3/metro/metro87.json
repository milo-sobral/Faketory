{"id": "UK firms ready to microchip thousands of\u00a0employees", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesConcern is growing that UK firms are considering implanting microchips into their employees to boost security.Biohax, a Swedish company that provides human chip implants, told the Daily Telegraph it was \u2018in talks\u2019 with a number of UK legal and financial firms to implant staff with the devices.Apparently, one client has \u2018hundreds of thousands of employees\u2019 and probably believes that injecting chips into their workers is easier than issuing them with a security pass.\u2018These companies have sensitive documents they are dealing with,\u201d Jowan \u00d6sterlund, the founder of Biohax, told the paper.\u2018[The chips] would allow them to set restrictions for whoever,\u2019\u00a0\u00d6sterlund, a former professional body piercer, said.Naturally, not everyone is on board with this idea.A spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry told the Guardian: \u2018While technology is changing the way we work, this makes for distinctly uncomfortable reading.\u2018Firms should be concentrating on rather more immediate priorities and focusing on engaging their employees.\u2019Biohax says that its microchips, which are about the size of a grain of rice, cost \u00a3150 each.They are put into the skin between the thumb and forefinger and can be used like any kind of transmitter \u2013 to open doors or start a car, for example. They can also be loaded with medical data that can be accessed if the person was ever in an accident.\u00d6sterlund said bigger companies, like those with over 200,000 employees, could offer this as something optional to make their employees\u2019 lives easier and save the company money.\u2018If you have a 15% uptake that is still a huge number of people that won\u2019t require a physical ID pass,\u2019 he said."}
