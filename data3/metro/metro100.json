Work and work.. @manchesterunitedA post shared by  antoniovalencia2525 (@antoniovalencia2525) on Nov 1, 2018 at 6:31am PDT\u2018I watched something funny in his Instagram where he says \u2018work work work\u2019 in the gym,\u2019 said Mourinho before United\u2019s win over Bournemouth.\u2018He should say \u2018work work work alone because I am injured and I cannot train with the team\u2019.\u2018So the reason why he was in the gym was because he was injured and he couldn\u2019t train with the team.\u2018So I think it looked like he was working really, really hard and he was. But without the ball and without the team, so you can imagine that he is not selected because he is not ready.\u2019Harry Kane responds to Dejan Lovren's taunts ahead of England vs CroatiaSweden boss provides Victor Lindelof update after Man Utd star's injury scareJose Mourinho tells Man Utd to beat Chelsea to signing who solves TWO problem positionsValencia, however, has insisted this week that he is not injured and has been left out of the team because of Mourinho.\u2018The relationship with Mourinho has always been a good one,\u2019 Valencia told Ecuadorian radio station Area Deportiva radio.\u2018Right now I haven\u2019t been playing, but it\u2019s more of a tactical decision. The player who has been in my place [Ashley Young] has been playing well.\u2018You have to respect the decision.\u2018The only thing I can do is prepare and be ready for when he [Mourinho] needs me and be in the right condition to compete. I\u2019m calm right now and I know I\u2019ll get an opportunity to play again.\u2019Valencia\u2019s representatives are due at Carrington next week for talks over the defender\u2019s future but United could decide to offload him in January if discussions are not productive.Valencia was made captain by Mourinho in the summer but some of his decisions off the field have raised questions over the quality of his leadership.The most recent case came ahead of the Manchester derby when Valencia was not at United\u2019s team hotel with his teammates before the match.Valencia was also forced to apologise in October after liking an Instagram post which called for United to sack Mourinho.Ed Woodward blocking Jose Mourinho from reuniting with transfer guru who signed MbappeManchester United dealt fresh injury blow as Romelu Lukaku withdraws from Belgium squadJose Mourinho wants Man Utd to agree bargain transfer deal for Premier League star\n\n\n\n"}
