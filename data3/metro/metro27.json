We have a thriving Dutch community, and artistic and sporting exchanges are at an all-time high.\u2019Theresa May was also at the state banquet and seated near to the Dutch head of State.He used his address to those gathered at Buckingham Palace to reiterate his comments about his regret that the UK was leaving the EU, but added he respected the decision of the British people.He went on to personally praise the Queen, highlighting her now famous appearance in the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, describing her as the \u2018most fearless Bond Girl ever\u2019 for her role alongside 007 played by Daniel Craig.The Dutch monarch said: \u2018In recent decades, you have seen your country, Europe and the world change enormously. The world looks to you as a trusted beacon in the midst of upheaval.\u2018Your ability to keep in touch with the times is striking. You even have an adventurous streak, as you showed six years ago at the opening of the Olympic Games.\u2019Among the royal guests were the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, senior members of the Cabinet and leading figures from British and Dutch life.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had met the Dutch king earlier in the day, was represented by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry as he was believed to be attending a family event."}
