The level of brain activity we saw exceeded our expectations by far.\u2018Our data suggest that further investigation of ventral pallidum will be critical for understanding how we make decisions about eating.\u2018If we want to figure out why a food can be exciting in one scenario and disappointing in another, ventral pallidum could be the key.\u2019His team wanted to measure how the brain determines what and how much to eat, when someone has several food options with similar nutritional values.The process happens very quickly as we move along buffets, browse restaurants menus or glance into the fridge.Even when presented with a choice, the dish that\u2019s the favourite will likely be eaten faster and with bigger bites.The research team found that when rats were given two similar sugary drinks for several days \u2013 their preferred sucrose and the less popular maltodextrin (food additive).The ventral pallidum would fire up when the rats realised they were getting what they wanted.\u00a0But the brain area would became \u2018disappointed\u2019 and the rats didn\u2019t lick the treat faster when they realised they were drinking maltodextrin, according to the findings published in the journal, Nature Communications.When the scientists repeated the test with the same rats but replaced the sucrose water with plain water, they observed the same neutron activity as when the rodents realised they were drinking maltodextrin.Whole Foods shares the healthy food trends we'll all be fans of in 2019Yo!
