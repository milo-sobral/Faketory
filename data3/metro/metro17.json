{"id": "Canada has almost run out of weed two days after marijuana was\u00a0legalised", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesAfter just two days Canada has already started running out of weed with police being called to help at some stores.There were long queues and reports of shortages across different parts of the country with some being unable to buy cannabis.After waiting seven hours in line at a store in downtown Montreal on Wednesday, a man who only gave his name as Alexandre, 30, said he was turned away at closing at 9pm. Police stepped in to disperse the crowd, without incident.Other people have been shocked by the relatively high prices ranging from Can$5.25 (\u00a33.09) per gram in Quebec to $18.99 (\u00a311.16) per gram in Saskatchewan.Before it was legalised the average price per gram was $6.79 (\u00a33.99).\u2018It was hell, it was cold,\u2019 Alexandre said. \u2018But we had fun anyway, talking with people in the crowd and sharing joints.\u2019He was back early yesterday morning to try again.\u2018Yesterday was the day that everyone was waiting for but I think that little by little the queue will decrease,\u2019 he said.Genevieve Despres, 41, was one of the lucky ones to make it inside the store on Wednesday. She described the scene in line as \u2018super friendly, we sang, we laughed, I made friends.\u2019\u2018I do not usually smoke but since it was a historic day for Canada I thought I\u2019d try.\u2019Despres smoked bought pot with a low level of THC, the psychoactive agent in cannabis.\u2018My God it\u2019s the bomb!\u2019 she said \u2013 and returned with friends Thursday to buy more.In Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populated province, 38,000 orders for weed worth about $750,000 (\u00a3440,850)were processed in the first few hours on Wednesday, while in neighbouring Quebec 42,000 orders were processed in-store and online, smashing all expectations.\u2018This volume of orders far exceeds the forecasts of the SQDC,\u2019 the Quebec government pot retailer said.It said it was \u2018difficult to anticipate the volume of sales \u2026 given the lack of data from a sector that 48 hours ago was still illegal.\u2019The statement added that short-term supply shortages are expected due to \u2018the craze surrounding legalization of cannabis and the scarcity of product across Canada.\u2019Canada\u2019s smallest provinces on the Atlantic coast, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, posted $660,000 (\u00a3388,000) and Can$152,000 (\u00a390,000) in sales, respectively.Supply shortages were already reported in the provinces of Newfoundland and Saskatchewan, as well as in the Arctic territory of Nunavut.Several online retailers including the Ontario government\u2019s pot portal warned customers to expect shipping delays of up to five days as they worked late into the night filling orders.Canada Post workers are also poised to strike starting on Monday after more than a year of contract talks stalled, which could further delay deliveries of online orders.Canada on Wednesday became the world\u2019s first major economy and only the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalise the recreational use of cannabis and embark on the controversial experiment in drug policy.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has defended legalisation \u2013 the fulfilment of a 2015 campaign promise \u2013 as intended to protect young people and to shut down drug dealers.But there has been pushback from some doctors and the opposition Tories.In total, Statistics Canada says 5.4 million Canadians will buy cannabis from legal dispensaries in 2018 \u2013 about 15 percent of the population. Around 4.9 million already smoke.\u2018We expected, you know, certain strains might run out and there would be a bit of a run on supply,\u2019 Bill Blair, a former Toronto police chief who is the government\u2019s pointman for legalization, told public broadcaster CBC.\u2018But, you know, they\u2019ve got a pretty good infrastructure in place and I\u2019m confident it will work,\u2019 he said."}
