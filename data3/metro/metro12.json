I was constantly getting raped, beaten up.\u2019The judge noted that at least one girl attempted suicide.One of the girls was seen being thrown out of a moving car outside her home. She had bruises all over her face and was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.Judge Marson said at the end of the first trial: \u2018The way you treated these girls defies understanding; this abuse was vile and wicked.\u2018As cases of sexual abuse with which the courts have to deal, this case comes at the top of the scale. None of you has expressed any remorse for what you did.\u2019He added: \u2018The sentences I pass on you are severe and are intended to be so. They are intended to deter others from behaving in this way.\u2019Dhaliwal, of Holly Road, Huddersfield, was jailed in June along with seven other men, who received jail sentences of between eight and 18 years.After the second trial, which also ended in June, eight more men were given jail sentences of between five and 18 years.Four more men were found guilty of a range of offences earlier this month following the third trial and will be sentenced on November 1.The men referred to each other using a series of nicknames which were also used as their monikers during the trials.They included \u2018Beastie\u2019, \u2018Dracula\u2019 and \u2018Nurse\u2019.The pattern of large-scale exploitation of mainly white girls by groups of men of mainly Pakistani heritage uncovered by West Yorkshire Police in Huddersfield mirrors what has happened in a number of other towns including Rotherham, Rochdale and Telford.The restriction which banned reporting of the Huddersfield trials was lifted by the Recorder of Leeds Judge Guy Kearl QC following representations by a number of media organisations, including the Press Association.Of these, 16 have been jailed and four will be sentenced next month.Each was referred to by a nickname. Those convicted are:Trial OneTrial TwoTrial Three\nDetective Chief Inspector Ian Mottershaw, from West Yorkshire Police, who led the investigation, said: \u2018First and most importantly, I would like to pay tribute to each and every victim who came forward firstly to report these heinous crimes, but to go through the gruelling court process which has taken nearly a year to conclude and to bravely give their accounts to us and the court.\u2018I cannot praise them enough for their courage and tenacity in helping us secure justice for them against these defendants.\u2018The investigation into this case has been extremely complex and the investigative team have worked tirelessly for the past five years to ensure that no stone has been left unturned.\u2018We welcome the convictions and sentences which have been passed down throughout the year to these depraved individuals, who subjected vulnerable young children to unthinkable sexual and physical abuse.\u2019The Huddersfield grooming trials were allegedly put at risk by the antics of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, who flouted reporting restrictions designed to ensure the proceedings were fair.Robinson, a convicted fraudster who has also served time for assault and drugs offences, claimed the activities of the gang were being covered up because the offenders were of Asian origin.In reality, reporting of the case was only being postponed for well-established legal reasons.The restriction was put in place because the defendants were being dealt with in separate trials.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvicted fraudster Tommy Robinson could have led the case to have collapsed (Picture: PA)In such cases, reporting is sometimes postponed until the final case so jurors cannot be prejudiced by reading accounts of previous trials.Robinson claimed instead that the cases were being covered up because the men were Muslims in video footage which also showed him approaching defendants in the second trial as they approached Leeds Crown Court.The video was viewed on social media 250,000 times within hours.Robinson was given a 13-month jail term by Judge Geoffrey Marson QC in May, but was released from HMP Onley in Rugby on August 1 after successfully challenging the contempt of court ruling.However, Robinson was warned by Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, who took the decision to order his release with Mr Justice Turner and Mr Justice McGowan, that he could be sent back to jail if a ruling of contempt of court is made at a fresh hearing, due to take place at the Old Bailey on October 23.Robinson, identified by his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon in court documents, later said: \u2018The law\u2019s supposed to be blind, but it\u2019s not supposed to be deaf and dumb. I\u2019m being specifically targeted for who I am.\u2018I\u2019m on trial for speaking into a microphone.\u2019But the former British National Party supporter from Luton, whose case was taken up by the so-called alt-right in the US when he was jailed, was aware of the potential consequences of his actions at Leeds Crown Court.He had been given a suspended prison sentence for contempt of court in 2017 after trying to film three Asian men and a teenager who were on trial at Canterbury Crown Court accused of gang-raping a teenage girl.That trial was also subject to temporary reporting restrictions, which were also later lifted and the men involved were given 14-year jail sentences.Giving Robinson the suspended sentence for contempt in that case, the judge said her decision on whether to jail him had been on a \u2018knife-edge\u2019.Jailing him after the Leeds video, Judge Marson told him his actions could have caused the trial to be re-run, costing \u2018hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds\u2019.His lawyer Matthew Harding claimed Robinson had \u2018deep regret\u2019 for what he had done in Leeds and had been \u2018mindful, having spoken to others and taken advice, not to say things that he thought would actually prejudice these proceedings\u2019.But Judge Marson said: \u2018Not only was it a very long video, but I regard it as a serious aggravating feature that he was encouraging others to share it and it had been shared widely. That is the nature of the contempt.\u2019The judge added: \u2018Everyone understands the right to freedom of speech but there are responsibilities and obligations.\u2019\n"}
