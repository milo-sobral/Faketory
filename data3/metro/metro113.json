{"id": "Plenty of Brits reckon a robot would make smarter decisions than a human\u00a0boss", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesQuite a large number of British workers reckon a robot could make better business decisions than their own flesh-and-blood boss.That\u2019s according to a new report that found one in three (34%) of employees believe a robot would be better if it had access to the right business intelligence.The annual survey, called the Advanced Trends Report, is the third commissioned by British software and services company Advanced. The company asked over 1,000 professionals in UK organisations and found that only 35% of managing directors are said to be driving technology change.Nearly two-thirds (65%) of respondents said they would be happy to work alongside robotic technology if it meant less manual processes.In fact, the report said that 72% of these professionals have already adopted technology to automate tasks and processes, albeit many of these are likely using simple commands to handle defined actions.\u2018Disruptive technology is encouraging us to look afresh at all aspects of business,\u2019 says Gordon Wilson, CEO at Advanced.\u2018While robots are unlikely to take on the job of decision maker \u2013 the reality is that they are simply not yet suited to such complex tasks and will instead work side-by-side with humans \u2013 our findings suggest that employees are dissatisfied with their current leadership, want to get rid of arbitrary decision making and are starting to challenge the norms.\u2019\u2018Leaders need to step up, to provide the clear direction that people need and take charge of the intense technology change happening as a result of the digital era.\u2019The outlook of this report seems to be much more positive than one conducted a few months back.That one, carried out by YouGov and also surveying 1,000 Brits, suggested that a quarter of us are worried a \u2018droid will nick our jobs outright.That research was timed to coincide with a new two-year commission on workers\u2019 technology that will both address the change and help workers re-skill if necessary.\u2018The digital revolution means technology and jobs are changing faster than ever,\u2019 said Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the home affairs select committee, who backed the program.\u2018This survey of workers found that almost a quarter of workers are worried that their job will no longer be needed. And whilst it found that most people are optimistic that they will be able to change and update their skills, they also say they are not getting any help or support to train or adapt from the government, their employer or a trade union.\u2019What\u2019s the answer? We\u2019re not entirely sure. But we\u2019re not going to stop sucking up to our human boss just yet\u2026"}
