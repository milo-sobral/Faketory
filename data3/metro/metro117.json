As a result she had to quit her job.Beth had tried everything, and eventually became housebound to try to limit her pain.Then she saw an advert for CBD oil, and decided to give it a go.Now, she thanks CBD oil for \u2018saving her life\u2019.\u2018I didn\u2019t think there was any way to make my skin better, until I found CBD oil,\u2019 says Beth. \u2018I tried so many courses of medication, creams and anything that I was told would help my skin \u2013 but it never did.\u2018Just going out for a walk would leave my skin red-raw and I would be in so much pain, so I reluctantly had to become housebound to stop myself from feeling this way.\u2018On top of that, the severity of my scaly skin made me feel very self-conscious and I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me like that.\u2018But since I\u2019ve taken the oil it has truly saved my life \u2013 I am no longer in pain and I can happily leave the house now without feeling in pain or embarrassed.\u2019Cannabidiol \u2013 CBD for short \u2013 is one of the most common compounds found in cannabis and hemp leavesIt works by binding to cell receptors in the body that effect everyday functions such as sleep and appetite, as well as pain and mood regulationCBD has been used to treat epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and chronic painIt is taken as oil that you drip under the tongue, but can also be consumed as gummies, or inhaled using a vapeIt is not psychoactive, unlike the cannabis compound Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), so CBD does not produce the \u201chigh\u201d associated with cannabisCBD is legal to buy in the UK, but legal restrictions mean it is sold online as a food supplement, rather than a medicineResearch is ongoing, but more investment into clinical trials is needed to explore CBD\u2019s full potential as a medicine.Initial trials suggest CBD may be useful in helping people stop smoking, and even lessen withdrawal symptoms from painkiller addictionsCBD is used by sportsmen because of the effect it has on pain, inflammation and recoveryCBD is also being trialled for its use as a potential anti-cancer agent.Beth says she takes three spoonfuls of CBD oil a day before each meal, and claims that within a few days of the treatment her eczema had cleared and she was no longer in pain.\u2018Whilst doing my research I read a lot about CBD oil and the benefits that it can have on people\u2019s skin, but I was still trying a lot of other more conventional methods.\u2018But then one day whilst I was on social media, I saw someone who was selling the oil and thought I should give it a go.\u2018I\u2019d previously been recommended the oil by a good friend, so thought it was worth a try.\u2018Once I received it, it took only two days for it to clear up and my skin was no longer in pain.\u2018I now take three spoonfuls of it every day, before each meal, and my skin has been pretty much perfect ever since.Going to the gym should never be about guiltHaving to admit that I can't cope with my daughter's cancer is the hardest thing I've doneWeightlifting protects against heart disease better than running or cycling\u2018The oil costs me \u00a360 for a bottle, and that will last me two weeks, but I genuinely believe it is the best money I have ever spent.\u2018I really do have CBD oil to thank for giving me my life back \u2013 I would still be shut up in my house, losing friends and deteriorating my own mental health if it wasn\u2019t for the oil.\u2019MORE: When does stress become burnout?MORE: How is the cleaning craze affecting your skin?MORE: I\u2019m all for medical cannabis, but let\u2019s not assume it\u2019s better than medication for mental health issues"}
