{"id": "It has been so cold it even snowed in\u00a0Cornwall", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesTemperatures were so bitterly cold across the country on Saturday that even parts of Devon and Cornwall woke up to flurries of snow.After weeks of unseasonably warm weather, people were stunned to see the light dusting of snow in Truro, Bodmin and Land\u2019s End.Locals said it was the earliest they had seen snow settle there in years after the freezing cold snap that saw temperatures across the UK drop to as low as -3\u00b0C.Warwick Birder wrote on Twitter: \u2018Then four seasons in one car journey with gale force winds out near Land\u2019s End followed by a hail storm, torrential rain, snow and sleet over Bodmin and sunshine in Exeter.\u2019It followed a day of thick snow on Saturday in north east England, north Yorkshire and Country Durham, as well as parts of Scotland during what one meteorologist called \u2018some of the coldest October days in a decade\u2019.The Met Office has warned trick or treaters to wrap up warm if they are out and about on Halloween as the weather is going to be \u2018increasingly unsettled\u2019.But forecasters say that although it will remain chilly overnight, temperatures will return to normal next week.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u2018It will be a chilly week, but temperatures will recover closer to what they should be for the time of year.\u2019Forecaster John West added: \u2018It will be likely less cold by Wednesday but by no means warm.\u2018If anybody is going to be out and about on Wednesday it might be a good idea to have a coat handy and maybe also a waterproof.\u2019The Met Office expects showers will hit North Sea coastal areas on Monday but once any fog patches clear, it should be largely dry elsewhere with plenty of sunshine but still cold.It should turn wet and windy across many eastern areas on Tuesday, with snow possible across Scottish hills.By Thursday morning temperatures are expected to be around freezing for Scotland, between 4-5C in London and there may be a touch of frost in the north west with temperatures of around 2-3C, the Met Office said.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
