But Meghan was desperate for a child and thought the risk was worth it.\u2018I always dreamed of being a mum, so we took a risky decision to try and hoped it all turned out well,\u2019 explains Meghan.\u2018If not, we would be fighting the disease again.\u00a0If the surgeon had left one cancer cell in the body, the hormones could have caused it to spread.\u2019Meghan first discovered a lump when she was 25, but doctors dismissed it because she was so young and had no family history of cancer.When the lump continued to grow, she got a second opinion and following an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy, it was confirmed that she had breast cancer.\u2018When I was diagnosed it felt like my life was falling from under my feet,\u2019 says Meghan.\u2018I was told the bad news was that I had cancer, but the good that it could be treatable. Being diagnosed so young, you think you are going to die, but the reality is that there is a lot of science and tech that help many people survive.\u2019It was this positive attitude that led Meghan to her decision to push on with her pregnancy, despite the risks. When her baby girl was born, Meghan says it was a dream come true.\u2018As soon as they placed her onto me, my husband and I were crying. I say all the time that she is our little miracle baby. We never thought we would have a child naturally and so are blessed.\u2018We are so thankful, as a many people are not granted this opportunity, it definitely makes all the sleepless nights worth it.\u2019They named their daughter, Kendra Jane, after their oncologist, Dr. Jane Raymond. The couple say they are discussing the possibility of more kids in the future, if doctors say it\u2019s possible.\u2018We had three embryos and seven eggs frozen, as chemotherapy can take away fertility,\u2019 explains Meghan.\u2018The risk is that the ovaries can be so damaged that they can\u2019t carry a child.\u2018My oncologist doesn\u2019t believe that cancer should take away the option for a woman to become a mom, and from day one she encouraged me to follow my dreams.\u2018For me, ever since beginning my journey I didn\u2019t want cancer to take anything else away from me.\u2018I would rather try for a child or any other goal, than feel like my life is being stopped waiting in fear of the cancer returning.\u2019MORE: This is why exercise could help ease your PMSMORE: Woman tweets her journey from Northern Ireland to Liverpool to have an abortion after she was told her baby won\u2019t surviveMORE: Our bodies need metal \u2013 this is how to make sure you\u2019re getting enough"}
