That\u2019s nowhere near happening now, but it could happen.\u2019Kirkpatrick said that if Facebook stops being a virtual watercooler for friendly conversation, but a lair for trolls and misinformation \u2013 advertisers might find the service too dangerous to showcase washing tablets and shoes.Research earlier this summer suggested that young people are deserting Facebook.A survey from the reliable Pew Foundation found that the top website among kids aged between 13 and 17 is YouTube, which was used by 85% of the teens involved in the study.In second place was Instagram (72%) followed by Snapchat (79%).Just 51% of teens are on Facebook, suggesting young people are turning away from a social network which was once a pivotal part of adolescent life.\u2018The social media environment among teens is quite different from what it was just three years ago,\u2019 said research associate Monica Anderson, lead author of the report.Today, their habits revolve less around a single platform.At the same time we\u2019ve seen this shift, teens are more digitally connected than ever \u2013 nearly all teens have access to a smartphone, and more than four-in-ten say they are online on a near-constant basis.\u2019Smartphone use is now \u2018nearly universal\u2019 among teens with 95% owning or having access to a mobile. Some 45% reported being online \u2018almost constantly\u2019.The survey of 743 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 was conducted between March 7 and April 10 2018.Facebook may be backing on other services that it owns \u2013 such as Instagram \u2013 in case its \u2018main\u2019 service fails, analysts told Associated Press.Analyst eMarketer estimates that Instagram will bring in 16 percent of Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue this year and 25 percent by 2020.\u2018Advertisers love Instagram,\u2019 eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. \u2018It has the appeal of being a generally positive environment.\u2019Half of voters want Theresa May as prime minister - at least until after BrexitThree rushed to hospital after double shooting in London's latest violenceMum considers sterilisation after medics fail to warn about son's missing fingers"}
