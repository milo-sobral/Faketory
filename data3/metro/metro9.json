{"id": "Brexit is putting an already stressed NHS to its ultimate test, as it pushes out junior doctors like\u00a0me", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesI am a junior doctor from the European Union, and my Brexit story is being repeated across the length and breadth of the NHS workforce.I moved to the UK from Germany because some of the best academic institutions in the world are based here.I did not think that I would ever want to leave the UK, but Brexit has caused me and many others to consider it.Initially I was certain that EU students and professionals would be able to stay in this country without restrictions.Now, rather than striding with confidence into the years ahead, I am witnessing first-hand how the government has managed to create insecurity among healthcare professionals.I almost lost out on funding that the NHS promised to provide to UK and EU medical students for the last two years of our degree.My medical school could not have been more honest: \u2018We were all somewhat surprised that no communications had gone out to our EU students.\u2018I think part of the problem is that institutions like ours are still reeling from Brexit and struggling with the complete lack of information from the centre as to what is planned.\u2019Things do not appear to have changed since \u2013 a daunting prospect considering I will be graduating in a few months.British regulatory uncertainty continues to threaten the careers of people like me, who have come here to study.Authorities in Germany and Switzerland were not able to provide me with any information regarding mutual recognition of professional qualifications post-Brexit.It means that I may not, at the end of all of this, be able to practice medicine in the country where I was born.Many of the most specialised doctors in the NHS that I have come across \u2013 be they heart surgeons or paediatric cardiologists \u2013 were recruited from the EU.More widely, 5.6% of NHS staff are EU nationals.There are colleagues at all levels of seniority who have already ventured into alternative careers in management consultancy or start-ups, or who have simply gone abroad.One of my mentors recently left a senior clinical specialist and research position in the NHS to go back to Germany. According to her, the job offers were simply better and the risks of staying in the UK too high.Is this a stable immigration model for a country whose Brexiteers claim to be seeking to build a \u2018Global Britain\u2019?I wonder whether I should go back.My whole life is here, and the British system of training for doctors is well-organised. But over on the other side of the continent, my living costs would be lower, my salary higher and my training shorter.Going to the gym should never be about guiltWhole Foods shares the healthy food trends we'll all be fans of in 2019Having to admit that I can't cope with my daughter's cancer is the hardest thing I've doneBritain\u2019s healthcare sector is being perniciously, invisibly, and permanently reshaped by Brexit, which will put an already stressed NHS to its ultimate test.This country desperately needs more healthcare professionals but Brexit is only going to create a greater shortage, as thousands of doctors, nurses and allied professionals will think twice about a long-term future in the NHS and the UK.Junior doctors like me come to this country from the EU in order to help people.The World Medical Association pledge, to which doctors worldwide are held by, forbids us from allowing \u2018considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, nationality, political affiliation, race, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor to intervene between my duty and my patient\u2019.I believe that junior doctors like me deserve that same respect from the British public.Without prompt action, Britain could see a generation of junior doctors decimated by exclusionary immigration policies and the ramifications of a botched Brexit.So as long as we are being kept in the dark about our future, I am in line with a recent statement by the British Medical Association, advocating for a People\u2019s Vote.We can protect the NHS. We can avoid catastrophic consequences for patients and the health workforce.We can keep our doctors and nurses in this country.We can, and we should.MORE: NHS England is still withholding a drug that prevents HIV.
