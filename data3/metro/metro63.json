{"id": "Parents of albino black twins are sick of people asking if the kids are really\u00a0theirs", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesAlbinism is the condition where people or animals are born without pigmentation in their skin and hair. This usually results in having pale hair, eyes, and skin.For people of colour it can mean being visibly different to the rest of their families which can be a difficult experience to navigate.Nolan and Savannah Lewis are two-year-old black twins born with the condition who clearly look different from their parents.That has meant mum Christin and dad Russell have been subject to a torrent of hurtful comments ranging from whether the twins are really theirs, if they used a surrogate, and the most offensive \u2013 whether Christin had an affair.Christin, 37, a travel agent from New Jersey, USA, said: \u2018People think that I cheated on my husband to have white babies.\u2018An agent who was interested in the twins modelling said to my husband: \u201cDid you have the babies with a white woman?\u201d\u2018\u2018I want to make a public service announcement: we are faithful, we did not cheat on each other and we did not use surrogates.\u2018I carried these babies for nine months.\u2019As a result of their albinism \u2013 which affects only one in 18,000 Americans and is even rarer in twins \u2013 Nolan and Savannah both have rapid eye movement and are sensitive to sunlight.Christin covers the twins with sunblock every time they leave the house as well as ensuring they wear sunglasses whenever they go outside.The hurtful comments are made by well-intentioned people as well as \u2018rude strangers\u2019, Christin says, which has left the parents wanting to homeschool the youngsters.\u2018We probably won\u2019t put them in the system with regular children,\u2019 she said.\u2018We think that they are very sensitive and people do stare at them on the street.\u2018We want to shield them from that and let them know they are beautiful and can do anything they set their minds to.\u2019Though the parents are used to the unwanted attention, Nolan and Savannah are completely unaware.The couple is determined their children will love themselves just as they are.Dad Russell added: \u2018In the beginning, I felt afraid for them and I worried that they would be bullied.\u2018But even though they are just two years old, I have developed a tough skin already.\u2018People look at them and they can\u2019t believe they are black kids with white skin. But I shrug my shoulders.\u2018I think they are beautiful and I wouldn\u2019t change them in any way. I want them to embrace their differences, not shy away from them.\u2019MORE: Falling pregnant after the death of my son saved me from grief.
