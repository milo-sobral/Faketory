And quite rightly too, as you can see for yourself below:As for her rivals, we\u2019ve got renditions of Ariana Grande, Niall Horan and David Bowie, while Anthony Russell, 28, will be recreating the magic from his first audition in 2017 by performing Julia Michaels\u2019 Issues.And it appears Danny Tetley will be taking to the stage, following a wobbly few days which saw the 37-year-old pull out of rehearsals after falling ill at the worst possible moment.\u2018He was so unwell on Wednesday that bosses decided it was for the best that he went home,\u2019 a source told Daily Star.\u2018Right now his main focus is getting better, but with the live shows kicking off on Saturday, everything is up in the air as to if he\u2019s well enough to perform.\u2019Thankfully, he\u2019s currently pencilled in to belt out Mariah Carey\u2019s Hero.The X Factor live shows kick off tonight at 8.25pm on ITV.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: X Factor\u2019s Anthony Russell opens up on the drug battle which almost killed him: \u2018I\u2019d be dead without Louis Tomlinson\u2019MORE: Nile Rodgers reveals Niall Horan was Louis Tomlinson\u2019s first pick for X Factor\u2019s Judges\u2019 Houses: \u2018I only did it as a favour\u2019\n\n\n\n"}
