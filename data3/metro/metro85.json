Voyager 2\u2019s next encounter was with Neptune in August 1989. Both Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, will eventually leave our solar system and enter interstellar space.MORE: Sorry, you\u2019ve probably been saying the word Uranus wrong your whole lifeVoyager 2\u2019s images of the five largest moons around Uranus revealed complex surfaces indicative of varying geologic pasts. The cameras also detected 10 previously unseen moons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 11 rings of Uranus, opaque and a few kilometres wide each, are relatively young in space terms \u2013 not more than 600 million years old. They were probably formed by collisional fragmentation of several moons that once orbited the planet (Picture: BSIP/UIG Via Getty)Several instruments studied the ring system, uncovering the fine detail of the previously known rings and two newly detected rings.Voyager data showed that the planet\u2019s rate of rotation is 17 hours, 14 minutes.The spacecraft also found a Uranian magnetic field that is both large and unusual. In addition, the temperature of the equatorial region, which receives less sunlight over a Uranian year, is nevertheless about the same as that at the poles.\n"}
