She got to be a part of it, and I got to be a part of it.\u2019Ashleigh called Stetson \u2018our miracle baby,\u2019 with Bliss branding him \u2018perfect\u2026our little cowboy.\u2019The INVOcell technique used by the Coulters is around half the price of traditional IVF, with the Coulters spending $8,000.That is far less than the $15,000-$20,000 cost of the most commonly used form of IVF, involving lab incubators.Dr Kathy said she hopes her and Dr Kevin\u2019s efforts will \u2018open up new avenues, new choices for same sex parents.\u2019She also offered a response to those who claim such cutting-edge science is contrary to their religious beliefs, saying: \u2018I would respectfully disagree.\u2018I think that family, relationship, children is exactly everything that was meant to be in our world.\u2019"}
