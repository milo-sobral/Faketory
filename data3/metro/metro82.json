{"id": "Marvel reveals Infinity Stones origin which might hint at Avengers 4\u00a0plotline", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesWhile fans of the MCU will have a completely different view of how the Infinity Stones came to be in the movies, the Marvel comic series might have dropped a major clue as to how they\u2019ll function in Avengers 4.Turns out Celestials have a big part of the whole shebang, which may have more of a say on the plot of the upcoming MCU film.In the latest edition of the Infinity Wars (2018) comics, #5, by Gerry Duggan and Mike Deodato Jr, the origin was revealed after Loki wrestled the six (current) Infinity Stones from Gamora (both of them RIP in the MCU world\u2026well, for now).The God of Mischief then headed to the Quarry of the Gods to try and wield his new power, however *record rip* they have no such power at the bottom of the Quarry, it turned out.In the comic, it is there Loki comes across the Celestials (a race of powerful entities who\u2019ve popped\u00a0up now a couple of times, notably in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2) who, as it transpired, created the stones (also known as Soul or Infinity Gems) and are apparently actively creating more to \u2018release in multiple realities\u2019 to really eff things up.In the MCU, showrunners placed the Infinity Stones as a bunch of MacGuffins \u2013 as in plot-shapers \u2013 in various films, originating in Guardians of the Galaxy.Here Benecio del Toro, aka, the Collector, explained the stones were the \u2018remnants of six singularities that existed before the\u00a0Big Bang\u2019, then compressed into stones and scattered throughout the cosmos, landing in the laps of various characters in the MCU.Funky.Until Infinity War, they\u2019re just doing their own MacGuffin thing \u2013 but in the last instalment it\u2019s here we find out from Stephen Strange and Wong that each stone controls an essential aspect of existence \u2013 soul, mind, etc \u2013 and wasn\u2019t just placed in the universe for fun.How could this information, however tenuous, sure, possibly factor into the next instalment of this phase?Well, time travel has to be one of the major theories of the coming plot, as the Avengers are expected to travel back in time to collect the stones in order to undo the Mad Titan\u2019s finger-snap after Thanos clicked and wiped away half the population because that\u2019s the kind of guy he is.If they head back in time and catch up with some Celestials, will they hand over some secret and saucy saviours to help the heroes reverse what went down in Infinity War? Will they decide to do away with the stones they created? Who ruddy knows (apart from, like, the Russo brothers and everyone else who worked on the movie)!Stan Lee laid to rest in private funeral as public tribute confirmed to be in the worksMarvel fans reckon Avengers 4 trailer is imminent after comic prelude gets release dateAvengers 4 trailer to premiere after Ralph Breaks The Internet hits cinemas?Pundits are predicting that even though Thanos assembled that dreaded Infinity Gauntlet and wiped away half the Avengers crew, they\u2019ll come back all through the Quantum Realm.Which is, of course, the main device punters believe the gang will use to orchestrate said time travel.It\u2019s all very convoluted and complicated but all will be made clear in no time \u2013 until then, guess we\u2019ll just keep those theories coming.Avengers 4 is in cinemas 26 April, 2019.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Deadpool creator teases image of John Cena as Captain America after wrestler hints at roleMORE: Joe Russo hints that Avengers 4 trailer could reach us even later than anticipated and we are heartbroken\n\n\n\n"}
