One is the drugs, two is this one-upmanship, this status thing, where you\u2019re known by your mates for stabbing people.\u2019More: Good Morning Britain\n\nKanye West wants a military plane for his new office\nPiers Morgan bites back at \u2018feminist nonsense\u2019 claims we should ditch the word \u2018gentleman\u2019\nPiers Morgan fires back at hate after saying Brexit 'won\u2019t be as grim as two world wars'Kanye West wants a military plane for his new officePiers Morgan bites back at \u2018feminist nonsense\u2019 claims we should ditch the word \u2018gentleman\u2019Piers Morgan fires back at hate after saying Brexit 'won\u2019t be as grim as two world wars'Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV1. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGot a showbiz story?\t\t\t\n\nIf you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\n\nIf you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Couple have weed-themed wedding with canna-cake, pot bouquets, and a budtenderMORE: Thousands denied medical cannabis as new law branded \u2018cruel and botched\u2019\n\n\n\n"}
