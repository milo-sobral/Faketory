{"id": "Having to admit that I can\u2019t cope with my daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever\u00a0done", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesThere\u2019s a tradition among young cancer patients that sees them ringing a special bell at the end of their treatment.When that gong sounds, everyone in the ward knows that another little boy or girl has finally had their last gruelling session of chemo or radiotherapy.Last month, at a clinic in Germany, it was the turn of my five year old daughter, Amelia, who was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour earlier this year.Except \u2013 true to form \u2013 Amelia didn\u2019t want to ring her bell. If anything, she looked scared of it.And as her mum, I\u00a0was terrified too.Yes, that bell\u00a0marked the end of Amelia\u2019s treatment, but what that bell\u00a0also signified is that we now have to wait until January for a\u00a0follow-up MRI scan, which will tell us if Amelia\u2019s cancer has been\u00a0kept at bay.Our journey is,\u00a0then, only just beginning. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for lots of\u00a0other families in our position.In the meantime\u00a0we, as a family unit, have to find a new way of living, establishing\u00a0new \u2018normal\u2019 routines. We always with one eye on what comes next, despite the fact that our lives have pretty much been exploded and\u00a0then crudely pieced back together again.Our nightmare began in June this year,\u00a0when Amelia suffered a seizure at school.You don\u2019t naturally assume the worst.\u00a0I remember thinking, \u2018perhaps she overheated, or she might have\u00a0epilepsy?\u2019But Amelia didn\u2019t have epilepsy. She\u00a0actually had a \u2018neuroepithelial\u2019 tumour measuring 2cm in the\u00a0upper part of her brain \u2013 one of only 30 known cases in Europe.She underwent a seven hour operation at\u00a0Leeds General Infirmary to successfully remove it, amazing everyone\u00a0with her courage and energy despite her extended stays in hospital.And seven weeks ago we flew to Essen,\u00a0Germany, for Amelia to have something called proton beam therapy \u2013 a\u00a0less damaging form of radiotherapy \u2013 to try and make sure her cancer\u00a0doesn\u2019t come back.We\u2019re not alone in having this\u00a0treatment. A recent Freedom of Information request undertaken by the\u00a0Proton Therapy Center in Prague \u2013 another clinic who take patients\u00a0from the UK \u2013 revealed how the NHS has approved 737 people to travel\u00a0abroad for proton\u00a0treatment since 2008, with almost three quarters of\u00a0those being children.In Germany, there was an odd sense of\u00a0detachment from the situation. We surrendered ourselves to the\u00a0routine of treatment and put our faith in the healthcare\u00a0professionals.But, the closer it came to coming home,\u00a0the more reality started to creep back in.I had to go back to work to make sure\u00a0we had money coming in, and I knew Amelia would have to start returning\u00a0to school \u2013 something she\u2019s beyond excited about.Yet how on earth would we just pick up\u00a0our lives where we left off and continue as before?It didn\u2019t help that when returned to\u00a0the UK, it felt like events were conspiring against us.My washing machine broke down, my\u00a0boiler broke down, my car broke down \u2013 things that just thrust us\u00a0back into mundane, everyday life.What\u2019s more, the situation has been\u00a0particularly hard on my son, Amelia\u2019s 11-year-old big brother Lewis.He\u2019s always been quite slow to process\u00a0information, and he\u2019s always had a bit of a nervous tick, too.Going to the gym should never be about guiltWeightlifting protects against heart disease better than running or cyclingWoman says she can now leave the house thanks to CBD oil clearing her eczemaBut since we\u2019ve been away, his tick has\u00a0got much worse. I got him to the doctors, who said, \u2018Let\u2019s get him\u00a0for an MRI, just to check everything out.\u2019So now, on top of Amelia\u2019s MRI scan in\u00a0January, my son Lewis will also have one, as I worry that he might\u00a0have a brain tumour, too.The doctors say it\u2019s unlikely \u2013 his\u00a0tick has probably just been exacerbated from the stress and anxiety\u00a0caused by Amelia\u2019s diagnosis \u2013 but it\u2019s heaped on extra pressure,\u00a0that\u2019s for sure.Now it\u2019s a case of admitting that I\u00a0can\u2019t do this on my own. I\u2019ve had to fight off my natural instinct\u00a0to withdraw into myself.I need help from family and I need support\u00a0from the charities who are always there and offer invaluable assistance.I\u2019d\u00a0urge anyone in our position to do the same \u2013 because if you are affected, chances are you can\u2019t do this on your own, either.We all need to reach out for help, even if it\u2019s just someone to listen at the end of the phone.There are people out there who know what you\u2019re going through, and life goes on \u2013 especially for a child fighting cancer.Vicky\u2019s blog can be found here.MORE: Cancer survivor who risked disease returning to try for a baby has had a little girlMORE: Cancer treatments ravage your skin \u2013 these products are designed to helpMORE: New approach to anal cancer is \u2018safer and more effective\u2019"}
