I can\u2019t really talk about that scene, but I knew it took them three months in planning this scene to have everyone there.\u2018You look around and you just saw everyone from Samuel L. Jackson to Michael Douglas to Michelle Pfeiffer. Everybody was there.\u2019Hmmm\u2026 why would they all be filming a scene together if they weren\u2019t resurrected?Sebastian later played down the spoileriffic content, telling Entertainment Tonight: \u2018I don\u2019t think I revealed anything crazy. Everyone\u2019s going to be in this movie.\u2018Nobody crazy, that I mentioned, would not be in this film. Michael Douglas could come in and pour a tea for one scene, for all you know.\u2019Of course, that was before we knew Pym had perished in the Thanos snap.Stan Lee laid to rest in private funeral as public tribute confirmed to be in the worksMarvel fans reckon Avengers 4 trailer is imminent after comic prelude gets release dateAvengers 4 trailer to premiere after Ralph Breaks The Internet hits cinemas?This adds more weight to the theory that the Thanos snap will be reversed with a bit of help from the Quantum Realm.Michael Douglas confirmed that this would be \u2018the key\u2019 to Avengers 4, saying: \u2018The Quantum Realm plays an important part in all the next chapters, I think, of the Marvel films.\u2019And it has been rumoured a scene in Thor: The Dark World, where the Soul Forge is discussed, could spell out how our heroes are brought back to life.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: The trailer for Will Smith\u2019s Spies In Disguise contains the greatest plot twist in movie historyMORE: Why MCM Comic Con is always worth going to \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\n\n\n"}
