A very solid foundation of love and respect that allowed them to be so open and pragmatic but I think we could learn a lot from that,\u2019 she said.Meanwhile, Rami Malek \u2013 who gave an incredible performance as the iconic musician \u2013 previously admitted that he felt \u2018terrified\u2019 playing Freddie in the film.Miranda Sings freaks out at first glimpse of herself in Wreck It Ralph 2Will Smith is 'terrified' to follow Robin Williams' performance as Genie in AladdinAlternate Thor plotline would have wiped Peter Dinklage from Avengers: Infinity WarHe confessed: \u2018Every part of me was terrified. But then, what are you going to do? It\u2019s an opportunity of a lifetime. I couldn\u2019t pass it up.\u2019Despite the pressure, Rami was determined to ensure that his on-screen performance was as natural as possible.The actor actually made a conscious decision not to imitate the Queen star, who died in 1991 from bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.He said: \u2018I was very cognisant of not wanting to imitate him or impersonate him at all.\u2018I started to think about how everything he did was spontaneous, in the moment. He is someone who lived every moment as if it was his last, I feel.\u2019If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: X Factor\u2019s Simon Cowell to get famous neighbour as he \u2018buys \u00a315million house near Pope Francis\u2019MORE: Strictly\u2019s Anton Du Beke literally shouts at judges for \u2018under marking\u2019 Kate Silverton for her Rumba\n\n\n\n"}
