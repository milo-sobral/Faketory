That was deceitful, calculated and manipulative.\u2018You took the coward\u2019s way out, kept your silence and infected them. You had no right to do so.\u2018You bore an overwhelming responsibility for your own selfish actions which have left such devastation in your wake.\u2019Judge Parry also imposed a sexual harm prevention order on Sutcliffe which \u2013 until further notice \u2013 prohibits him from engaging in lawful sex with another person unless he has told them he has HIV and they understood and acknowledged the disclosure.Sutcliffe was previously subject to an order\u00a0which required him to provide contact details of partners to Lancashire Police\u2019s public protection unit and then wait for written approval before having intercourse wearing a condom.The man was diagnosed with HIV in 2008 but the offences took place\u00a0on various dates between 2009 and 2016.The court heard how\u00a0Sutcliffe had \u2018ample opportunity\u2019 to tell both partners of his status.But the judge said he left one with a \u2018life sentence\u2019.Sutcliffe\u2019s second victim contracted the virus after he complained he was struggling to put a condom on. She told the court that Sutcliffe had robbed her of \u2018precious early months of bonding\u2019 with her child as she took to wearing gloves to feed and change the infant.The court heard Sutcliffe\u00a0was said to have a background of alcohol and drug abuse, and had been referred to mental health services on numerous occasions.Detective Constable Emma Shuttleworth, of Lancashire Police, said: \u2018Aaron Sutcliffe had numerous opportunities to tell both of his victims that he was HIV positive and he failed to do so.\u2018His intention may not have been to harm but he has been as reckless as it is possible to be and he has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the health of these two women, whose lives and the lives of their families have been changed irrevocably through his actions.\u2019Prison nurse exchanged almost 8,000 calls and texts with jailed sex offenderOne killed and 106 injured in violent French riots over fuel taxesRapist transgender woman sent to male prison for UK's most dangerous menKat Smithson, director of policy and campaigns at NAT, the National Aids Trust, said most people living with HIV in the UK were on effective treatment and the virus was \u2018much more commonly acquired from someone who is unaware of their status\u2019.\u2018It is saddening and concerning to hear statements to the effect that individuals have experienced worries that they may pass HIV on to their children \u2013 we want to be very clear that there is no risk of passing HIV on through day to day contact like this and we hope to reassure anyone recently diagnosed of this.\u2019\u2018Hundreds of women living with HIV every year give birth to and raise children who are HIV negative.\u2019If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
