Bonnie has completed our family.\u2019Noel, 46, added: \u2018Some people decide to stop after two or three kids. We\u2019ve made it after 21.\u2019Bonnie, who was born weighing 8lb 4oz on Tuesday, is already settling in well to life at their 10-bed house in Morecambe, Lancashire.Their other children are thrilled to have another sister, who is three decades younger than oldest sibling Chris, now 29.Sue continued: \u2018They were all fighting over the first cuddle. It\u2019s such a lovely moment when you bring a newborn home and the others are all lined up ready to hold her.\u2019The couple support themselves with their bakery and only claim child credit. Many of the children also help out in the bakery and the early starts mean that Noel can be home to help with the school run \u2013 in their own bus.Noel had a vasectomy after baby number nine but it was later reversed. The couple have told friends and family they are done, although they also made that vow after Archie, now 14 months, was born.Sue has spent over 800 weeks pregnant and said: \u2018It has to come to an end at some point.\u2018The maternity clothes will be going in the bin shortly.
