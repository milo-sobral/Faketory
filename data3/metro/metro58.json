It\u2019s a great episode, drawing on their history and bringing all those things together. One of the things I love in Coronation Street is how it draws on its own history, in this case the history of Ken being a bad father.\u2018I love it when we\u2019re working in the Barlows, I\u2019m very fond of them all in real life, I\u2019m really enjoying having a full house again. A few years ago there was just Ken, Tracy and Amy. Now there\u2019s Tracy, Amy, Daniel, Adam, Peter, Simon, Steve and Sinead as well, there are so many stories to tell.\u2019Coronation Street airs this special episode on Monday 29th October at 8:30pm on ITV.\u00a0MORE: 25 soap spoilers: Emmerdale murder shock, Coronation Street death trauma, EastEnders baby twist, Hollyoaks fightMORE: Coronation Street spoilers: Another new Roy Cropper and Evelyn Plummer twist after dogging arrest\n\n\n\n"}
