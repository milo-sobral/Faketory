They were quickly told to leave.\u2018It\u2019s like a city,\u2019 BBC reporter John Sudworth says.\u2018If this really is all about education then why the effort to stop us getting close?\u2019China has characterized its mass internment of Muslims as a push to bring into the \u2018modern, civilized\u2019 world a \u2018destitute people\u2019 who are \u2018easily led astray\u2019 \u2013 a depiction that analysts said bore troubling colonial overtones.The ruling Communist Party released a report on Tuesday last week to defend the detention of Central Asian Muslim minorities \u2013 including Uighur and Kasakh Muslims \u2013 without trial.According to estimates made by the UN, around 1,000,000 people have been arbitrarily detained in mass internment camps.Former detainees have described being tortured, forced to drop their Islamic beliefs and have had their children taken away and placed in orphanages.The government says they are trying to bring \u2018indigenous Central Asian ethnic minorities into Han Chinese society and in turn, a \u201cmodern\u201d lifestyle\u2019, the official Xinhua News Agency claimed.Xinjiang Governor Shohrat Zakir said authorities were providing people with lessons on Mandarin, Chinese history and laws, hoping to \u2018steer them away from extremism\u2019.China says the camps \u2013 or \u2018education centres\u2019 \u2013 are necessary for countering the threat of terrorism, despite growing alarm from the US and the United Nations.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
