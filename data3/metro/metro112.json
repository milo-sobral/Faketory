Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 3, 2018To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrowser that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupports HTML5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvideoThe Boring Company has already built a test tunnel near the SpaceX HQ in Hawthorne, California, which Musk says will have an opening party in December that means pedestrians and cyclists can try it out.\u2018To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels,\u2019 explains the Boring Company in its FAQ.\u2018Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won\u2019t fall on your head. A large network of tunnels many levels deep would fix congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew (just keep adding levels).\u2018The key to making this work is increasing tunnelling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more \u2013 this is the goal of The Boring Company\u2019."}
