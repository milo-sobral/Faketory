According to Metronews media, 223 fines were handed out in 2015 for wearing a full veil in public.Other countries in Europe have introduced legislation on Islamic dress. Denmark\u2019s parliament enacted a ban on wearing of face veils in public in May.Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have also imposed some restrictions on full-face veils in public places.France has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million or more out of a population of 67 million. The place of religion and religious symbols worn in public can be a matter of controversy in the staunchly secular country.The UN Human Rights Committee came to similar conclusions on the 2008 case of a woman sacked by a creche for wearing a veil.In September, a top French judge was quoted by newspaper Le Monde as saying that while not binding, the panel\u2019s decisions might still influence French case law."}
