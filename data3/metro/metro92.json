Irregular and unpredictable periods can be unpleasant and an inconvenience. If a woman doesn\u2019t want to conceive, she may be prescribed a low dose combined oral contraceptive pill. If ovulation occurs erratically, it may take longer than average for a woman to become pregnant.\u2018There are a number of treatment options available to stimulate regular ovulation including taking clomifene tablets, which encourages the monthly release of an egg from the ovaries. If medication isn\u2019t successful, women may be offered hormone injections.\u2018Women who are overweight have a reduced chance of conception and are at increased risk of miscarriage and other pregnancy-related complications. They are encouraged to lose weight before trying to conceive, whether naturally or through fertility treatment. To actively maintain a healthy body weight, women are advised to eat a well-balanced, healthy diet and take part in regular exercise.\u2019Though there\u2019s no cure for PCOS, there are treatments you can try to help and some women with the condition, have been able to get pregnant completely naturally.Mum\u00a0Tarryn Poulton, founder of\u00a0PCOS Diet Support, was able to conceive naturally after being diagnosed ten years ago.She told Metro.co.uk how diet is a big part of the solution. \u2018Many women are diagnosed with PCOS when they first start trying to conceive,\u2019 she said. \u2018The birth control pill masks many of the symptoms and when women with PCOS stop taking the pill, the symptoms of PCOS come to light.\u2018This was the case with me. When I was diagnosed with PCOS over 10 years ago, my doctor was very unhelpful. Her suggestion was to either go back on the pill (which is not an option when you are trying to conceive) or to be referred to a fertility clinic.\u2018Difficulties regulating insulin are part and parcel of PCOS. If women with PCOS are able to manage those insulin levels, they are more likely to see improvements in their androgens (a type of hormone) and levels of inflammation, which in turn improves ovulation and boosts fertility.\u2019There are other options available such as IVF, which may be used by couples if the egg and sperm struggle to meet.\u00a0While IVF has been used by many couples successfully to conceive, it can still be expensive if you don\u2019t fall under the criteria to get it for free on the NHS.Other options include\u00a0using ovulation drugs or injections which contain hormones that stimulate the ovaries to release one or more eggs. These drugs, when used with a healthy diet, weight, and exercise, can help you conceive.Fertility drugs can be taken together with metformin which helps to lower insulin levels and leads to more regular menstruation and ovulation cycles allowing women to get pregnant.According to the NHS, If you\u2019re unable to get pregnant despite taking oral medications, a different type of medication called\u00a0gonadotrophins may be recommended. These are given by injection and there\u2019s a higher risk that they may overstimulate\u00a0your ovaries and lead to multiple pregnancies.An alternative to this is a surgical procedure called ovarian drilling. This keyhole surgery can be equally effective but doesn\u2019t increase your risk of multiple pregnancies.However, the effects of the procedure may only last a few months and it\u00a0carries the risk of developing scar tissue between the fallopian tubes and ovary.It\u2019s likely that a fertility specialist will check that your fallopian tubes aren\u2019t blocked before most of these treatments are\u00a0used.Going to the gym should never be about guiltHaving to admit that I can't cope with my daughter's cancer is the hardest thing I've doneWeightlifting protects against heart disease better than running or cyclingIf you have PCOS and you do become pregnant, you have a higher risk of complications, such as\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension),\u00a0pre-eclampsia,\u00a0gestational diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0miscarriage. These risks are particularly high if you\u2019re\u00a0obese.If you\u2019re overweight or obese, you can lower your risk by\u00a0losing weight\u00a0before\u00a0trying\u00a0for a baby.If you have PCOS and want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor and assess each option to see what\u2019s best for you.MORE: Pregnant mum says she was fat shamed by her midwife despite being size 12MORE: Woman ditches her secret shaving routine to grow a beard like her husbandMORE: Male fertility stories: I had lazy sperm and no one to talk to about it"}
