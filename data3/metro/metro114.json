It\u2019s absolutely devastating.\u2019Lloyd Ellington, a minister at the Church of God of Prophesy in Wembley, now an assistant pastor, was also at the gross incompetence hearing today.He said: \u2018The first time I met Peri was when he knocked on the church door looking for a place to rest his feet.\u2018He was very proud, he said \u201cI don\u2019t want any money, I just want to rest my feet for a while\u201d.\u2018He didn\u2019t wear shoes because of his condition and his bandages were soaking wet, he was in a bad state.\u2019Lloyd gave him shelter for the night and took him under his wing after that.He worked tirelessly to get him into accommodation with Hillingdon Council but couldn\u2019t because Peri had originally lived in Enfield.At the time councils would only house local people.Woman kicked out after telling family she's a lesbian says football saved her lifeMeghan's not the only royal who can cook as Will and Kate make soup for charityYour old and forgotten coat can keep the homeless warm this winterBefore Peri died Lloyd had contacted his sons in Greece to see if they would meet him when he got home.Lloyd said: \u2018The worst thing is they got back to me a few weeks after he died and said that would be great.\u2018One of his sons said he was living on his own and Peri could live with him.\u2018Peri was a gentleman, this is why all of this is so hard to take.
