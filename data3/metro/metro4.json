In Sweden we do not have the death penalty, but deportation to a country at war can mean death.\u2018If someone has committed a crime, they may be jailed and serve their sentence in Sweden.\u2019But now Swedish prosecutors have said Elin will be prosecuted at Gothenburg district court \u2018for crimes against the aviation law\u2019 following the incident.They claim she\u00a0had not complied with the captain\u2019s request and had refused to sit down despite repeated requests from the crew.She faces a fine and up to six months in jail.Gudrun Romeborn, from the group Sittstrejken (Sitdown Strike) which Elin is active in, told The Guardian: \u2018Elin\u2019s bravery has inspired a lot of people. But it is important to understand why so many people in the community are working for justice for asylum seekers in Sweden.\u2018They are not criminals. We are trying to stop deportations to save lives. Europe gives a lot of money to create security in Afghanistan, but it is not working.\u2019No date has yet been set for the trial.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
