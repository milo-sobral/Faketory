Doesn\u2019t she understand the cruelty inflicted on these poor elephants in order for her inane photo shoot.\u2019Kim was also blasted online for the images, which saw her climb on the animal wearing a bikini during her holiday.Someone needs to educate #KimKardashian or she just doesn't give a F**k\ud83d\ude21 Baby Elephants are abused and tortured so stupid Tourist can ride them #Phajaan #ElephantCrush #Bullhook #DontBuyATicket \ud83c\udfab  #DontRideElephants \ud83d\udc18@KimKardashian pic.twitter.com/QWLwd1PyA8\u2014 \ud83c\udfb8TeamZay\ud83c\udfb8 (@zay_team) November 3, 2018Shame on you Kim. Elephants are stolen from their mothers and go through a torturous breaking in ritual to get them to become docile to carry people. They are threatened and beaten all the lives in captivity just so people can ride them for a few minutes. Educate yourself please.\u2014 MrsMapother (@MrsMapother) November 4, 2018It sure beats shooting them. Maybe she can bring awareness to preserving these endangered gifts. Please @KimKardashian #help #elephants and #rhinos! https://t.co/O8k4aK7a9m\u2014 Marilyn Schlitz, PhD (@MarilynSchlitz) November 4, 2018Kim was also slammed by Peta, who told Metro.co.uk: \u2018All over the world, tourist traps offer the chance to climb onto an elephant\u2019s back without divulging to the visitors what these animals endure in order to force them to allow this. Baby elephants\u2019 spirits are broken through an egregiously cruel process in which still-nursing elephants are dragged away from their mothers, immobilised, and gouged with bullhooks and nails.\u2018These horrific, ritualised training sessions often leave elephants severely injured and traumatised, and some don\u2019t survive. Riding elephants or visiting camps that force elephants to come into contact with humans directly supports this abuse.\u2019However, the star has since responded to criticisms to say she had researched the sanctuary before visiting.She wrote:\u00a0\u2018We visited an elephant sanctuary that has rescued these elephants from Sumatra where they would have otherwise gone extinct. It is an organisation that is working to save these beautiful animals. We did full research before going.\u2019Animal rights charities have been campaigning for the practice of elephant riding to be banned, with sanctuaries being created for elephants and their trainers to retire to.Many travel sites, including TripAdvisor and Intrepid Travel, have dropped selling tickets to tourists for wildlife experiences where they come into contact with wild animals. With the practice of riding of elephants, calves are often taken from their mothers and can be trained with sharp hooks, kept on chains, and \u2018broken\u2019 so that these hugely strong, wild animals will obey human command.However, it\u2019s perhaps important to note that Kim is pictured climbing onto the elephant without the seat on its back, which are often incredibly heavy and very painful for the animals, with the contraptions often rubbing and digging into their skin.The 38-year-old was in Bali on holiday with her sisters where she was also filming Keeping Up With The Kardashians. After visiting the elephant sanctuary she is said to have returned to filming, along with son Saint and daughter North. Her husband Kanye West is said to have stayed home and missed the trip.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Zayn Malik shades record label for \u2018holding back\u2019 new musicMORE: Ariana Grande references Pete Davidson and \u2018angel\u2019 Mac Miller in new single Thank U, Next as singer reveals she\u2019s moved on\n\n\n\n"}
