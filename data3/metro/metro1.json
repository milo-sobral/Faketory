These types of bone, especially mammoth tusk, can deteriorate quite poorly if left untreated so great care should be taken with these remains.\u2019The \u00a31.5billion A14 project is due to open in December 2020.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
