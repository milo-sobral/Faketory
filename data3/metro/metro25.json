{"id": "Two unborn babies undergo spinal surgery while still in the\u00a0womb", "paragraph": "135.6m sharesWeeks before they even took their first breaths, two babies underwent spinal surgery while still in the womb.Doctors discovered the babies both had spina bifida, which is usually treated after birth, but research shows that treating it earlier can prevent health issues after birth \u2013 including brain fluid loss and long-term mobility issues.In the first operations of their kind in the UK, a team of 30 doctors and surgeons at London\u2019s University College Hospital operated on unborn babies in their mothers\u2019 wombs.UCL\u2019s Professor Anne David, who has been working for three years to bring the procedure to patients in the UK, led the operations and said British mothers have in the past had to travel to the US or Europe for the procedure.\u2018It\u2019s fantastic. Women now don\u2019t have to travel out of the UK,\u2019 Professor David said.\u2018They can have their family with them. There are less expenses. So all good things.\u2019The surgery team from UCLH and the Great Ormond Street Hospital previously travelled to Belgium to train at a facility in Leuven, where more than 40 such operations have been carried out.Spina bifida is a condition that develops during pregnancy when the bones of the spine do not form properly, creating a gap that leaves the spinal cord unprotected.It can cause a baby\u2019s spinal fluid to leak and put brain development at risk, potentially leading to long-term health and mobility problems.More than 200 children are born with spina bifida every year in the UK, according to charity Shine.A study in the US found the groundbreaking pre-birth surgery did have health and mobility benefits for babies known to have spina bifida, with a 50% reduction in people needing to have shunts inserted in the brain to drain fluid \u2013 a\u00a0procedure that carries long-term complications on brain and motor functioning, researchers said.Children in the US study were also more independent after the surgery, Professor David said.\u2018There were some children who had grown up following foetal surgery who were walking and you wouldn\u2019t expect them to be walking if they hadn\u2019t had it,\u2019 she said.\u2018So it\u2019s important to be able to offer the surgery to patients here in the UK.\u2019Surgeons make an incision in the womb in a precise location to access the baby\u2019s spine.They then stitch closed the gap caused by spina bifida.The surgery, which takes some 90 minutes, carries a risk of premature labour but less invasive keyhole methods are being explored.\u2018We put the mum on some drugs that help relax them, but there is still a risk,\u2019 Professor David said.\nShe said a \u2018foetoscopic\u2019 approach is being developed with the hope this will further minimise maternal complications.The surgeries will be available for suitable patients through the newly established Centre for Prenatal Therapy at UCLH and GOSH, made possible by funding of \u00a3450,000 from the hospitals\u2019 charities.\u2018These vital funds have provided training for the surgical team and will fund surgery for the first 10 patients,\u2019 UCLH\u2019s clinical director for women\u2019s health Professor Donald Peebles said.Frankie Lavis, from Plymouth, became the first British baby to undergo the revolutionary surgery in Belgium in 2013.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
