When the nurses gave him back he was screaming.\u2018They had him on morphine and his face was swollen and bruised and bloody.\u2018It was like we had been given back a different baby.\u2018He cried the whole day. We had to feed him with a syringe after the operation.\u2018I hated knowing that something we had chosen, the operation, had caused so much pain for our son.\u2019But a few days after the operation, as the swelling went down and the bruising healed, the worried parents were rewarded by seeing Cam smile for the first time with his full upper lip.Matt said: \u2018Sara was changing his diaper and I was watching TV. She started screaming: \u201cCome in here, he\u2019s smiling!\u201d\u2018I rushed in. I couldn\u2019t believe it. In my darkest moments, I thought I\u2019d never see him smile with a healed top lip but here he was beaming at me.\u2018It was a full face smile. He was giving the biggest grin he could.\u2018Sara and I cried because we were beginning to think we\u2019d never see him smile.\u2018The beam was in his eyes and in his cheeks. He was saying: \u201cI\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still the same baby, everything\u2019s OK.\u201d\u2018Although some ultrasounds can pick up a cleft palate before birth, Cam\u2019s remained undetected.But Matt said that as soon as he was born, he and Sara, a dental assistant, knew something was wrong.He said: \u2018No one said anything at first. I went over to see Cam and the nurses were all huddled together.\u2018I had never seen anything like his face before. I had no idea what I was looking at.\u2018A nurse told me he had a cleft lip and palate and that they needed to work out how he was going to eat and breathe.\u2019After a few days on the neonatal intensive care unit, Cam was able to go home with his parents and brother.Cam had to be fitted with a mouthpiece, known as a NAM device, which covered the roof of his mouth to stretch out the area in preparation for the first operation.But although it was necessary, the device was painful for little Cam, and Matt said he and Sara would wonder if they were doing the right thing.Although the first operation has been a success, Cam faces a further two to fully heal his cleft palate.The second, which will happen when he is 18 months old, will repair the roof of his mouth.The final procedure, which will happen between the age of four and seven, will rebuild his gums with a bone graft.Matt and Sara now want to give hope to other parents who are struggling with a baby with a cleft palate.He said: \u2018It is terrifying but the scariest part is before you go and talk to surgeons.\u2018Once you get your doctor and a solid team in place, it gets a lot less scary.\u2018You fall in love with your baby and it doesn\u2019t matter whether they have a cleft palate or not.\u2019If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
