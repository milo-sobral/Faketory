I am happy where we had settled.\u2019Anthony added: \u2018[Thor] really goes on kind of a like a classic hero\u2019s journey. We wanted to create the feeling in the film that Thor was actually going to save the day.Avengers star Chris Hemsworth says farewell to India after filming 'intense' scenesFan theory suggests Doctor Strange survived Thanos\u2019 snap in Infinity WarMarvel fans reckon Avengers 4 trailer is imminent after comic prelude gets release dateSo, him going to get this weapon that could kill Thanos was a critical part of the story and we had to give a lot of screen time and a lot of strong dramatic interest because we really wanted people invested in that \u2013 so that they would be coming into the climax of the film with that feeling.\u2019We\u2019re happy with what they chose too \u2013 and not only because a different path would have starved us of prime Peter Dinklage screentime.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Avengers star Chris Hemsworth says farewell to India after filming \u2018most intense and exciting action sequences ever done\u2019MORE: The Walking Dead\u2019s Daryl has replaced Rick Grimes with a dog and he\u2019s awesome\n\n\n\n"}
