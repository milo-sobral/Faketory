They have been living in destitution now for the last four years.\u2018People have been dying for years and so little has been done. It is shameful.\u2018If we miss this opportunity when there is momentum, then it could be a disaster for the people of Yemen, which brings worrying implications for the whole region.\u2019Yemen has been at war since March 2015, when the Iranian-backed Houthi group occupied northern Yemen, forcing the government into exile.Since then a Saudi-led coalition supporting the Yemen government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign with an average of one strike every 90 minutes.Experts say there have been war crimes happening on both sides.Saudi Arabia has come under heavy criticism in recent months, with experts saying some 49% of air strikes have hit non-military targets.Other tactics include the bombing of a bus carrying school children, and another attack that targeted a wedding.The Houthi group have been accused of using hi-tech missiles and using civilians as human shields.Yesterday the UN warned of an \u2018imminent catastrophe\u2019 saying 14,000,000 are at risk of starvation in the coming months \u2013 half of the population.Around 56,000 civilians have been killed or injured in the proxy war and there have been over one million cases of cholera.Food prices are soaring and the war is preventing a lot of aid and international imports from reaching besieged areas, especially around the key port of Hodeida.Mr Skinner continued: \u2018It is just desperate. This could be the biggest famine since Ethiopia in the 1980s.\u2018We always think \u201cnot again\u201d but this isn\u2019t about rain fall or drought or crop failure.\u2018This is a man-made crisis and it was preventable.\u2019In the wake of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, there is now real pressure on the Saudis to pause their war efforts in Yemen.The US called for both sides to end the war with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis calling for negotiations to begin within 30 days.Theresa May has backed the calls and is now under pressure to end British arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which are worth billions each year to the UK arms industry.Earlier this year Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK Government to buy 48 jets in a major deal.Other Saudi allies, such as France and the US, are also still selling weapons with only Germany stopping its trade.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to end Saudi arms deals if he is elected.IRC said the international community needed to recognise that the Houthi group would be part of the future of Yemen.Mr Skinner added: \u2018We need a pause in this conflict. It\u2019s shameful that the situation has been allowed to deteriorate so far and there hasn\u2019t been a greater diplomatic effort to solve the crisis.\u2018The UK and US have influence with one of the warring parties but up until now they haven\u2019t used it.\u2019He added that \u2018before the UK and US turned a blind eye and didn\u2019t scrutinise the Saudis\u2019 but after the murder of Mr\u00a0Khashoggi, they can no longer do that.Mr Skinner continued: \u2018The UK is a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and we want them to pause the sale of arms.\u2018It won\u2019t stop the conflict but it could influence the Saudis.\u2019He added that Germany and Brussels had some power to get the Iranian-backed Houthi group to the negotiating table.If you have a story for our news team, email us at webnews@metro.co.uk.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter."}
