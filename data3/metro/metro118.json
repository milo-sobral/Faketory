It\u2019s much more powerful than me, doesn\u2019t speak the same language and it runs around in the darkness of my soul.\u2018I would sell my mother for a rock of crack.\u2019Jessie J hasn't given up on hopes of becoming a mother naturally after refusing a hysterecJustin Bieber finally settles lawsuit for egging neighbour's houseJessica Chastain and husband Gian Luca 'welcome their first child by surrogate'Now, he\u2019s focused on work. He told the Daily Mirror: \u2018I love what I do, but it\u2019s driven by a fear of not being able to do it.\u2019Hardy was honoured alongside Kenny Dalglish, Jermain Defoe and Jo Malone.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2019s James McVey reveals why he split from Games of Thrones\u2019 Sophie TurnerMORE: Jack Black reunites with School Of Rock drummer, now 29, and makes us all feel ancient\n\n\n\n"}
