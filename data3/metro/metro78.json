It\u2019s already the law not to serve people who are already drunk, just enforce that.\u2018Don\u2019t ruin the fun for everyone else.\u2019Richard, 62, then played devil\u2019s advocate, saying: \u2018Very often there\u2019s a gap before the last drink at the bar and getting to the plane, and that last drink tipping you over. By the time you get to the plane it\u2019s kicking in.\u2019Kerry added: \u2018It takes 20 minutes to get from the bar to the gate anyway, I think it\u2019s down to ground staff. What are they doing anyway? They need to do something.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just the Whole Again songstress who weighed in on the debate though, as GMB fans at home also got involved on Twitter.One person suggested: \u2018Instead of restricting times, limit the amount they can serve people. Only serve two pints per person. Easy to monitor, cause I enjoy a drink before I fly at whatever time it is.\u2019\u2018Issue two tickets with boarding pass name on them and you have to show your passport with it like you do when buying in duty free you need ya boarding pass,\u2019 another agreed.A third slammed: \u2018 I totally agree to ban before 10am. Just because it\u2019s the start of your holiday doesn\u2019t mean you need to drink at stupid times in the morning. I have never drank before then and wouldn\u2019t do just for the sake of it.\u2019Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.If you've got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE: Why is Holly Willoughby not on This Morning and when is she back?MORE: Drunk pilot was 10 times over the limit before his flight out of Heathrow\n\n\n\n"}
