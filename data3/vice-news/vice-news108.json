{"id": "When Does BDSM Become Abuse?", "paragraph": "Tank Hafertepen. Photo via tankhafertepen.com\u00a0In Instagram photos, Dylan Hafertepen, a master to five adult slaves, appears cartoonishly large, like a Tom of Finland sketch come to life. In one of his most iconic shots (since deleted from the gram) Dylan gives a military salute to the camera as his pups Chuck, Angus, Daniel, Biff and Tank pose around him. Some are wearing skin-tight jockstraps that barely contain their inflated ball sacks. Tank, whose given name was Jack Chapman, sits on Dylan\u2019s right side, wearing a red bandana, with a padlocked chain around his neck. He\u2019s beaming.To casual followers of Dylan\u2019s account, known as \u201cNoodles and Beef,\u201d his relationship with his pups seemed to be kinky and playful. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for fans (the account had over 60 thousand followers) to write Dylan, begging him to adopt them as their master, too. Dylan announced new additions to the family with theatrical flair. First, pups would earn training collars, then they\u2019d be emblazoned with a tattoo above their butt cheeks, known as \u201cMaster\u2019s brand.\u201d He heralded the addition of Angus by writing in his newsletter: \u201cHe is mine. The news brought him to tears.\u201d Angus responded floridly in the same newsletter, \u201cI had been lost and confused before, unaware I was always yours, oblivious to my reason to exist.\u201dDylan\u2019s pups had social media lives of their own, as well\u2014which their master couldn\u2019t always control. On Tumblr, Jack wrote long, anguished apologies to Dylan for not being the perfect pup. \u201cLet\u2019s get a few things established,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am shit. I am a shit person. I do horrible and inexcusable things. I am dishonest. I am deceitful. I am a coward. I am stupid. I hurt my master.\u201d His offense? Jumping into a hot tub with a friend. Jack\u2019s social media posts came to the attention of a broad audience on Tumblr when he died on October 15th \u201cdue to a previously undiagnosed lung ailment.\u201d That \u201cailment\u201d was later revealed to have been caused by bits of silicone from a scrotal injection that had traveled to his lungs. (Dylan\u2019s entire pup family were known to inject silicone in order to increase the size of their packages.) After his death, a contract that described Jack\u2019s relationship with Dylan, originally posted on Jack\u2019s Tumblr, was circulated online, describing a relationship in which Jack\u2019s psyche, bank account, body and social life were under the complete control of his master. The contract even stipulated how big Jack\u2019s body should be, saying that \u201da pup will submit all orders for body modifications, including piercings, tattoos and scrotal saline inflation\u2026in accordance to the wishes of master.\u201dDylan recently told BuzzFeed News that this contract was a piece of \u201ca piece of erotic fiction written by Tank, featuring some of his submissive fantasies.\u201d Still, it raised questions about what a loving, healthy BDSM relationship looks like and how observers could distinguish actual abuse from the simulated kind. Relationships between full-time, 24/7 masters and slaves haven\u2019t been extensively studied in academia, with one exception. Back in 2006, researchers at the University of Ottawa and the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality surveyed 146 masters and slaves to understand how they negotiated power, role-playing, household chores and even money. The researchers wondered: how could slaves consent when they had given up all rights to participate in decision-making in the relationship? And were people  happy as slaves, long term? Some of the results were intriguing, if a bit mundane: the researchers found that male slaves were more likely to take out the garbage than female slaves, for example. Other findings were more illuminating: around three-quarters of slaves had engaged in behavior that seemed \u201cinconceivable\u201d at the start of their relationship, suggesting that \u201climit-pushing\u201d was common. They also noted that many slaves felt satisfied in their current relationships and were free to leave. Financial independence was the norm, not the exception: only three respondents had no access to a bank account in their own names. Nonetheless, the researchers noted that abuse could easily masquerade as BDSM. \u201cSome spousal abusers could use such arrangements to legitimize or otherwise find support for their abusive inclinations or intentions,\u201d the article read. Slaves on the prowl for new masters, they noted, were \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of this danger. Ellen Lee, an instructor of psychology at Ripon College, spent the last seven years studying the master slave community as part of \u201cThe Science of BDSM\u201d research team based at Northern Illinois University. While she says contracts are common, they\u2019re usually meant as a safeguard for all parties involved\u2014and not as a carte-blanche method for masters to take full control over every facet of their slaves\u2019 lives. \u201cThe goal is to iron out what people want and what they don\u2019t want,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re used for people to think very carefully and thoroughly about the boundaries of their relationships.\u201d Worryingly, in Jack\u2019s supposed contract with Dylan, his salary was meant to be \u201crelinquished to his Master,\u201d who was supposed to ensure it would be securely saved. \u201cI can tell you that with abusive relationships, one of the hallmarks is limiting access to financial resources,\u201d says Lee. \u201cWithout money, they can\u2019t leave. That\u2019s not consent, that\u2019s coercion.\u201dAnother part of Dylan\u2019s contract allegedly stipulated that a pup\u2019s social life must revolve around his master and that he should find contact with other people \u201cpointless, unfruitful and unfulfilling.\u201d This also seemed extreme to Lee. \u201cSocial and emotional isolation is another hallmark of abuse,\u201d she said. In a healthy BDSM relationship, the submissive partner must have their needs met. The needs of the bottom come first, followed by the needs and wants of the person in authority, and, finally, the wants of the submissive partner. \u201cIf the person who\u2019s submissive isn\u2019t having their needs met, the relationship can\u2019t get off the ground,\u201d she says. Of course, two consenting adults can engage in any kind of dynamic they\u2019d like\u2014and master slave contracts are legally-dubious, having never been tried in U.S. court. Lee isn\u2019t comfortable speculating about what kind of relationship Tank and Dylan had, but she says that the BDSM community could be a place for people to hide abuse. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, largely, people in the community try to talk about safeguards, best practices and making sure others are aware that it\u2019s inherently risky playing with these power extremes.\u201d \u201cWe know assault and abuse happen in the kink community,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to think they\u2019re doing it better.\u201d Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.Follow Steven on Twitter.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily."}
