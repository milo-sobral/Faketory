Read:   Everything we know about the alleged Khashoggi murder and Saudi cover upDespite the change in tune, the new offering isn\u2019t likely to move the heat off of the kingdom\u2019s powerful young prince and de-facto leader, Mohammed Bin Salman. Prince Mohammed is believed to be behind the ordering of Khashoggi\u2019s death and was known to be at odds with the dissident\u2019s criticism of his rule. Yet, the U.S. has been cautious to direct blame toward the young Saudi leader. On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was giving the Saudi government \u201ca few more days\u201d to complete their own \"thorough investigation\" of what happened to Khashoggi before weighing in on the matter. President Trump has struck a similar tone, at once threatening a \u201cvery severe\u201d response while also coming to the kingdom\u2019s defense. "}
