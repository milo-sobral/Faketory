{"id": "Cecile Richards: 'Nancy Pelosi Is the Reason We Still Have Access to Abortion Rights'", "paragraph": "Image via Planned Parenthood.After Democrats won back the House of Representatives with the largest gains since Watergate, they now face a crucial choice: Who is going to assume the role of the Speaker of the House? Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2011, and during those years Leader Nancy Pelosi served as Speaker, making history as the first woman to ever hold the post. When she assumed the speakership, she did so with unanimous approval from fellow Democrats. The day after the midterm elections, Pelosi announced her plan to run to reassume the role. This time, she appears to lack the unanimous support.  Pelosi has been used as a boogeyman of sorts by Republicans, whose attack ads in competitive districts often feature her as a \u201cliberal elite.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s approval rating nationally tends to be lower than even Donald Trump\u2019s, and many candidates running in Republican leaning districts \u2013 for instance Andrew Janz who ran against Devin Nunes in California - explicitly said they would not support Pelosi becoming Speaker if they were elected. At the same time, some candidates running in ultra-progressive districts \u2013 like Rashida Tlaib in Michigan - also said it's unlikely they would vote for her as well. In her September TIME cover story, Pelosi herself acknowledged that she\u2019s aware of internal criticisms that included her being \u201ctoo old\u201d (she\u2019s 78), too toxic in non-Democratic districts, that she\u2019s already had 30 years in Congress\u2014 including 15 years of leading the Democrats\u2014 and that it\u2019s time for her to let the next generation have power.  Pelosi\u2019s critics, such as Ohio\u2019s Rep. Tim Ryan\u2014who unsuccessfully challenged her in 2016\u2014and Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Filemon Vela of Texas, have been reported to be making plans to replace her by refusing her the 218 votes she needs for the internal caucus vote on November 28, and by floating Rep. Marcia Fudge as a possible opponent. Meanwhile, her allies both inside and outside of Congress, including Rep. Maxine Waters and former attorney general Eric Holder, have been advocating on her behalf. On Thursday morning, former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who once worked as Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, made her thoughts of Pelosi\u2019s run known. Richards took to Twitter, where she released a forceful proclamation of her support for Pelosi based on her experience, and her anger at what she perceives as sexist targeting after an unprecedented success for Democrats in the \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d  \u201cI find it interesting that there are four leaders in Congress, only one is a woman, and she is the only person who folks are going after,\u201d she wrote. Richards said over the phone on Thursday that she took to Twitter to enthusiastically express her support for Pelosi after reading about Democratic members of Congress who were trying to keep her from becoming Speaker. \u201cI find it interesting that there are four leaders in Congress, only one is a woman, and she is the only person who folks are going after\" For Richards, that Pelosi is a woman is directly tied to why she is a target of a replacement campaign. \u201cWomen are a vast minority in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this challenge being led by women, you see it being led by four men, and so you can draw the conclusion that there are many men who are uncomfortable with women being in power.\u201d  Richards also said that over the past ten years, Republican operatives have actively made investments in advertisements and campaigns that discredit Pelosi, make fun of her, and have turn her into the face of liberalism for those who don\u2019t like liberals. \u201cThat really takes a toll,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I am just amazed to see Democratic leaders and people who know better fall for this, because it\u2019s completely orchestrated by the opposing party, and it just seems so evident to me.\u201d  The main point that Richards wanted to communicate through her comments on Twitter was not only why she thought some Democrats were attempting to prevent Pelosi from assuming the powerful role, but why Democrats should support her. Richards highlighted how Pelosi whipped her caucus to vote against the Iraq War under George Bush, and how last year in 2017 she filibustered the House floor in an attempt to force an immigration vote by speaking for over eight hours about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That speech may be the longest House speech ever delivered and was definitely the longest in the last century.  \u201cThese jobs are not easy, and they\u2019re not for amateurs,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a progressive from my core, and so is Nancy Pelosi. That\u2019s why I have complete faith in not only what she will do as the next Speaker, but in the next generation of leadership she will train and elevate in the process.\u201d Richards said the Trump administration being in power is a major reason why this isn\u2019t an ideal time to \u201ctry someone new out in the big leagues.\u201d \u201cI think people really need to think about this,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor those of us who care about women, immigration, civil rights, voting rights, LGBTQ equality, and so on, we\u2019re playing in a whole new world right now. We have an administration, and a Republican Lead Senate that is against every single thing we believe in.\u201d  Richards emphasized that, so long as Trump is in office, it\u2019s critical that Democrats act in unison as they fight for the things that people elected them to do. She also argued that it\u2019s important for people to understand Pelosi\u2019s career before writing her off. \u201cPeople's impressions get based on no information,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the reasons I wrote what I did today is because a woman I know said to me the other day something I couldn\u2019t believe. She was like, \u2018I need to know where Pelosi is on abortion rights,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Are you kidding? Nancy Pelosi is the reason we still have access to abortion rights under the Affordable Care Act.\u2019\u201d  Richards explained when the Affordable Care Act was on the verge of being passed, many members of Congress were ready to agree to it being passed while excluding abortion coverage. When Richards visited Pelosi in her office, she said Pelosi looked her in the eye and said, \u201cIf there is an abortion ban, there will not be an Affordable Care Act.\u201d When it comes to criticisms being lobbed against Pelosi, Richards said much of it is \u201ccentimeter deep and a mile wide\u201d and based on \u201cwhatever GOP line there is out there that day.\u201d In regards to Pelosi\u2019s glass ceiling shattering career, Richards doesn\u2019t feel Pelosi is given enough credit for what she\u2019s overcome. \u201cFor men, they kind of wake up one day and are like, \u2018I can be in Congress,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cFor women, it\u2019s a much harder struggle. Nancy Pelosi got there on her own, and so she knows what it takes to go out there and hustle, and this is what I saw women do this election cycle: Out-hustle their opponents, out-work their opponents, and go to Washington because they want to get something done.\u201d  In terms of Pelosi\u2019s accomplishments, Richards said there is no Speaker who has paralleled what she\u2019s accomplished when leading the majority, and also when leading the minority.  \u201cShe\u2019s done it at the same time as helping to build a caucus that\u2019s beginning to look as diverse as the rest of this country,\u201d Richards said. \u201cA caucus with new progressive women, people of color, women of color, LGBTQ people, who are going to rock Capitol Hill. That\u2019s something to look at and recognize.\u201d In Richards\u2019 eyes, Pelosi deserves to sit in the seat at the table that she fought so for many years to obtain, a seat Richards also believes will be filled by many more women in the future.  \u201cI think for women in this country, it\u2019s time we stop being shut down by loud angry men, and that goes for both parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be loud and to be proud.\u201dGet your horoscope in your inbox, every day."}
