The indictment marks the first official acknowledgement that Russians are working to influence the 2018 midterm elections.  Khusyaynova was allegedly the chief accountant for \u201cProject Lakhta,\u201d a Russian effort composed of hundreds of people and numerous entities including the notorious \u201ctroll factory\u201d Internet Research Agency (IRA). The program began in 2014 and was meant to sow political division in the US through social networks, according to a press release by the Department of Justice. Khusyaynova is accused of managing the financing for the project, which was aimed at conducting \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d as the organization allegedly called it internally.  \u201cSince at least May 2014, Project Lakhta\u2019s stated goal in the United States was to spread mistrust towards candidates for political office and the political system in general,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the indictment.  The disinformation campaigns, according to prosecutors, focused on topics such as the Second Amendment, race relations, LGBTQ issues, and the NFL anthem debate. The members of the organization had the goal of creating \u201cpolitical intensity through supporting radical groups\u201d and \u201c[aggravating] the conflict between minorities and the rest of the population,\u201d according to the DOJ.

Khusyaynova and the other members of the project \u201coperated fictitious social media personas, pages, and groups designed to attract US audiences and to address divisive US political and social issues or advocate for the election or electoral defeat of particular candidates,\u201d the indictment reads. For example, the operators used sockpuppet accounts on Twitter to attack Democratic Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, and to support Democratic candidate Doug Jones in Alabama.  The Russian operators also convinced real Americans to participate in the effort by moderating Facebook groups, the indictment claims.  \u201cHey girl! How u doing?\u201d one of the Russian operators wrote to someone only identified as US Person 2 over Facebook. \u201cRemember u wanted to help me with that page i\u2019m working on?
