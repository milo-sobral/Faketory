Many didn\u2019t \u2014 sidewalk chalking, whether for student government or a contested congressional seat, isn\u2019t too unusual. But a few of the sidewalk messages outraged some students. Some messages read \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white,\u201d according to student newspaper the Iowa State Daily. The most inflammatory stuff had been power-washed away by Friday morning, according to one campus employee who asked to not be named because he wasn\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. What remained was messaging supporting embattled Republican Rep. Steve King \u2014 the congressman for Iowa\u2019s rural 4th district who could lose his previously safe seat in the wake of allegations that he\u2019s gotten too cozy with white nationalists. The controversial eight-term politician has in recent weeks offered a Twitter endorsement for a candidate associated with white nationalists, Faith Goldy, who recently lost Toronto\u2019s mayoral race. King called her \u201cpro-Western.\u201d The Washington Post also reported that King met with a far-right Austrian political party with historical Nazi ties \u2014 and more recent neo-Nazi affiliations \u2014 in August. King has defended that meeting while also denying allegations that he\u2019s anti-Semitic and blaming \u201cfake news\u201d for misinterpreting his words and attacking him.

Some of King\u2019s corporate donors, including the dairy cooperative Land O\u2019Lakes, Purina PetCare, and Intel said amid last week's backlash that they\u2019re not going to contribute to his campaign anymore. Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, wrote in a tweet Tuesday that King\u2019s \u201crecent comments, actions and retweets are completely inappropriate.\u201d \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms,\u201d Stivers wrote in the tweet.The Iowa State College Republicans still endorse King \u2014 an immigration hardliner and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 and said in a statement posted to their Twitter page Wednesday that the \u201callegations against him are baseless and untrue.\u201d   Dalton Doom, a senior from Urbandale studying aerospace engineering, said he had been planning to vote for King but is now reconsidering. Doom said he voted for an independent candidate in the 2016 presidential election, but he\u2019s aligned with conservatives since then.   \u201cI know there\u2019s been controversy, he\u2019s been accused of having less than great opinions,\u201d Doom said of King. \u201cBut what drives his policy? How does it translate?\u201dIn what\u2019s projected to be a neck-and-neck election for King and Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten on Nov. 6, every vote will count. Some recent polls show the race as a toss-up, while Cook Political Report sees Iowa\u2019s 4th District leaning Republican. FiveThirtyEight, meanwhile, gives King a nearly 86 percent chance of winning. Scholten is swimming in campaign donations as compared to King. While King has already spent most of his approximately $740,000 in fundraising on administrative expenses like salaries or fundraising, according to federal campaign filings, Scholten, a former professional baseball player and paralegal from Iowa, has raised more than $1.7 million, and is in the middle of an aggressive advertising campaign. About 33 percent of registered, active voters in Story County, where Ames and the university are located, are Democrats, according to data kept by the Iowa secretary of state. About 28 percent are Republicans, and 37 percent of voters fall into the \u201cno party\u201d camp.And Iowans turn out to vote. In the 2014 midterm elections cycle, the entire state saw the highest voter turnout for a midterm election in 30 years, according to The Gazette in Cedar Rapids \u2014 a stark contrast to the rest of the United States that year, which saw the lowest turnout in 70 years. About 51 percent of Story County's voters went to the polls.   Read more: These 7 key midterms races are in dead heats.  Turnout is much lower among young voters. About 25 percent of Democrats ages 18 to 24 turned out for the last midterm election in 2014, according to state data. Of Republicans in that age group, nearly 35 percent of registered voters turned out. That\u2019s still very low compared to a turnout of 83 percent among Republican voters over the age of 65 that year, for example.Sen. Bernie Sanders came to campus last month to drum up student support for Scholten, but at Iowa State, it wasn\u2019t evident that the controversy over King \u2014 or even the graffiti on their own sidewalks \u2014 would drive an exceptional number of students to vote. Travis Gillham, a senior studying electrical engineering, said he\u2019s not planning to vote. He\u2019s seen the sidewalk chalking, and heard people talking about the elections, but said he\u2019s not political and \u201cnot up to date.\u201d\u201cIf all my classes got really free and some huge news broke, maybe\u201d he\u2019d vote, Gillham added.  \u201cI know that Bernie endorses [Scholten],\u201d Wiesenmayer, who already voted and is a volunteer for NextGen America, said. \u201cHe just seems like somebody who cares about people more, and he doesn\u2019t take corporate contributions to his campaign, and I\u2019m a big fan of that.\u201d  But many students approached by VICE News said they weren\u2019t following the midterms, weren't voting, or both.Larry Morgan, a 26-year-old student at the North Iowa Area Community College who was studying in a Starbucks near Iowa State University\u2019s main campus Friday, said he\u2019s not planning to vote on Tuesday. He also didn\u2019t vote in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the laws are meant to benefit me,\u201d Morgan, who is black, said. When asked about whether he believes King is racist, Morgan said \u201ca lot of them are,\u201d referring to politicians.Grace Lazard, a senior studying liberal arts and science at Iowa State, is following U.S. politics closely, but is British and also unable to vote in the midterms.\u201cThis state, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s weird,\u201d Lazard, who is black, said. Pointing to the story about the controversial chalk messages on the front page of the Iowa State Daily, she commented, \u201cthings like this \u2014 all that racism, people are now comfortable with it.\u201d   Ana DiSpirito, a 19-year-old sophomore and Ames local, said \u201cwith Trump, it\u2019s become more acceptable for white supremacy.\u201d If allegations about King being associated with white supremacists are true, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change the election,\u201d she said. \u201cI really doubt it.\u201d    Listen to Episode 1 of \"Chapo: Kingpin on Trial\":   Cover: Graffiti on the sidewalks of Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa on Nov. 2, 2018.
