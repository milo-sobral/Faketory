{"id": "This Heavy Bonnie Baxter Mix Tastes Like Dirt and Rocks and Socks ", "paragraph": " Bonnie Baxter is capable of destruction. You might know that if you\u2019ve seen her band Kill Alters play. At present, they\u2019re an active part of New York City\u2019s community of underground noise weirdos that Baxter dubs \u201cmutants.\u201d Over the past few years if you\u2019ve ended up at any DIY space whose bookings tend toward the heavy and surreal, you\u2019ve probably seen them shredding with Baxter upfront, often barefoot, eyes-rolled back, ranting and screaming into a throng of onlookers. It\u2019s the sorta stuff that makes otherwise reasonable people wanna try to run through brick walls.  Today, Baxter released a solo tape on Hausu Mountain called Ask Me How Satan Started, and if you have any illusions that her work away from her band might relent even a little, allow me to relate a story of the first time I saw her play solo. In 2016, Baxter took the stage at a venue in Bushwick to open for the Chicago drone-improv trio Good Willsmith\u2014two members of which run Hausu Mountain, incidentally. Armed with little more than a sampler she started playing these absolutely punishing beats, battering the assembled crowd until a strange smell started seeping into the room, and then a haze. The problem soon became clear as the sound engineer rushed to the stage where a monitor was pouring out smoke, literally unable to handle the bass frequencies Baxter was sending from her setup. \u201cI thought someone turned on a fog machine,\u201d she remembers via email. \u201cI apologized. I\u2019m not trying to break other people\u2019s shit.\u201d  Whether she wants to glorify the sonic vandalism or not, that tale is telling of the sort of music she makes, just unspeakably heavy, endearingly absurdist takes on hard techno tropes. On  Ask Me How Satan Started, the sounds are furious, uncoiling with the anarchic energy of the Industrial Strength Records catalog, but they\u2019re funny too\u2014it more or less starts with her assuring someone that she\u2019ll punch them in the nards. So it\u2019s kinda a weird thing, a beat-heavy noise tape with dick jokes. But if that sounds like your sort of trip, or if you just wanna get pummeled, it\u2019s worth your time.  In celebration, Baxter also put together a mix for Noisey which includes a fair few of her friends from around the freak scene. It\u2019s got blistered beats, slapstick sound collages, and a few exclusive collaborations with some of her close buds. It\u2019s bracing, but ecstatic, exactly the sort of thing you\u2019d hope for form this one-person wrecking crew. Listen loud, it probably won\u2019t break your speakers.  Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting?Bonnie Baxter: Where you\u2019d be least distracted  Is synesthesia a real thing, and if so, what color is this mix?I taste dirt and rocks and some socks.  Was there any specific concept to the mix?I wanted to include music I love by friends and music that I feel connected with overall.  Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?I got Pepper Mill Rondo\u2019s satan rant stuck in my head.  In your email you described this as a \u201cHeart/Mind\u201d mix. I think a lot of people hear noisy, lo-fi music and immediately think it comes from a place of anger or dejection. Does calling this mix Heart/Mind suggest that you get something else out of this music?I like music that I feel connects to my heart/mind, which is the music you get lost in, that shifts attention away from the brain and connects to the heart. The heart/mind conveys actual ideas, information and images to the brain where these signals are then converted into words, pictures, sounds etc. The brain is powerful but the heart field envelopes the entire body and extends beyond that. This is real science. Ok. You know what I mean. Listen to your heart, listen to your farts.  This mix has a couple of tracks from people who kinda operate in the same weirdo NY underground that you do. Do you feel a sense of community and kinship right now?Yes, we call them MUTANTS. And it\u2019s real kinetic energy happening right now. Just gonna do an NYC mutant blast here.

Tell me about   Ask Me How Satan Started . I know it went up on your bandcamp a few months ago, and now it\u2019s properly out through Hausu Mountain, but where did these tracks come from? Were there any unifying principles or themes?I had been planning to record this in one take much like how I would playing live with my Korg Electribes. I had written out a rough set so I'd have the core. I also played with recorded samples of my voice through an iPad. The Kill Alters Archive where I have a conversation with my mom about good vs evil as a little girl was then added in and the very last track \u201cSatan\u2019s Angels\u201d was a track I recorded after sending the tape to Hausu Mountain. Some of these tracks actually were actually intended for Kill Alters too but ended working better for this tape.  Tracklist:\"We Are Lift Boys\" - Lift Boys A.K.A.
