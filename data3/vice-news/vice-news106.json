{"id": "Man Arrested for Threatening to 'Blow Up Restaurant' Says He Just Wanted to Take a Dump", "paragraph": "Photo: Education Images/UIG via Getty Images Look, we appreciate a good poop joke as much as the next 13-year-old, but if your alleged attempt at bathroom humor ends with a mugshot, an arrest warrant, and a pair of serious-sounding charges, you might be doing it wrong.  According to the Times-Picayune, 30-year-old Arthur Posey walked into a Willie\u2019s Chicken Shack in New Orleans at about 7 PM Tuesday night. According to Posey, he commented to a female manager that he was going to \u201cblow the bathroom up\u201d and\u2014again, according to him\u2014what he meant was that he was going to take a massive shit. (Arthur, regardless of how this all shakes out, you need to work on your game.)  But according to the  manager, Posey strolled into the restaurant, walked toward the food-prep area, and asked her how late the restaurant stayed open. She told him she didn\u2019t know (side note: YOU\u2019RE THE MANAGER, why don\u2019t you know this???), and he told her \u201cY\u2019all about to close right now, because I\u2019m going to get a bomb and blow this place up.\u201d She reported the incident to the Chicken Shack\u2019s general manager, who advised her to call the police.  Posey had left the restaurant by the time the officers arrived, but they spotted him walking into a different business on the next block. He told the cops that he didn\u2019t have a bomb, and just meant that he was about to \u201cblow the bathroom up\u201d with a swift, unyielding bowel movement.  The police didn\u2019t buy it\u2014especially not after the manager said that Posey never mentioned a bathroom to her. A second employee told officers that she heard him say that he was \u201cgoing to get a bomb and put it under the middle table of the restaurant closest to the front door,\u201d which sounds both weirdly specific and strangely\u2026 not at all like what the manager reported.  Posey was taken into custody, and is facing two counts of \u201ccommunicating of false information of planned arson,\u201d which has to be one of the most grammatically awkward charges a person can face. Orleans Parish Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell scheduled a mental competency hearing for Posey on November 29.  If Posey\u2019s account of events was true, we hope he found a bathroom.
