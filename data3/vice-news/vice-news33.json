{"id": "Canadians Searched for a Lot of Weed Porn on Legalization Day ", "paragraph": "Photo via Brazzers\u00a0This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.People who smoke weed will tell you that being high makes you horny and can make sex more enjoyable. But it seems a bunch of Canadians got horny  for weed when it became legal last week.According to PornHub, searches from Canadians involving weed were up 206 percent on October 17. Some of the more common searches were basic e.g. \u201cweed\u201d \u201csmoking weed\u201d and \u201cweed sex\u201d (as a side note, why would you want to watch two stoned people bang?). But others were much more creative. Who doesn\u2019t want to get stoned and watch \u201chorny weed\u201d a \u201c420 baddie\u201d or \u201clesbians smoking weed\u201d?Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia are evidently the horniest for weed, according to PornHub\u2019s region-based search statistics. I guess that makes sense\u2014weed was legal in Canada's provinces bordering the Atlantic before anywhere else and Nova Scotians do smoke the most weed per capita in the country. In terms of our world standing, Canadians are 224 percent more likely than citizens of other countries to search for weed-related porn and we rank fourth in the world for such searches, just behind Kenya, Switzerland, and South Africa.
