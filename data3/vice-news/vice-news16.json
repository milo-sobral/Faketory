{"id": "Amigo the Devil's Murder Folk Mixes Southern Gothic with Doom Vibes", "paragraph": "Photo courtesy of Amigo the Devil Amigo the Devil is a strange, hard-to-define entity that hovers like a slightly vengeful ghost around the peripheries of metal, dark folk, and Americana, claimed by none but with roots in all three. I\u2019ve seen the singer-songwriter\u2019s work described as \u201cmurder folk\u201d in more than a few places, which is both delightful and apt, since his output camps out at the crossroads of Devil Makes Three, 16 Horsepower, and Danzig, and his lyrics concern themselves with murder as often as they do love, libations, and self-loathing.  Despite his allegiance with the scene itself, the only real heavy metal influence at work here is in the devilish atmosphere and an overall pit-dark vibe that\u2019s a few shades past Southern gothic, and had landed him on lineups with outright doom bands more than once. It\u2019s a curious position to occupy, but Amigo the Devil and his waitin\u2019-around-to-die music makes it seem natural.  Everything Is Fine marks the project\u2019s first proper full-length, and in spite of its downhome, rough-hewn feel, comes stacked with highfalutin credentials. Produced by Ross Robinson (Korn, Slipknot, At The Drive In, Glassjaw), its percussive elements shaped by drummer Brad Wilk (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Prophets of Rage), and recorded at Valentine Studios on original 70s-era gear, the album is ultimately a backcountry nightmare, soundtracked by raspy, slightly unhinged vocals and an overall apocalyptic bent (\u201cI Hope Your Husband Dies\u201d is a standout, as is the absolutely miserable bluegrass ballad \u201cCocaine and Abel\u201d).
