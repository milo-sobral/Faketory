I am not leaving until they are open. We are going to stay there until he opens them. Until God touches the heart of Donald Trump.\u201dOn Friday morning, Gutierrez and hundreds of others set out for the Guatemalan border town of Tecun Uman, where migrants have been gathering for days. \u201cWe are going to stay there until he opens them. Until God touches the heart of Donald Trump.\u201dThings are getting desperate. On Friday, thousands crammed, shoulder to shoulder, onto a bridge into Mexico, but no one was being let in. The migrants broke out into sporadic chants of \u201csi se puede.\u201d Those who rushed the gate were greeted by tear gas canisters thrown by the Mexican Federal Police.As their calls went unanswered, some of the migrants began jumping from the bridge into the Suchiata River below, as there was no turning back once they reached the middle of the bridge. Meanwhile, hundreds of migrants roamed the banks of the river to see if they could find a place to cross without being apprehended. Mexican officials have said they will turn away anyone without a valid passport and a Mexican visa. That\u2019s the case for most of the thousands of migrants who have arrived so far in Tecun Uman. In response, the Mexican government sent 300 additional federal troops to the Guatemalan border and asked the United Nations refugee agency to help process migrants seeking refugee status.Trump has threatened to pull aid from Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador if they didn\u2019t stop the caravan. He has also threatened to punish Mexico if they don\u2019t stop the migrants by pulling out of the newly signed trade agreement that replaces NAFTA.\u201cWith so many people, the authorities can\u2019t do anything. They have to let us pass.\u201dNone of this seems to discourage the migrants still making their way to Tecun Uman, who seem quite aware of what awaits them but still think it\u2019s preferable to what they\u2019re leaving behind.Manuel Cano, 33, from El Salvador, said he saw the caravan as it was passing his house and decided to join with his family. He was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Jocelyn, on his shoulders as he walked from Mazatenango toward Tecun Uman. He had tried to reach the United States in previous years before but failed to make it. Cano had recently heard Mexico was giving work visas to Central American migrants \u2014 a proposal Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has floated. \u201cWith more people, we get braver,\u201d he said. Cano had heard there were federal police waiting at the Mexican border, but he was undeterred. \u201cYou have to take a chance.\u201d If the migrants make it into Mexico, President Trump has threatened to deploy military to the U.S. border, which he cannot legally do. He has also turned it into an issue in the upcoming midterm elections. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an election of the caravan,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Montana Thursday night.Most of the migrants, however, are completely disconnected from the news, and what they do hear comes from Facebook or via word of mouth. They don\u2019t have money to charge their telephones, and they are following the people in front of them. Most have traveled for days, and the idea of turning back is not even a question.At the sports center in Mazatenango on Friday morning, where hundreds of migrants were taking shelter, about a hundred people lined up for breakfast on the basketball court. It\u2019s more bread. But no one complains. The Guatemalans have been extraordinarily generous, the Honduran migrants say.Before dawn, dozens of people left the shelter en route to the Mexican border city of Tecun Uman. It\u2019s only about two hours away by car, but most people are walking, at least for part of the trip. Nobody is quite sure how long it will take. By 7:30 a.m., the stadium is cleared out.\u201cI saw it on the television and decided to join,\u201d said Sandy Sarandino Mesa, 28. That was three days ago. \u201cI had thought about coming before but didn\u2019t have the opportunity. But as God gave us this chance, I decided to take advantage of it.\u201dSarandino said she worked in the coffee fields in Honduras as a seasonal worker, earning around $60 a week. She said her husband was killed by gang members three months ago. Like most people here, Sarandino has heard only rumors about what\u2019s in store for them at the Mexican border. \u201cI heard they are going to let us pass, but I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d Then, she repeated a refrain many migrants say: \u201cWith so many people, the authorities can\u2019t do anything. They have to let us pass.\u201dCover image: Honduran migrants rush across the border towards Mexico, in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, Friday, Oct. 19, 2018.
