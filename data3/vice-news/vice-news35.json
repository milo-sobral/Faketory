{"id": "Pour Out Some Cream of Mushroom Soup in Memory of the Creator of Green Bean Casserole", "paragraph": "Photo by Munchies Staff.Americans would love to think that all of the things we eat for Thanksgiving dinner are categorically American\u2122 foods because we eat them on a categorically American\u2122 holiday. But, sorry to be the bubble-burster here\u2014they\u2019re not. We don\u2019t own the patent on over-roasted turkeys and we certainly aren\u2019t the only people putting apples and pumpkins into pies. But there is one dish that has become a staple of millions of American households\u2019 holiday tables that we can fully claim as our own: the green bean casserole. Originally called a \u201cgreen bean bake,\u201d the recipe was created in the Campbell\u2019s Soup Company\u2019s test kitchen in New Jersey in 1955 by one Dorcas Reilly, who sadly passed away last week at the age of 92 of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Reilly and her compatriots in the Campbell\u2019s test kitchen were tasked with creating recipes that utilized the company\u2019s roster of canned products, and especially in combination with other common food products a family was likely to have hanging around the house anyway. The original recipe called for a can of Campbell\u2019s cream of mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce, black pepper, fresh green beans, and French\u2019s fried onion strings. That original recipe card is now housed in the National Inventors Hall of Fame alongside other revolutionary innovations like Thomas Edison\u2019s light bulb, as the Washington Post noted in Reilly's obituary.When interviewed by the Associated Press in 2005 for a piece commemorating the dish\u2019s 50th anniversary, Reilly claimed she didn\u2019t even remember coming up with it, because it was just one of hundreds of recipes she developed during her time at Campbell\u2019s. Which is a pretty amazing flex considering the recipe is still being printed on cream of mushroom soup labels exactly as written, and that Campbell\u2019s estimates that about 40 percent of that particular soup\u2019s sales are made specifically for going into that dish. We\u2019d never claim to be able to improve upon Reilly\u2019s perfection, because to do so would be sacrilege and possibly considered high treason. So we give her all due props for inspiring generations of cooks to create their own versions of her iconic dish.  Maybe you\u2019ll consider Naomi Pomeroy\u2019s just-a-little-bit-cheffier version of the classic casserole for your holiday feasting this year instead of Reilly\u2019s, with fresh chanterelle mushrooms and a smoked gouda cheese sauce in place of the traditional cream o\u2019 mushroom soup.  If one were to find any flaw in Reilly\u2019s original recipe, it is that the vegans of the world are excluded from experiencing it. Here, we use hemp milk to keep things strictly plant-based. Make sure at least some version of the green bean casserole makes it to your Thanksgiving table this year to honor the legendary Reilly and her culinary legacy.Subscribe to Munchies."}
