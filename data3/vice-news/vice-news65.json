{"id": "The \"concealed carry\" fashion show is for people who want to hide their guns", "paragraph": "Watch VICE News Tonight on HBO weekdays at 7:30.CHICAGO \u2014 This fashion show comes with a trigger warning.It might not look like the runways of Milan Fashion Week, but the Second Amendment Foundation\u2019s Concealed Carry Fashion Show carries influence far beyond seasonal style trends. At this year's show, held on the basement level of a Hyatt Hotel in Chicago in late September, models showed off nylon leggings that can hide at least three guns, a dainty blouse with side panels for comfortably stowing a pistol, and other \"packable\" wearables \u2014 all designed for an expanding market.The number of Americans with concealed carry permits is growing each year. In 2014, an estimated 11 million had concealed carry permits, and now there's at least 14.5 million, which is more than 6 percent of the adult population. Activists in the pro-gun community have increasingly turned to fashion shows as a way to take the concealed-carry market mainstream. \u201cEye on the Target\u201d radio host Amanda Suffecool \u2014 who organized the Second Amendment's show \u2014 set the trend by producing the NRA\u2019s first fashion show in 2017. She sees the shows in part as an opportunity to \u201cnormalize\u201d concealed carry and also to flaunt what some firearms activists have dubbed \u201cGun Culture 2.0.,\u201d where women, members of the LGBTQ community, and people of color are arming themselves for self-defense instead of recreation. The models Suffecool picked for the Chicago show \u2013 activists and social media influencers \u2013 represent this new face of the Second Amendment community.Practical gear for an expanding market makes sense, but the models and activists in the concealed carry fashion show have another goal in mind: national reciprocity. A concealed carry reciprocity act passed the House last December and is awaiting a vote to be scheduled in the Senate.The act would mean that a concealed carry permit obtained in one state would automatically be accepted in every other state. So someone with a license from a state like Missouri where there are no restrictions, such as mandatory training or background checks, could carry their gun anywhere. \u201cThe objectives for a concealed carry fashion show, for me, is to normalize conceal carry,\u201d Suffecool told VICE News. \u201cI am so much an advocate for national reciprocity, the same way we have for driver's licenses.\u201dTess Owen contributed to this report.
