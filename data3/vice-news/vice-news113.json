{"id": "Study Says Students Would Rather Go Without Food than Without Their Phones", "paragraph": "Photo: BSIP/UIG via Getty Images I\u2019ve started to dread Monday mornings for a new and different reason lately, and it\u2019s one that has zero to do with the workweek. Instead, it\u2019s because Monday is when my stupid iPhone sends me its stupid Weekly Summary that calculates how much stupid screen time I had during the previous week. Yeah, iPhone, I get it: I\u2019m trash.  That Weekly Summary isn\u2019t helpful, it\u2019s not changing my behavior, and it\u2019s not turning me into a better person; all it\u2019s doing is making me resent iOS12 (and yes, I had to pick up my GOTT-DAMN PHONE just to confirm what iOS it\u2019s running). It\u2019s no secret that none of us have any chill and we all spend too much time staring at these shiny little demons, but a new paper published in the journal  Addictive Behaviors shows just how fucked up our phone obsessions are.  First, this paper was published in a journal called  Addictive Behaviors, which is a huge tip-off. Next, according to lead author Sara O\u2019Donnell, college students would rather go without food than without their phones. For the study, 76 college students between the ages of 18 and 22 were denied food for three hours and were denied the use of their phones for two hours. During that time, they were allowed to either study or read a newspaper. (I\u2019m assuming that they spent a full 20 minutes of that time sounding out the word \u2018newspaper\u2019 and promising themselves that they\u2019d Google it when they got their phones back).  After what O\u2019Donnell described as a \u201cmodest deprivation period,\u201d the participants were allowed to do a task on the computer in order to either earn some phone time or a 100-calorie serving of their fave snacks. Every time they opted for either reward, the time it took to earn additional phone time or additional food increased. According to the University of Buffalo, there were two parts to the study: the first part was a questionnaire that asked the participants how many minutes of phone usage they would buy at a number of different price points from $0 per minute to $1,120 per minute. The second part measured how many mouse clicks each student would be willing to make in order to earn some phone time.  The purpose, O\u2019Donnell said, was to measure whether smartphone use served as a \u201creinforcing behavior\u201d in the same way that food, alcohol, or drugs could reinforce their behaviors. The answer? O B V I O U S L Y.  \u201cIn this study, we provide evidence for the first time that smartphones are reinforcing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also found that when deprived of both food and smartphones, students were much more motivated to work for time to use their smartphone, and were willing to part with more hypothetical money to gain access to their phone.\u201d (And even the researchers were \u201cvery surprised\u201d by those results). O\u2019Donnell said that research into smartphone addiction\u2014as a real addiction, not just  yaasss I\u2019m addicted\u2014is still in its nascent stages, but this study suggests that our smartphones are \u201chighly reinforcing.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if that makes me feel better or worse about the ever-increasing number on my Weekly Summary. Maybe I should look that up. Subscribe to Munchies."}
