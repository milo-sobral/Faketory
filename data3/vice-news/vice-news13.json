The plot is allegedly funded by notorious Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, dubbed \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d due to his closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his background in the restaurant business. Prigozhin, two of his companies, and 12 others were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller in February for allegedly running a large, organized, online operation to interfere with the American political system.

Between January 2016 and June 2018, Project Lakhta\u2019s proposed operating budget was over $35 million, the Department of Justice said. Between January and June 2018 alone, the project\u2019s proposed operating budget exceeded $10 million.Prigozhin has consistently dismissed the charges against him as unfounded, and one of his companies, Concord Management and Consulting Ltd., has hired a top-shelf team of Washington lawyers to fight Mueller in a U.S. court. He's also laughed off U.S. efforts to swipe back at him, including through sanctions. After one recent round of U.S. sanctions in March, the man known for cooking even cracked a food joke.\u201cI have no business in the U.S. or with Americans,\u201d Prigozhin said at the time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.
