Botnik is a Seattle-based writing collective that uses artificial intelligence and other machine learning techniques to write funny stuff. Basically, it\u2019s a group of humans that collaborates with various bots to make stuff that probably wouldn\u2019t get made otherwise, like computer-generated Netflix rom-coms, Oscar ballots and new Harry Potter books.Now they're turning their attention to music with the release of \"The Songularity,\" an album of songs written with Voicebox, a predictive text algorithm that suggests words in the style of any source text you feed into it. The first single is called \u201cBored With This Desire to Get Ripped,\u201d which is a Smiths-esque jam, set to lyrics based on the entire oeuvre of Morrissey \u2014 and all the Amazon customer reviews of the P90x workout DVDs.
