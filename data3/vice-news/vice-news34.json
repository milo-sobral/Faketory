{"id": "Nashville Gay Bars Are Receiving Threatening 'LGBT' Flyers with MAGA Return Address", "paragraph": "Photo: Getty Images /\u00a0Yana Paskova\u00a0/ Stringer On Tuesday afternoon, the Stirrup Sports Bar in Nashville encouraged both its regulars and regular locals to meet at the bar, so they could carpool to the closest polling place to vote early. After that, it offered $5 drink specials to anyone who flashed an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker while they played a round of political trivia. So yeah, it was a pretty normal Tuesday at Stirrup, even though it had just received some vaguely threatening mail a few days earlier. According to NewsChannel5, someone sent identical flyers to Stirrup and at least four other Nashville-area gay bars last week. The only text on each flyer were the letters LGBT, and each letter corresponded to one of the four red, white, and blue pictures printed above them. Instead of \u2018lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender,\u2019  this LGBT was an acronym for the Statue of Liberty, a  Gun, a bottle of  Beer, and President Donald  Trump.  Each envelope had a red MAGA stamp in the upper left corner, and the return address corresponded with an empty lot in downtown Nashville. As of this writing, no individual or group has taken responsibility for sending the letters.  Most troubling was the fact that the gun pictured on the flyer was an assault rifle, similar to the one used in the deadly Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. \u201cWe live in a post-Pulse world in the LGBTQ community, especially in the bar scene,\u201d Stirrup owner Melvin Brown told NBC News. \u201cTo see somebody send a postcard that had a picture of the weapon used in one of the deadliest assaults in this nation\u2019s history, and one that happened at an LGBTQ bar, and to send that image to LGBTQ bars, to me is not a coincidence.\u201d A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department told the news outlet that it was not currently investigating the incidents, but that it had increased its patrols in areas of the city where gay bars are located.  Despite the unpleasantness that appeared in Stirrup\u2019s mailbox last week, it\u2019s still business as usual inside the bar. \u201cI\u2019d say to [whoever sent the flyers] that they won\u2019t succeed,\u201d Brown told MUNCHIES. \u201cWe are a community that rallies when we are treated as less than equal. This will only strengthen us.\u201d He said he has chosen to share the letter to remind everyone of the hate that the LGBTQ community continues to face. \u201cI know people might believe things are equal and fair but they aren\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need awareness of the struggle.\u201d There  was a bright spot in Stirrup\u2019s week, though: yesterday\u2019s mass voting event was a success. \u201cWe had a large group of customers,\u201d Brown said. We even motivated some to vote for the first time.\u201dSubscribe to Munchies."}
