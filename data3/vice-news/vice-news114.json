Nancy Pelosi. But that doesn\u2019t mean the 29-year-old is anti-Pelosi. The Democrat insurgent from the Bronx wants to use her newfound national prominence to force climate change onto the top of her party\u2019s agenda, and if Pelosi agrees, she\u2019s open to supporting her bid to be re-elected Speaker of the House. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opening, for sure,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told VICE News while she was rushing to an event for freshman lawmakers in the sprawling Capitol complex. \u201cThis is not about supporting or not supporting an individual. It\u2019s about making sure that we can get as progressive and aggressive of legislation as a party on climate change as quickly as possible.\u201dIf Pelosi wants the gavel for the second time in her decades-long career, she\u2019s going to need the support of Ocasio-Cortez and many more of the 50 freshman Democrats elected to Congress in the midterms earlier this month. Close to 60 Democratic challengers and incumbents alike publicly vowed to never support Pelosi during the heat of their campaigns. The former speaker can still overcome that opposition to win the majority of votes within the Democratic caucus when they vote as a party later this month. But the big test comes in January when she\u2019ll need the support of at least 218 members of the House, meaning merely 16 Democrats can derail Pelosi. That makes the freshman Democrats a powerful block, and they seem to know it.Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shook up the Capitol this week by cheering on a group of climate activists protesting inside the office of Rep.

That makes the freshman Democrats a powerful block, and they seem to know it.\u201cI want appropriations,\u201d said Rashida Tlaib, who's soon to be sworn in to represent part of Detroit in the third-poorest congressional district in the nation. As one of the nation\u2019s first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress, she\u2019s brimming with pride over the diversity of her freshman classmates.Read: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's room for Democratic socialists in the Democratic PartyBut she argues their rainbow of backgrounds and identities is diminished if the old Democratic guard relegates them to a category of second-class legislators from Day One. What Tlaib wants from Pelosi in exchange for her vote is a seat on the all-powerful Appropriations Committee, which she says will give her the perch needed to help her neighbors back in Michigan. \u201cReal leadership sometimes means allowing a lot of us to be able to be at the table where decisions can be made,\u201d she said.A lot of the Democratic freshmen are looking at the first bill Pelosi plans to bring up for a vote, which focuses on increasing voting access, enhancing ethics laws and curtailing Big Money\u2019s influence in elections. That\u2019s not good enough for Ayanna Pressley. Like Ocasio-Cortez, she also ousted a longtime Democratic incumbent in her Boston district. She\u2019s also open to supporting Pelosi, but for now she\u2019s hesitant because Pelosi's first bill doesn\u2019t address the gun violence plaguing every corner of the nation. \u201cThis is not the time to be timid. This is the time to really be bold, and that is the mandate the electorate has given us,\u201d Pressley said on a bench in the basement of the Capitol as she changed from unforgiving heels to more-comfortable gym shoes. \u201cAll of us ran on bold policy ideas, and I want us to send that signal early on that that\u2019s the work we\u2019ll be doing.\u201d The bulk of Democrat\u2019s gains this cycle came in suburban areas where the party previously felt gerrymandered out of contention. In many of those red-tinged or purple districts incoming lawmakers have already vowed to oppose Pelosi, and it will be difficult to change tack.  Read: 21 historic firsts from the 2018 midterms\u201cI\u2019ve been talking for over a year and a half about how critical new leadership is, how gridlocked Washington is, and how important it is that we move forward on these key issues,\u201d incoming New Jersey Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill said outside of an orientation meeting. \u201cI think the best way to do that is with new leaders.\u201d As Pelosi and her confidants are twisting arms and doling out favors to win more support, many of those \"Never Pelosi\" Democrats are wavering on their pledge to voters to oppose her, which has some Democrats warning the entire party\u2019s credibility is at stake if she\u2019s named speaker. \u201cWhen you say something and you tell people something, you should keep your word,\u201d incoming Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who still steadfastly vows to never support Pelosi, told reporters at the Capitol. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t keep your word, that just diminishes, I believe, what the public believes about elected officials.\u201d The danger for Sherrill, Drew and any other freshman who opposes Pelosi is they imperil their own fundraising ability if she is re-elected. Indeed, part of the reason Democrats were able to flip 33 Republican seats (so far) this year was due to Pelosi\u2019s fundraising prowess. The bulk of that cash was sent to the very freshman lawmakers who are now imperiling her leadership aspirations. While Pelosi\u2019s detractors are the most vocal, the bulk of House Democrats are firmly behind her (at least publicly), and that includes the majority of the party\u2019s freshmen class. \u201cNancy Pelosi has proven herself as a first-class legislator,\u201d soon-to-be Florida Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who was secretary of Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, told a flock of reporters huddled in the cold outside of the hotel reserved for freshmen lawmakers. \u201cWe would not have Obamacare without her.\u201d Pelosi and her allies inside and outside of Congress continue to lobby the freshman class to get behind her bid, but for more than a few freshmen, all this talk of the party leader is premature. Besides trying to figure out how to navigate the sprawling Capitol complex, many also want to get to know Pelosi\u2019s top generals and lieutenants before casting their lot with her. Ilhan Omar, who will become the first Somali-American member of Congress when she takes office in January, served as assistant minority leader in Minnesota\u2019s legislature, has not yet decided on Pelosi.But she knows from firsthand experience that the figurehead at the top of the party can\u2019t accomplish anything on their own. \u201cNobody does anything by themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s weakness is someone else\u2019s strength, and someone else\u2019s strength is someone else\u2019s weakness.\u201dCover: Members-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., left, and Deb Haaland, D-N.M., are seen after the freshman class photo on the East Front of the Capitol on November 14, 2018.
