{"id": "Stream of the Crop: 12 New Albums for Heavy Rotation", "paragraph": "L:\u00a0Gregg DeGuire/Getty ImagesR:\u00a0C Flanigan/Getty ImagesEvery week, the Noisey staff puts together a list of the best and most important albums, mixtapes, and EPs from the past seven days. Sometimes it includes projects we\u2019ve written about on the site already; sometimes it's just made up of great records that we want everyone to hear, but never got the chance to write about. The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.In 21 minutes, Khalid goes from American Teen to a journey of manhood on Suncity. The Texas singer\u2019s velvety vocals are effortless on tracks like \u201cVertigo\u201d and \u201cSaturday Nights,\u201d but he finds what are likely to be his next commercial hits at the tail-end of Suncity. \u201cBetter\u201d and the title track find Khalid back in his role as American latest R&B heartthrob. \u2014Kristin CorryThese faux-gritty moments on  Nuthin' 2 Prove seem particularly strange because business is booming for Yachty these days, and much of his commercial success appears to have come as a result of his breeziness. He was the face of Sprite in 2016; he covered \"It Takes Two\" with Carly Rae Jepsen and Mike Will Made-It for a Target campaign last year; in what seemed to be a Mad Libs-generated snapshot of music in 2018, he collaborated with Donny Osmond for a goddamned Chef Boyardee commercial. I'm assuming that the execs behind those deals didn't put contracts in front of Yachty because they were looking for the next-best thing after 21 Savage turned them down. I imagine they wanted the guy who could convincingly rap the line \"positivity is what made us famous\" while standing next to a Canadian pop star. \u2014Alex Robert RossIn one of his earlier interviews, Tom Krell spoke about a kinship he felt to makers of harsh, atonal, performative music. \u201cIf the ethos of noise is just to throw yourself out there spiritually, to visibly rend yourself in public, then there should be a recognized commonality between what Prurient does and [what I do],\u201d he said. That streak for emotionally and conceptual wooliness hasn\u2019t been as obvious in the work he\u2019s made over his last couple of records, but he returns to the haze that birthed him on his new record  The Anteroom. It\u2019s by and large a creeping and quiet record, full of unraveling samples, ghostly poetics, and the distant skitter of hi-hats from a distant warehouse raves. It\u2019s not noise, but it further underscores the point he was making in that comparison, if you\u2019re really willing to open yourself up spiritually, strange stuff can leak out. \u2014Colin JoyceUs is a lighter listen than what\u2019s come before, and it feels more polished and expansive than her debut. The whole thing is full of glorious airy pop sounds, her lithe, lilting vocals guiding us through life\u2019s adversities like the light waves of a lake. Take single \u201cTrust Me Baby,\u201d which sees her imploring \u201cWe could do each other more love than harm / If you just, you just trust me, baby\u201d over shiny, luxurious clouds of synth. Written down, it sounds like a troubled, frustrated request\u2014but through it\u2019s breezy delivery,  Us finds Rodriguez more at ease and, well, happier. \u2014Shaad D'Souza, Empress Of Took a Step Back and Reinvented Her Pop SoundCloud Nothings are heavier, meaner, quicker, punchier, and more vital here, on their fifth LP, than they've ever been before. Dylan Baldi has rediscovered the fury that gave  Attack on Memory and  Here and Nowhere Else their nihilistic power; Jayson Gerycz is once again the most propulsive and energetic drummer in modern rock music; their verses kick and scream; their choruses are immediate. And don't get me wrong here\u2014I liked 2016  Life Without Sound, the first album on which Baldi actually worked on his lyrics and picked himself apart. I'm just glad that he's managed to meld that thoughtfulness with some righteous anger and breakneck melodies again. Lines that'll stick with you forever after just one listen: \"They won't remember my name / I'll be alone in my shame,\" \"Don't give him your / Don't give him your life if it's not right,\" \"I wish I could believe in your dream.\" \u2014Alex Robert RossJessie Reyez is only at war with herself\u2014or at least that\u2019s what it sounds like on \u201cSaint Nobody,\u201d the opener of her debut album Being Human in Public. After releasing Kiddo and a string of loose singles, the Toronto singer is approaching R&B with a \u201cby any means necessary\u201d mentality. \u201cIf tomorrow never comes, I\u2019ve got my gun\u2019s loaded,\u201d she sings. Reyez carries the brash attitude of a rapper in her lyrics like when she details relationships on \u201cFuck Being Friends.\u201d \u201cI got your heart in my hand and your dick in the other / You ain\u2019t scared to fuck, but you\u2019re scared to be lovers,\u201d she sings. Being Human in Public is a balancing act of vulnerability and nonchalance and Jessie Reyez teeters that line just fine.\u2014Kristin CorrySummer Walker has the type of voice that sounds like a rainy Sunday afternoon. It hugs you, but not too tight, and leaves plenty of space for reflection. On \u201cGirls Need Love,\u201d a single questioning the connotations behind a woman requesting affection, Walker takes a SZA approach to her songwriting: frank as hell. She doesn\u2019t coat her lyrics in colorful prose, and that\u2019s what makes Last Day of Summer feel as agonizing as the first day the fall breeze tickles your neck. \u201cPrayed Up\u201d is a checklist of the methods she uses to cope, like smoking, drinking, or sex, but remembering that staying in prayer is what ultimately keeps her demons at ease. Her 28-minute debut are excerpts to the diary of a woman who isn\u2019t afraid to admit she\u2019s flawed. \u2014Kristin CorryIn the shadow of Guy Fieri\u2019s Smokehouse, a few hundred attendees\u2014mostly white, working class folks of all ages\u2014cheer on the matches leading up to Eagle vs. Jonze. The smell of chicken tenders and pulled pork is pervasive. I hear a wrestler unironically call someone \"brother.\" It\u2019s humid from a harsh summer storm, and the scene is confusing as ticket-holders struggle to find seats while the spectacle captures the attention of passersby\u2014 visiting business people and tourists\u2014who stop to gawk from the sidewalk and wonder what they\u2019ve stumbled upon. \u2014Michelle Eigenheer, Inside Open Mike Eagle's Wild, Sweaty Pro Wrestling DebutPer the title, Famous Eno\u2019s debut for Manchester dancefloor futurists Swing Ting is a functional and ecstatic set of pure sundown heat. Enlisting a crew of trusted collaborators from around the world of the kick drum contortionism that gets lumped under the umbrella of \u201cclub music,\u201d Eno twists on tropes from Jersey, Jamaica, London, and elsewhere to broadcast his utopian vision of dance music in the internet era. It\u2019s pretty hype, is what I\u2019m saying. \u2014Colin JoyceA new prank/project from the proprietors of the Chicago label Hausu Mountain promises \u201cmusic\u201d (quotation marks theirs) made from \u201croughly 420,000 samples\u201d (blaze it). The title stands for \u201dEcstatic Dissonant Mashup\u201d which hints at what you\u2019re getting here: quasi-tonal sample-slurries that are equal parts Youtube Poop and proper plunderphonics. You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll cry, you\u2019ll get kinda dizzy, and then throw up rainbows or some shit. I would say buyer beware, but the tape\u2019s only a dollar so you can\u2019t really go wrong. \u2014Colin JoyceThe two trash-pop upstarts Rook and Girls Rituals proved on their team-up earlier this year as Black Dresses that they\u2019re uniquely talented at excavating trauma and turning the worst shit the world has to offer into noise that\u2019s as infectious and upsetting, like a pair of cheerleaders chanting at a funeral. Their latest EP sinks their talons in deeper, offering moments both catchier (the grinning rave-up \u201cSEXY VAMPIRE\u201d) and more crushing (the stuttering, scuffed, phlegm smeared title track). A working thesis statement for the whole freaked-out nature of the Black Dresses project is screamed by Rook on \u201cU DONT KNOW\u201d: \u201cyeah I'm so cute and scared and small, but I\u2019m not FUCKING OKAY.\u201d \u2014Colin JoyceFollow Noisey on Twitter.Get the best of Noisey, delivered to your inbox every day."}
