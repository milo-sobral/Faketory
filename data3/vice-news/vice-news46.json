{"id": "charity kase\u2019s extreme horror drag will haunt your nightmares ", "paragraph": "Imagery via ChaCharity Kase\u2019s Instagram feed is so terrifying it needs a trigger warning. Whether channelling Nosferatu realness, giving Pennywise the clown a run for his money, or ruining all our childhoods as a twisted version of Winnie the Pooh, the 21-year-old drag queen\u2019s looks are horrifically good. Think less  RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, more  Drag Me To Hell. While most young drag performers ease into the art form with more feminine or pretty looks, Charity Kase, real name Harry Whitfield, always wanted his looks to be decidedly spookier. \u201cI love anything twisted and beautiful so I\u2019ve always been drawn to horror and animation,\u201d Charity says. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by dark fantasy and mythical creatures, and also by the idea that you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover, so I try to show depth and beauty in my less commercially attractive looks. Growing up I always loved witches, gremlins and fairies because they were always the strongest and most interesting characters. Now I\u2019m simply one of them!\u201d While Charity\u2019s looks aren\u2019t \u201ccommercially attractive,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t championing their own version of beauty. Sure, it\u2019s horrible beauty, but it\u2019s beauty nonetheless, and each look requires an incredible amount of time and effort to achieve. Last year, the performer, who also runs his own clothing line, participated in Instagram\u2019s 365 Days of Drag challenge, which required them to perfect an intricate, creative, and suitably terrifying look every single day. \u201cIt was an on the spot decision on the 1st of January to do it,\u201d explains Charity, who then spent three to seven hours every single day creating the looks, which included a chilling Krampus, a bushy browed Hermione Granger and even a nightmarish Gretchen from Disney classic  Recess. Drag is an expensive hobby -- dresses, headpieces, and makeup don\u2019t come cheap, especially when you need a new one every single day -- but Charity works on a budget, hence the name. \u201cIn hindsight, I probably could have used some preparation time. It was a really intense experience. I spent so much money on costumes and dresses in the past year but luckily a few makeup brands helped me out!\u201dScrolling through each of the 365 looks though is all the inspiration you need for your Halloween costume this year. An expert in the spookiest night of the year, Charity hosts makeup tutorials on his YouTube channel, but as far as Halloween is concerned, they tell i-D their advice is go big or go home. \u201cWhen it comes to Halloween, the bloodier the better,\u201d Charity says. \u201cThe worst costume is definitely Donald Trump though. However demonic and orange and tempting it might be, nobody wants to be reminded of that on a night out.\u201d  You can catch Charity tonight, teaching a Halloween make-up workshop at the Sarabande Foundation.
