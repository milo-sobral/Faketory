Lots and lots of money. In this third installment of the four-part web series \u201cShe\u2019s Running,\u201d DeJear, Kim, Eskamani, and Zegers must survive debates, raise voters\u2019 awareness, and cajole donors into opening their checkbooks. Two of their opponents are experienced incumbents, which makes all that even harder. All these women\u2019s canvassing, their fundraising, their sign waving, their speech making, their cow milking, their porkchop flipping, their weeks and months and years of campaigning \u2014 all of it came down to just one day. Watch the final installment of VICE News\u2019 \u201cShe\u2019s Running\u201d web series to find out what happened next."}
