{"id": "Flight Attendants Questioned a Black Doctor for Helping a Sick Passenger", "paragraph": "Photo of Stanford via her Twitter; photo of a Delta plane by Flickr user\u00a0Tom\u00e1s Del Coro Earlier this week, Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford was on a Delta flight from Indianapolis to Boston when she noticed something was wrong with the passenger sitting next to her. Given that she is, you know, a doctor and all, she started to help the person\u2014but for some reason, the flight attendants onboard apparently thought there was something suspicious about that. According to the  New York Times, a stewardess came over and asked her if she was a doctor. Stanford said that, yes, she was\u2014she's a registered physician in Massachusetts\u2014and she handed the woman her medical license, unprompted. She told the  Times that she'd made a habit of carrying it with her after reading about Dr. Tamika Cross, a black physician who was asked for her credentials while trying to assist a passenger on another Delta flight back in 2016.  According to Stanford, yet another flight attendant then came over and asked to see her medical license, which she gave her. Apparently satisfied, the attendant left\u2014only to come back with the first attendant in tow. They both started questioning Stanford. \u201cAre you a head doctor?\u201d one asked. \u201cAre you actually an MD?\u201d  \u201cIs this your license?\u201d the other attendant asked, according to Stanford\u2014to which she replied, \u201cWhy would I carry someone else\u2019s medical license?\u201d  As Stanford saw it, this was a pretty blatant case of racial profiling. She\u2019d proven to two separate flight attendants that she was a doctor two separate times, and still, somehow, they had doubts about her credentials\u2014just like they\u2019d had about Cross\u2019s. \u201cThis is something that the medical community has embraced as a reality. When you Google a doctor, most of the pictures that come up are of a white man,\u201d Stanford told the  Times. \u201cThere are other people who look like me. And I should not be called into question about something I have worked for my entire life.\u201d Delta has since apologized to Stanford in an email and said that it\u2019s conducting an investigation into the situation. But her uncomfortable run-in with those flight attendants is now about something bigger than just one flight: It brought the #WhatADoctorLooksLike conversation back into focus. Cross, the physician who had a similar experience back in 2016, wrote on Facebook about what she sees as a clear lack of progress around the issue.  \u201cIn 2016, you did not believe I looked like a doctor either,\u201d her post reads. \u201cHundreds of thousands of us across this country and even in other countries banded together to show you #whatadoctorlookslike but here we stand JUST 2 years later and your employees have not learned.\u201d Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.
