{"id": "Game Developers Give Advice On How To Make Their Industry a Better Place", "paragraph": "Image courtesy of Rockstar GamesOne of the most common questions I\u2019ve heard since Telltale Games imploded without paying severance to hundreds of employees and a combination of perplexing admissions and in-depth reporting unearthed a culture of crunch within Rockstar Games is understandable: Is it possible to buy and enjoy games by these companies, given everything we now know?The most common answer is: \u201cWell, don\u2019t buy the game. Vote with your wallet, and send a message!\u201d Except it\u2019s not that simple. On one hand, the popularity of these games, especially  Red Dead Redemption 2, means any boycott is unlikely to be large enough to materially impact the bottom line of the bad actors involved to prove a point. Secondly, Kotaku reported employee bonuses are tied up in the game\u2019s financial success, meaning any real boycott would end up financially undermining the very people you\u2019re trying to help.But...that doesn\u2019t take it off the table. In the same way one person recycling every day won\u2019t individually alter the temperature of the planet, it can still be the right thing to do  for you. It all depends on where you draw the line. Did Telltale go too far? Did Rockstar? We all have our own individual priorities that, by design, put some problems above others; the world is fucked in more ways than one, and it\u2019s impossible to live life without ethical compromise. You do not become a bad person for participating in a flawed system you did not build yourself, but it\u2019s also incumbent on you to find ways to push back or improve that very same system.We talked through this problem on an emergency podcast today.Separately, on Twitter, I flipped this question to developers.The answers varied, but shared a common theme: buy and enjoy the games built by them, even if you come to realize the circumstances they were developed may have been harmful.\u201cI would prefer someone just play whatever they want and then vote for folks who will lead the way on progressive, future of work issues,\u201d said Campo Santo ( Firewatch) co-founder Sean Vanaman, who previously worked at Telltale Games. \u201cIn the case of [Telltale Games] I\u2019d already given much of myself making the game under difficult circumstances. I think it\u2019s ok to participate as a customer in a broken system if you do so eyes-open and advocate consistently over the long term for improvements to the system, but it\u2019s a matter of unique perspective, I might feel differently had I stayed at [Telltale Games] through the end.\u201dVoting is important. There\u2019s a distressingly important midterm election in a few weeks, actually. Please vote! But voting, like buying or not buying an ethically compromised product, can feel empty; it comes at the  end of the process. Voting isn\u2019t activism, and there\u2019s a difference between the two. Activism is finding ways to empower a local candidate pressing issues in a direction you think would make the world better. Activism is showing up to a local chapter of an issue or political party, and seeing what you can do to help. Small steps matter.\u201cBuy the game and have fun playing it,\u201d said Iron Galaxy (Divekick) CEO Dave Lang, whose studio has previously disclosed they routinely turn away business deals that would have their studio working excessive hours. \u201cFor me I just don\u2019t think this will be an effective form of protest, so putting myself in the shoes of the dev team I\u2019d just assume see people enjoying the things I\u2019ve worked on, even if the circumstances I worked on were shit.\u201dThis came up over and over, in conversations both private and public with developers who responded to my tweet. Many are proud of the work they did, despite the circumstances, and that pushing back on labor conditions is a fight never ending\u2014but it must happen  earlier.\u201cThis isn't a thing you can punish at the register,\u201d said No Goblin (100ft Robot Golf) founder Dan Teasdale. \u201cBuy and enjoy the work that's done by developers, but don't support or give a platform to the industry organizations and foundations that downplay negative quality of life policies.\u201dThough Teasdale doesn\u2019t point to any organization specifically, it\u2019s easy to imagine he\u2019s talking the Entertainment Software Association, a group ostensibly representing the \u201cindustry,\u201d but in reality, it\u2019s an advocacy group for the biggest publishers. When Waypoint asked now-former ESA president Mike Gallagher about crunch at E3, he said they were \u201clistening,\u201d but refused to outline any specific steps it was taking to better labor conditions.\u201cAsking players to \u2018suffer\u2019 (not play a game they want to play) for injustices they have no personal stake in will never work,\u201d said designer Tyler Glaiel (The End is Nigh), \u201cbut you can convince people to buy games from developers that don't do those things instead, and buy those at full price instead of waiting for sales.\u201dThis is an underappreciated point of empowerment. Rather than avoiding buying games from companies that insult your personal values,  do buy them from places that compliment them.Another note: if a developer has a game listed on Steam, itch.io, and a personal website, buy it anywhere but Steam. Sure, yes, Steam is a useful tool and it\u2019s nice to have your games in a single spot, but itch.io gives developers greater flexibility in profit margins, and on a personal website, nearly all of it goes to them. For smaller developers, the dollars add up. Other forms of economic reinforcement include supporting creators on Patreon\u2014or tipping.You may not have much money, though. OK, what then? This sounds crude, but it\u2019s true: tell them you love the work they do. You\u2019d be surprised how far a positive thought goes in 2018.\u201cMy take is that boycotting sales won't make a dent in projects of this magnitude,\u201d said Overkill (The Walking Dead) systems designer Miodrag Kovachevic. \u201cIf players want to help, call out companies and higher-ups every time all the time something like this happens. Attack it with the same fervor that's used for Season Passes, DLCs, etc.\u201dThere hasn\u2019t been nearly the same fervor around the treatment of labor than there has around, say, loot boxes. Loot boxes are terrible and exploitative, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the incendiary discussion around loot boxes actually nudged some companies in a way we\u2019ve yet to meaningfully see with crunch practices. You\u2019ll notice Kovachevic\u2019s examples all riff on the same thing: players being asked to spend more money. There\u2019s less fervor around labor because it isn\u2019t personally localized; it happens to  other people, thus demanding empathy.Again, there\u2019s no clear path out of this. Unionization would help. And activism. And better labor regulations. There is no ideal, utopian world\u2014only a less flawed one. That it seems insurmountable is not an excuse to throw up your hands, hand over a credit card, and do nothing. Find ways\u2014on a daily basis, on a game-by-game basis\u2014to move the ball forward. You, like many other people, may buy  Red Dead Redemption 2. I will be one of those people. But if you do, go in with eyes open.In other words:Follow Patrick on Twitter.
