{"id": "Vegan Fined $1,025 for Threatening to Stab Mom Over Simmering Meat Sauce", "paragraph": "Photo: Getty Images Imagining opening the door to your apartment, and following your nose straight into the kitchen where your mother is making a slow-simmering ragu Bolognese from the kind of traditional recipe that has probably never been written down. What do you do? Do you ask if she wants you to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the heavy pot? Do you pick up her worn wooden spoon to get an in-progress taste? Or do you threaten to stab her in the stomach because GODDAMMIT, WHAT\u2019S WITH THE MEAT, MA?  According to  The Telegraph, a woman in Modena, Italy, went with the latter, because she\u2019s vegan and apparently believed that her mother should\u2019ve known better than to cook animal flesh in her presence. The unidentified woman went into a straight-up rage because of the Bolognese, upset that her nasal passages had been exposed to animal products. She picked up a kitchen knife and reportedly shouted (the equivalent of): \u201cIf you won\u2019t stop on your own then I\u2019ll make you stop! Quit making rag\u00f9, or I\u2019ll stab you in the stomach!\u201d  The unemployed 48-year-old reportedly told the court that it had been ages since she\u2019d had \u201csensory or olfactory contact\u201d with meats\u2014at least until she moved back in with her mother. (Consequently, her mother said that this wasn\u2019t the first time that her daughter had gotten aggressive about butter, cream, milk, or meat.)  The woman\u2019s mother seems to make from-scratch meals in the tradition of the  rezdore. Modena is part of the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy, where previous generations grew up with a  rezdora, a local term for a Boss Bitch who managed the home, kept her family in line, and also managed to make her own pasta.  \u201cThe  rezdora was not simply \u2018the housewife,\u2019 but represented so much more,\u201d Italian magazine  Non Solo Buono wrote. \u201cFollowing changes in society and the disappearance of the traditional peasant patriarchal family, the  rezdora as described is disappearing, but the term is still used to indicate a good wife and a great cook. The rezdora is a mythologized, beloved figure, sometimes envied by those who don\u2019t have one at home anymore.\u201d  But, sometimes the  rezdora is threatened with a knife because of her Bolognese sauce. Attorneys for both sides had tried to mediate this case for the past two years, with no success. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of the mother, and ordered the younger woman to pay a \u20ac400 ($456) fine and \u20ac500 ($570) in compensation. If she hasn\u2019t done it already, now\u2019s probably a good time to move out, too. Subscribe to Munchies."}
