In one video, a Proud Boy is heard bragging about kicking a \u201cforeigner\u201d in the head. The incident prompted an outcry from state and city officials, who condemned the Proud Boys and urged the NYPD \u2014 which was initially criticized for not doing enough to protect protesters \u2014 to investigate and arrest the violent instigators. In the aftermath of the clashes, the NYPD arrested three anti-fascist demonstrators who were protesting McInnes\u2019 speech but did not immediately arrest any Proud Boys. Disclosure: The Proud Boys organization was founded by Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of VICE Media. McInnes left VICE in 2008 and has not been involved in the company since.
