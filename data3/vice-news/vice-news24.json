It\u2019s a few hours before the show in New York, and Scott is sat backstage in a gray hoodie and matching track pants with a mash-up of the MTV and Moschino logos on. It\u2019s this kind of surreal, pop cultural collision that has won the designer his legion of fans he\u2019s talking about. \u201cI want for them to enjoy it, and to get the most iconic, non-diluted vision of my world. I want them to have a Jeremy Scott for Moschino collection 100%, and not one drop of water added to it,\u201d and he pauses, looking for the word. \u201cLike,  potent,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cNot like, \u2018Oh I have the lesser priced one.\u2019 I want them to have it, because it is it! It came from my voice, from my loins! It\u2019s genuine, and stuff I want to wear, and give to my wear, and see people in. It\u2019s authentic.\u201d Scott\u2019s work is routed in fantasy, as are his shows \u2014 recent visions for both his own label, and Moschino, have included a trip to the circus, an artist\u2019s studio, Los Angeles, and a planet populated by glamorous aliens. This time, however, he\u2019s visiting somewhere closer to home. New York, Times Square to be exact, the place with a million people looking at billboards. Only Scott could find the beauty in such a place. \u201cI loved the idea of Times Square,\u201d he says gleefully. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s so many people there. You can run into anything or anybody. I wanted it to have this feel of, \u2018Who\u2019s that cool person walking by you on the street looking so amazing.\u2019\u201d That energy will be seen in the staging of the show, too. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the vibe of the show, you have a cityscape, billboards with imagery we created, visual screens with all the imagery we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s this multi layered environment.\u201d Of course, any imagining of New York wouldn\u2019t be replete without a dose of the underground (it\u2019s still there). You can see it in the campaign, shot by Steven Meisel \u2014 half of which is in a couture salon, the other half of which takes place at a vogue ball. \u201cThe couture and ball worlds are symbiotic, and Steven was so into it and inspired by it that it made perfect sense,\u201d says Scott. You can see Scott himself peering out from the back of the ball, which in part was inspired by his favorite TV show of the moment,  Pose. In fact, MJ Rodriguez, who stars in the show as Bianca, features in the lookbook alongside the designer. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve watched every episode several times. I\u2019m so thrilled they have a second season. MJ and India will be there tonight,\u201d no doubt just two of many celebrity appearances. \u201cShe is a phenomenal talent, she can convey so much emotion and nuance with a glance. She\u2019s so wonderfully gentle and cool. We started chatting and getting to know each other. To bring her in there and shine a light on her, I thought was important.\u201d  The campaign, and lookbook, are in fact packed with Scott\u2019s friends, who he considers his extended family (his actual family also attend all his shows). It\u2019s diverse, not in a tokenistic way, but in gender expression, race, and size, with everyone from the aforementioned MJ, to  Drag Race star Aquaria, to model Barbie Ferreira, to tattooed actress Bria Vinaite from  The Florida Project. \u201cProbably, as opposed to perhaps some designers, I\u2019m someone that naturally shows diversity,\u201d he muses of his group. \u201cDiversity is genuinely a part of my life, versus other brands, so if anything perhaps H&M were surprised that they didn\u2019t have to encourage me in that,\u201d he says of the casting process. With this many friends, his phone, currently in an oversize Moschino case, must be blowing up nonstop.  \u201cMy phone\u2019s exhausted,\u201d he laughs uproariously. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Please stop it.\u2019\u201d the chance of Scott ever slowing down, however, is close to nil. Moschino x H&M launches November 8 at select stores worldwide and online at HM.com. Watch the fashion show live tonight at 7pm EST on Instagram.suscribe to i-D's positive vibes."}
