{"id": "Should You Warn Your Ex's New Partner They're An Abuser?", "paragraph": "Illustration by Calum Heath Every year, women are killed by stalkers and domestic abusers\u2014despite previously reporting them to the police. Unfollow Me is a campaign from Broadly to highlight the under-reported issue of stalking and domestic abuse in support of anti-stalking charity Paladin's calls to introduce a Stalkers Register in the UK. Follow all of our coverage here.Rachel\u2019s ex-boyfriend Dan had been stalking her for months when suddenly, this September, he stopped. \u201cAt first I was thought,  this is amazing,\u201d the 27-year-old, from London, says. \u201cThen one of my friends saw on Instagram that he had got a new girlfriend. I felt intensely worried.\u201dRachel and Dan had been in a relationship for two years before separating in May. (All the names of survivors in the piece have been changed to protect their safety.) He would call her names and tell her that she\u2019d embarrassed him after they\u2019d been on nights out together. At one point he threw her against a wall. \u201cHe was good at making me feel like I had no other options and that the way I was being treated was my fault,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re told that you\u2019re stupid over and over again, you just think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m stupid\u2019.\u201d Eventually Rachel managed to leave the relationship, but Dan began stalking her. He phoned her relentlessly, and contacted her boss and every member of her family. He logged into her Facebook and threatened to attack people that she was messaging. He even sent her a fake Paypal request so that she had to reply or pay him money. Rachel contacted police to get a harassment order against him. Then, out of the blue, it ended.Watch: Unfollow Me: The Story of Alice RugglesRachel believes that the only reason Dan stopped harassing her was because he found another woman to direct his abuse towards. She wanted to warn her, and began to draft messages to send to her on Instagram. \u201cOne outlined what he'd done to me. It was rambling and ugly,\u201d she says. \u201cThe one that I was closer to sending was more of an olive branch. It let her know that, if he was doing, or saying dehumanizing things, I\u2019d experienced that too and she wasn't alone.\u201dShe never sent the messages. \u201cMy friends all said it was dangerous and might inflame him to contact me further,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get it. It definitely felt like it was my responsibility. I had information that might have spared her from the experience I had. It was overwhelming at times.\u201d While Rachel\u2019s friends might not have understood the responsibility she felt for Dan\u2019s new girlfriend, many domestic abuse and stalking survivors do. Survivor\u2019s guilt haunts victims long after their own trauma starts to fade. It\u2019s a sense that the safety of their ex\u2019s next partner rests on their shoulders. Stalking survivors told Broadly that their emotions include guilt,anxiety, and even nausea. They explained that these feelings add an extra layer of trauma to the self-recrimination and shame left by the abuse. It\u2019s easy to see why victims might feel like gatekeepers for their ex-partner\u2019s behavior, even after their relationships end: although, of course, it isn\u2019t their responsibility to do so. Thanks to social media, it\u2019s never been easier to keep tabs on an abusive former partner, and know when they begin dating someone new\u2014and contact that partner at the click of a button. A 2015-2016 UK government review estimated that there were more than 25,000 serial perpetrators of domestic abuse and stalking in the UK. Currently, police can do very little to warn future victims until it\u2019s too late. This is because police don\u2019t proactively identify and monitor serial abusers, relying instead on each victim to report individual cases of abuse as a crime. It\u2019s no surprise that survivors end up in a Catch-22: risk their safety by contacting the new partner, or live with the guilt that comes from saying nothing. While Rachel is only just coming to terms with her own abuse, Grace has been trying to process her survivor\u2019s guilt for more than a year. The 25-year-old Londoner started going out with her boss, Jason when she was 21. He was 15 years older. At first, he seemed loving and caring, but then he began to control what she ate and sexually abused her. When they broke up in 2016, he sent her texts and emails for six months. \u201cHe finally said he would cut his wrists if I didn't call him, so I called an ambulance,\u201d she says. \u201cThey went to his house with a police car and found him happily playing video games. He was arrested and given a caution for harassing me. I haven't heard from him since.\u201dWhen Grace found out that Jason was seeing someone new, she tried to put it out of her mind. Counselling helped, but it didn\u2019t quell her survivor\u2019s guilt. \u201cFor the past year, I\u2019ve felt very anxious about his new girlfriend again. I think about her a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel a responsibility to tell her about his history because the police aren\u2019t in a position to do it, and I feel confident my ex isn\u2019t going to.\u201d But Grace is worried that she\u2019ll either make things worse for his new partner or that the woman will already be gaslit\u2014like she was\u2014into thinking the relationship is perfect. It\u2019s something Rachel reiterates: \u201cI like to think I would have been grateful if Dan\u2019s ex-girlfriend had reached out to me. But I don\u2019t know that. When we first started going out, he said they broke up because his ex was crazy.\u201dGrace and Rachel are right to worry about the consequences of reaching out to their ex\u2019s new partner, and to question whether they\u2019d even be believed if they did. Laura Richards of anti-stalking charity Paladin warns: \u201cThe inherent dangers are not being believed, not being validated, and it coming down onto you. There\u2019s always a risk with these individuals because they are the most dangerous of cases.\u201dIt can be a re-traumatizing experience if a survivor does reach out to a new partner only to be dismissed. Lauren, who is 47 and lives in the west of England, tried to warn her ex James\u2019s new partner about the 11 years of domestic abuse he inflicted on her and her children. When Lauren and James first started dating in 2004 he seemed like the perfect boyfriend. Things changed once she got pregnant. \u201cOne night he tipped me out of bed on to the floor,\u201d she says. One day in 2015, James told Lauren he\u2019d met someone else. She was in the process of leaving the relationship, and had already convinced him to move out. Lauren contacted James\u2019 new girlfriend to warn her. \u201cWhen we did talk on the phone I told her that James had been cautioned for domestic abuse,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was dismissive. She replied that he\u2019d already told her and that she thought he was really honest. He\u2019d told her that I was nuts and that I would be calling her.\u201d  For More Stories Like This, Sign Up for Our NewsletterTara, 21, from Cambridge, says that she ignored her abusive boyfriend\u2019s ex when she tried to warn her about his behavior. \u201cI laughed it off,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had told me she was a jealous ex who kept messaging him begging to get back with her, and I believed him. We broke up a year later, and I finally was able to fully understand what she was saying. She wasn't just a \u2018crazy ex\u2019, she was genuinely warning me about his controlling behaviour and tendency towards assault.\u201d She says that knowing how she reacted at the time makes her hesitant to tell his new girlfriend about his behavior. \u201cI feel powerless because I can't help or warn her,\u201d Tara says. \u201cI have no reason to think that she would listen to me or believe me.\u201dSo, what\u2019s the solution? Advocates for survivors say the responsibility to warn future partners shouldn\u2019t lie with survivors. \u201cIf you are kicking open the hornet's nest and trying to warn somebody else,\u201d Richards says, \u201cyou want a safer way of doing it and for it to be a police-related forum.\u201d She believes that only legislation can shift the responsibility from survivors to police and probation services. A Stalkers Register would require police to keep tabs on known serial abusers and warn new partners of their past behavior. Not only would it allow future victims to be protected from harm before it happened\u2014it would help survivors no longer feel obligated to put themselves in a position that compromised their safety. And a Stalkers Register, she says, wouldn\u2019t just have possibly prevented women like Lauren and Grace from entering relationships with abusive men: it would also ease their survivor\u2019s guilt. Lauren says that she wouldn\u2019t have warned her abuser\u2019s new partner if she\u2019d known that the police would contact her. For Grace, \u201cit would remove the sense of responsibility that I feel for Jason\u2019s new girlfriend. It would be liberating.\u201d For now, all survivors can do is hope that their ex\u2019s new partners aren\u2019t suffering as they once did. Rachel thinks about Dan\u2019s new girlfriend often: \u201cI still feel guilty. I still think that I should say something.\u201d Get your horoscope in your inbox, every day."}
