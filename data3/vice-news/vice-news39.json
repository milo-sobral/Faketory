{"id": "What we know about the bombs sent to Trump's biggest critics", "paragraph": "Watch VICE News Tonight on HBO weekdays at 7:30.At least six bombs targeting high-profile liberal figures were delivered over the last 48 hours, sending shockwaves down the spine of the Acela corridor as the Trump administration\u2019s violent invective manifested in what officials are calling an act of terror. The scare began Tuesday, when authorities discovered a pipe bomb left in the mailbox of Democratic donor George Soros in Katonah, New York. Late Tuesday night, Secret Service agents charged with sorting mail discovered an explosive device addressed to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s home in Chappaqua, New York. The next morning, agents discovered another bomb, addressed to former President Barack Obama\u2019s office in Washington D.C. Hours later, CNN\u2019s New York headquarters were evacuated after an explosive device addressed to former CIA director John Brennan, a frequent contributor to the network, was discovered in a mailroom. The offices of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, were also evacuated Wednesday after receiving a package containing an explosive device. According to NBC, the package was originally addressed to former Attorney General Eric Holder, but was undeliverable and rerouted to Wasserman Schultz, whose office was listed as the package\u2019s return address. Reports also indicate a bomb addressed to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters was intercepted by Capitol Hill police at a Congressional mail processing center. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also said he had been targeted with a suspicious package, though that claim \u2014 and another suggesting the White House was a target \u2014 was later debunked.John Miller, the head of the NYPD\u2019s counterterrorism unit, said Wednesday that the bombs addressed to CNN, Obama, Clinton, Soros, and possibly others, appeared to be sent by the same person. He says his office and the FBI are both investigating the bombs as a pattern. The recipients of the bombs are all frequent targets of right-wing conspiracies, though authorities have so far declined to speculate on the bomb makers\u2019 specific motive.

He says his office and the FBI are both investigating the bombs as a pattern. The recipients of the bombs are all frequent targets of right-wing conspiracies, though authorities have so far declined to speculate on the bomb makers\u2019 specific motive. In a speech Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump made assurances that thorough investigations into the devices were underway. \u201cThe safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe full weight of our government is being deployed to bring these despicable acts to justice.Trump also called for unity, saying, \u201cThreats and political violence of any kind has no place in the United States of America.\"Law enforcement agencies have described the devices as functional but rudimentary. Photos of the device sent to CNN reveal what appears to be a small pipe bomb with electrical and battery components. Experts say the bombs are likely the work of an amateur bomb maker who probably learned how to make explosives from the internet, and warn that this pattern will probably continue for at least a few days. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the ability to create panic without killing or hurting anybody. These are crude, small devices.\u201d said Scott Stewart, a former U.S. State Department special agent who now supervises terrorism and security issues for Stratfor, a global intelligence firm. \u201cThis is about terror, and the messaging. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for those devices to kill someone. Badly injure, maybe, but certainly not enough to take down a building.\u201d Investigators will be be looking for what\u2019s known as the \u201cbomb maker\u2019s signature,\u201d or, in other words, \u201cHow the connections were made, how they were assembled, what was the activation device, was the recipe something taken off the internet,\u201d said Stewart. Investigators will also carry out forensic testing on the devices, looking for things like microscopic DNA traces, and tracking down where the particular components were purchased. They may also be looking for other evidentiary indicators, like whether there was a letter sent alongside the devices. \u201cBecause this appears to have a political motive, I\u2019m sure the FBI is combing protective intelligence databases for threats against these particular individuals,\u201d said Stewart. Former FBI special agent Jeff Danik said the bombs \u201ccould be a very dangerous situation\u201d depending on how functional they are. The real concern would be if the person behind the explosives switches to a \u201csofter target,\u201d since all the recipients so far have extensive security protections and mail screening systems that identified the bombs before they were delivered. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see more devices,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSomeone who has this amount of anger and motivation probably won\u2019t stop.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know so far:On Monday, a six-inch bomb containing black explosive powder was found in the mailbox of George Soros, a billionaire liberal philanthropist who is known to fund progressive causes. Authorities say a caretaker at the house picked up the manila package, which was not delivered through the U.S. mail but apparently marked to look as though it was, and started to bring it inside. Upon realizing the package contained an explosive device, the caretaker dropped it in a wooded area and notified police, who detonated the bomb somewhere near Soros\u2019 home. Soros was not home at the time. The device is believed to be a pipe bomb, similar to ones also sent to the Clinton residence and the Obama residence.

Authorities say Obama and his family were unharmed and not in danger. The device is believed to be a pipe bomb, similar to ones also sent to the Clinton residence and the Soros residence.

Bill was reportedly in the house but was unharmed, while Hillary was in Florida campaigning for Democrats for the upcoming midterms. \"We are fine thanks to the men and women of the Secret Service,\u201d Clinton said in Florida. \u201cEvery day, we are grateful for their service and commitment. And obviously, never more than today. But it is a troubling time, isn't it?\"The device is believed to be a pipe bomb, similar to ones also sent to the Obama residence and the Soros residence.

CNN reporters continued reporting on the incident from the street outside their headquarters in the Time Warner building. Authorities disposed of the device, which was sent along with an envelope containing an unidentified white powder. The contents of the powder are still under investigation. Notably, there do not appear to be any postal markings on the envelope in which the bomb was contained, and CNN reports that authorities believe the bomb was dropped off by a courier.

The package arrived at Wasserman Schultz\u2019s office because she was listed as the return address on the envelope, NBC reported. The Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office deployed a bomb squad to the scene. Read more:  Office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz evacuated due to suspicious packageYet another bomb may have been mailed to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters. Authorities confirmed they are investigating a package in the Congressional mailroom, and ABC and CNN are both reporting Waters was the target, citing confidential law enforcement sources. Read more:  Another bomb said to target Rep. Maxine Waters discovered in Congressional mail officeA few false reports of bombs targeting politicians began to circulate on Wednesday. Most notably, CNN reported that the White House had been sent a suspicious package. This turned out to be false. San Diego police said they were investigating a suspicious package found outside of an office building that housed a regional office for Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat. Harris\u2019 office released a statement saying that they were not targeted in the attack.Police also performed a sweep of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s home in Delaware, though it\u2019s unclear if this was in response to a threat or just as a precaution. And on Wednesday, after his office and his own brother denied reports that explosive devices were mailed to his offices, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo claimed at an NYPD press conference that a device was, in fact, sent to him. \u201cA device has been sent to my office in Manhattan, which we were just informed about,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat device is also being handled.\u201dCNN then reported that the \u201cdevice\u201d was actually just an information package, and the NYPD confirmed in a statement that Cuomo had not been targeted. According to a Cuomo spokesperson, the \"suspicious package\" actually contained information files on the Proud Boys, a hate group that recently started a violent brawl in upper Manhattan.
