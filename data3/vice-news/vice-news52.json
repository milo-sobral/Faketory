{"id": "Apple Finally Made New Versions of the Good Computers", "paragraph": "Image:\u00a0Apple Apple held a rare New York City event today to unveil the next generation of its glossy devices, and finally did what some of us thought would never happen: it paid attention to what people actually wanted. At a single event, the company overhauled two of its longest ignored and most beloved devices: the MacBook Air and the Mac Mini, as well as giving the iPad Pro its first major redesign since it debuted. All it took for Apple to have a slam-dunk event was updating the best machines in its lineup for the first time in years, surprise! (Here\u2019s where Mac Pro fans should gripe.) Here\u2019s the thing: these devices had been gathering dust for a  long time, making any level of attention well overdue. The MacBook Air first debuted in 2010, but hadn\u2019t seen a meaningful hardware refresh since at least 2015, with even longer elapsing before that. The Mac Mini had reached the point where it was presumed dead, with the last refresh all the way back in 2014, which was only a performance-focused improvement with few meaningful changes. As a result, Apple\u2019s disinterest in the Mac felt like it was beginning to show. It had reached the point where even its most loyal fans were starting to wonder aloud if it was intentionally leaving the products to die while it focused on iOS-based devices. People became frustrated as multiple events a year passed by with no signs of that changing. The MacBook Air is Apple\u2019s most popular computer for a reason: it\u2019s lightweight, but still has the ports people needed to get work done, and didn\u2019t break the bank. If you were planning to buy a computer and didn\u2019t really care what it was, the Air was the perfect computer\u2014until Apple ignored it for years and years and years, instead creating a weird, very expensive MacBook, and then two versions of the MacBook Pro that have been highly controversial. Apple turned that narrative around with today\u2019s event. The new MacBook Air ticks almost all of the boxes I\u2019d expect out of a big update: it finally has a Retina display, there\u2019s a Touch ID sensor, bigger trackpad, higher-powered processors, and it\u2019s even a little bit lighter.  What it\u2019s lost, however, may be a sticking point for some: you\u2019ll have to get used to carrying dongles for all of your old USB devices, because there\u2019s no old-school USB ports on the new model. That\u2019s a sacrifice Apple is willing to make, as a bet that USB-C will be everywhere soon enough, and I believe it\u2019s the right call to make. The Mac Mini\u2019s update is just as big. There\u2019s finally a computer in Apple\u2019s hardware lineup that\u2019s worth buying that doesn\u2019t come with a screen glued to it. The updated Mac Mini can go all the way up to a hex-core Intel processor, 64 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage on the fully-loaded version (which will run you a cool $4,199, by the way.) Good news here: The Mac Mini comes with all the ports you could reasonably want. Beyond just the Mac, the refreshed iPad Pro is such a leap forward from the last generation that it\u2019s good enough to throw in the running to replace the MacBook Air entirely. It\u2019s now sleeker, faster and more able to adapt to all of the use cases you\u2019re throwing at your Mac anyway: the addition of USB-C allows it to work with screens, Face ID makes it frictionless to jump in, and the processors are years ahead of the capabilities of Intel\u2019s own. It\u2019s a tablet, that does a little bit of computing too, and it\u2019s getting better at that story every year. This is why the iPad was unveiled at the same event as a big, splashy MacBook Air refresh: the iPad is still the spiritual successor of the Mac, even if that takes years to actually happen. I left the Mac ecosystem in 2017 and would argue that there are better options out there for your money today like Huawei\u2019s Matebook X Pro, or the Microsoft Surface Book. Rather than fragmenting between both use cases, I can slip between tablet and laptop on the same device, and  that feels like the future.  The Mac refresh feels like it should have arrived in 2016, which is when it probably should have happened, but by arriving today it\u2019s simply a matter of \u2018finally\u2019 for most people. Still, today was the first time since switching away from Apple that I\u2019ve felt like its hardware lineup might be something I was missing out on.  By paying attention to pro users and appeasing their complaints across both Mac and iPad, Apple played a powerful move today: it quelled the loudest complainers and gave people what they wanted across the board. The iPad might be the future, but the Mac is still around for now, and there\u2019s finally a reason for most people to consider buying one again.Sign up for Motherboard Premium."}
