{"id": "An Interview in a Nail Salon with Leikeli47 About Her New Album \u2018Acrylic\u2019", "paragraph": "It\u2019s a brisk and wet Tuesday morning in Bed Stuy, and Leikeli47 is sitting in a nail salon, with a new pink manicure drying under a lamp. Today is election day, so the November chill is compounded by a feeling of tension. Still, the rapper radiates warmth, smiling through her black bandana with ragged cutouts at the eyes and mouth.At points, she apologizes to the nail tech, Luz, for continuously messing up her thumb nail. Her disposition is blunt but laced with traces of Southern hospitality\u2014the seeming biproduct of Brooklyn and Virginia, both places she calls home. When she\u2019s serious, though, she doesn\u2019t mince her words. \u201cMusic is what I do and if I want to be an 80-year-old entertainer, I dare you to say something,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have this thing in the entertainment industry where we\u2019re supposed to stop or retire. What do you mean? I never want Stevie Wonder to stop. I never want D\u2019Angelo to stop. I never want Jay-Z to stop, like ever.\u201dTo the other women in the nail salon, this probably sounds like typical barbershop talk, though it\u2019s anything but a tangent for the rapper, who released her sophomore album,  Acrylic, this November. Leikeli has thought a lot about the legacy she wants to leave and how often artists of color are robbed of one. \u201cAerosmith can do it,\u201d she says, pointing to the 70s rock band\u2019s upcoming 2019 tour. \u201cLed Zeppelin can do it. Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of my favorite bands, and they still do it. N.E.R.D is one of my favorite bands also, and they still deserve to do it.\u201d On stage and off, Leikeli is an advocate for black visibility. It\u2019s an ironic message coming from an artist who still hasn\u2019t disclosed her age, name, or face, but that doesn\u2019t stop its meaning from being urgent.Leikeli weaves motifs of black life throughout her music, imagery so ubiquitous that it could easily take place in Bed-Stuy, Houston, or Oakland. The characters of her stories are hustlers\u2014like the neighborhood \u201ccandy lady,\u201d or the survivors of an unfair world who find solace in the aisles of beauty supply stores. Her debut album  Wash & Set, which came out last year, features the rite-of-passage when black girls graduate from colorful barrettes to billowing curls set under hellishly hot dryers.  Acrylic offers another snapshot of black life, one that comes at a time when black women are quite literally under attack in their own neighborhoods.In August, an Asian-owned Brooklyn salon, Happy Red Apple Nails, shuttered after surveillance footage emerged of staff pummeling a black woman customer with broomsticks after she complained about a $5 eyebrow service. (Following the incident, Teyana Taylor gifted the victim free manicures for life at her nail salon, Junie B. Nails.) Amid protests, Flatbush residents plastered signs on the gates of the closed storefront. One borrowed a quote from Malcolm X: \u201cThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\u201d This is the image Leikeli chose as the album art for the first installment of  Acrylic,  Pick a Color. (The album was released in three parts:  Pick a Color, Design, and the entire project,  Acrylic.)Leikeli asked to meet at She\u2019s Polished, a black-owned salon, which isn\u2019t by coincidence but instead is by design. \u201cYou know exactly where you are when you smell acrylic,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you smell acrylic, you\u2019re in our neighborhood.\u201d As we sit there, Total\u2019s \u201cKissing You\u201d plays softly from a speaker nearby, followed by Maxwell\u2019s \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work\u201d\u2014reminding me of the weekend slow jams black moms play to let the house know it\u2019s time to clean. I\u2019ve frequented nail salons biweekly for a decade, but She\u2019s Polished was the first one that felt like home.Leikeli says she couldn\u2019t watch the video of the brawl in full, but the short clip she saw was enough to want to empower black-owned businesses at large. Now, when she travels, she actively seeks them out. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, because we named it  Pick a Color before that incident, and the title took on a deeper meaning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not to be racist, but as an African-American woman, it\u2019s time for me to make a choice and support my people.\u201d She points to the apron-clad black women circling the floor. \u201cA lot of us don\u2019t know we exist in our own neighborhoods,\u201d she says.The concept behind  Acrylic predates the incident at Apple Nails. The Brooklyn rapper has been leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for a nail-themed album since 2014\u2019s  LK-47 Pt. II. One of the skits on that mixtape,\u201cAcrylic,\u201d features a West Indian patois-wielding character, Nastasha, who reveals her plans to airbrush her boyfriend\u2019s name on a nail\u2014a form of PDA Leikeli admitted she did in high school. Even last year\u2019s \u201cBraids tuh\u2019da (flo)w\u201d sees the rapper commanding women to put their hands up\u2014or \u201cNails, nails to the ceiling,\u201d as Leikeli raps. \u201c Acrylic and  Wash & Set are all premeditated murder,\u201d she says, cocking her head back with a sinister laugh.Her urge to magnify the rituals embedded in black culture, she says, stems partly from a desire to normalize the standards of black beauty. In the weeks leading up to  Acyrlic\u2019s release, Leikeli filled her Instagram with photos of black women with bedazzled nails, including a cameo from the late track and field runner, Flo Jo. For Leikeli, exaggerated nails are more than a fashion statement. \u201cIt was about being fearless with your style,\u201d she says about the images she\u2019s curated on her Instagram. \u201cStepping out of the box and doing things that are not the norm for your respective field. With Flo Jo, you\u2019re not thinking of nails for a runner. The same way with me you\u2019re not thinking a mask for an artist. Those nails spoke to their boldness.\u201dIn the same way hair and nails are important markers of identity, the salons themselves are crucial community spaces. \u201c Wash & Set represented us not looking like the things we\u2019ve been through in our communities,\u201d Leikeli says. When you\u2019re sitting next to TiTi under the dryer, you\u2019re probably buying from the same booster, probably have the same issues, and you don\u2019t even know it. You walk out of there not looking like anything you\u2019ve been through.\u201d Leikeli\u2019s approach isn\u2019t void of pain, but it\u2019s a reminder that there is more to black life than trauma.Acrylic\u2019s 19 songs transport us to her native Brooklyn; one of them is titled \u201cHoyt & Schermerhorn\u201d\u2014a reference New York City subway riders will catch with ease. The album\u2019s title track opens with the words, \u201cThe sound of the world\u201d\u2014an invitation to the world as she knows it. \u201cI ain\u2019t the criminal, you and I know / It\u2019s no coincidence how you come show / Up in my hood, up to no good,\u201d she raps, recalling the racial profiling she\u2019s witnessed over the years. The song, which dons a gloomy piano line similar to The Addams Family theme song, is a laundry list of the constants of her neighborhood: boosters, X and O chains, and single-parent homes. Regardless of public perception, Leikeli couldn\u2019t be happier of her upbringing. \u201cUp in my hood / Proud to say it did me good.\u201dLooking around the salon, I start thinking about how an acrylic set represents a kind of transformation. Acrylic powder hardens in seconds after being mixed with liquid monomer\u2014a process not dissimilar to the one Leikeli is articulating on the album. Day-to-day life may harden some people, but by the end, no two designs are exactly alike.Some of the songs on the album, like \u201cGirl Blunt\u201d and \u201cPost That,\u201d borrow from the dance-centric sound she mined on tracks like \u201cAttitude\u201d and \u201cHeard Em Say.\u201d Elsewhere, though, Leikeli toughens up, offering rugged, bass-heavy tracks like \u201cTic Boom,\u201d \u201cNo Reload,\u201d and \u201cDroppin.\u2019\u201d \u201cTalking to Myself\u201d is the shortest song on  Acrylic, but it packs the hardest punch. The production shuffles like a blaxploitation film and borrows the \u201cWake up!\u201d message from Spike Lee\u2019s  School Daze. \u201cIt\u2019s fire in the water, it\u2019s bugs in the bed / We don\u2019t need to be shot up to be filled up with lead,\u201d she raps, reminding her listeners that the Flint Water Crisis still exists four years later.Leikeli has fixated mainly on granular concepts throughout her career, like getting your hair braided or having an attitude. But \u201cTalking to Myself\u201d sees the artist casting her net wider, exploring the effects that macro issues like environmental racism can have on a community. \u201c\u2018Talking to Myself\u2019 was a moment of me going in the booth and venting,\u201d she says. \u201cWe see what Colin [Kaepernick] does, and he\u2019s paid for it. He still doesn\u2019t have a job today because he believes in something bigger than running that football down the field. I got into this headspace of, How far would you go to get your message across?\u201dAt a glance, the line that follows the Flint reference seems generic: \u201cPour you down the drain / I wish I could just melt you and just pour you down the drain.\u201d But Leikeli isn\u2019t shy about who it was intended for. \u201cWhen I said, \u2018Pour you down the drain,\u2019 I was talking about Trump,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was one of those quick thoughts where I\u2019m fed up, we\u2019re fed up, and this is ridiculous.\u201dLeikeli\u2019s short pink nails are dry, and an hour into our interview, I\u2019m no closer to figuring out her legal name. But I know that the woman sitting in front of me is the same as the acrylic she dedicated an entire album to: hardened by life, but polished under pressure.The bodegas up the block, where she grew up, have been replaced by healthy juice aficionados; the brownstones may look the same, but the people living in them are not.Still, many of the people who grew up here are still here\u2014and one of them is Angie, the owner of She\u2019s Polished, who started doing nails in high school before opening a shop of her own. \u201cPeople will look at a neighborhood you come from like it\u2019s the worst thing ever,\u201d Leikeli says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in it, you see nothing but strength.\u201dKristin Corry is a staff writer at Noisey.
