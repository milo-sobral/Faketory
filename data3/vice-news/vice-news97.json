We imported cattle, we imported 500 horses from the U.S, we bought saddles for every one of them, we imported semen, pharmaceuticals...even the first crails had to be imported and weren't constructed here.\"It started because Putin wants the country to become self-sufficient for food in the next five years, and for food exports to China and the Gulf to help wean Russia\u2019s economy off its increasingly precarious dependence on oil and gas.And Russia\u2019s mass move to agriculture does predate the U.S. and EU sanctions that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but their imposition turbo-charged the growth of a previously dormant industry. Counter-sanctions in 2014 banned the import of food from the West, rendering more than half of the country\u2019s meat, dairy and fish imports illegal overnight.The state then backed domestic producers of cheese, meat, fish, vegetables and wheat to expand rapidly. Many, like Miratorg, hiked production several times over in just a couple of years. Almost $4 billion worth of Russian food has been produced as a result of sanctions, according to the Russian government.But while farms are visibly thriving, the economy at large has contracted and the ruble has collapsed \u2014 leaving millions of Russians worse off and poverty rates surging to a nine-year high. Faced with a near-monopoly on some food products, critics argue that Russian consumers with less money are simply having to spend more on inferior products. And if relations thaw and markets reopen to Western food producers, Russian producers fattened on state support and a captive market might ultimately disappear as quickly as they emerged.\u201cYes, of course, output has increased. But it all comes at a cost to Russian households,\u201d economist Natalia Volchkova told VICE News. \u201cRussia\u2019s counter-sanctions shield these businesses from world competition. They can\u2019t compete with real world prices.\u201dBut even in the unlikely event of a sudden revival in Russo-Western relations, Volchkova says Russia's burgeoning cowboys might not be the first to succumb to market forces.\"Miratorg, now that's a good question,\" she said. \"If they are actually using international practices, they might ultimately manage to be competitive in normal conditions.\"This segment originally aired November 1, 2018 on VICE News Tonight on HBO."}
