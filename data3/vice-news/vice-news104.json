{"id": "Watch the 16 Most Iconic Fast Food Scenes in Film Cuz It's National Fast Food Day", "paragraph": "Screenshot via YouTube Forget the marketplace vendors and street food of Ancient Rome, the meat pies of Paris and London during the Middle Ages, and the fried dough and stuffed buns of 12th-century Asia. Fast food is, and forever will be, the most quintessential American pastime. From the grab-and-eat automats of 1920s New York to the genetically-engineered foodstuffs of 2018 delivered by Uber drivers (and probably soon, by drone), the United States has vaulted fast food into a culinary mainstay, from a $6 billion dollar industry in 1970 to $200 billion strong in 2015. In honor of November 16 being \u201cNational Fast Food Day\u201d (like we need another excuse to eat more cheeseburgers and French fries), here\u2019s a roundup ranking of our favorite fast food moments in movies; scenes starring burgers to breakfast, presented in all their mass-produced, pre-cooked, deep-fried, and assembled-to-order goodness. Plenty of spoilers and greasy food ahead: 16. Double-stacking slices of pizza from   Saturday Night Fever (1977)Legendary Lenny\u2019s Pizza in Brooklyn will forever be known as the pizza joint where Tony Manero (John Travolta) orders two, not three, cheese slices and eats them folded AND stacked, as he struts through Bay Ridge to the rhythm of \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d by The Bee Gees. Is there a greater boss move for your average 19-year-old in the city? 15. Morgan Spurlock vomiting while filming   Super Size Me (2004)Just two days into his month-long experiment to eat nothing but food from McDonald\u2019s three times a day to test if it\u2019s really as bad for you as people say (spoiler alert: it, uh, is), documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock finishes a Super Size double quarter pounder with cheese (that\u2019s a double Royale with cheese, for those of you in Europe), French fries, and a 42-ounce Coke. It takes him 22 minutes to gulp the food down, but only seconds for it all to come back up in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. This awkward scene is the furthest thing from a \u201chappy meal\u201d that we\u2019ve ever seen. 14. Delivering fish and chips (and getting humiliated) in   Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)High school is miserable enough without having to work part-time at \u201cCaptain Hook Fish & Chips,\u201d complete with a white turtleneck and pirate hat uniform. But Brad Hamilton\u2019s (Judge Reinhold) manager makes it infinitely worse by making him wear the outfit (\u201cShow a little pride!\u201d) while on special delivery of \u201ccatch of the day\u201d boxes. On the road, an attractive older woman (played by Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson) spots Brad trying to look suave in his ridiculous getup and laughs at him. Fed up, he dumps his hat and the entire takeout order out his driver\u2019s side window\u2014and we don\u2019t blame him (although we might\u2019ve kept the kinda cool hat). 13. Opening a new Krusty Krab in   The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie (2004)The entire plot of the first Spongebob movie revolves around fast food, from the opening of a new Krusty Krab restaurant (directly adjacent to the first restaurant; when asked why, Mr. Krabs only says, \u201cmoney\u201d) to the evil Plankton\u2019s attempt to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula to bring customers into his rival restaurant, The Chum Bucket, whose menu items include the Chum burger, Chum-on-a-stick, and \u201cChumbalaya,\u201d to SpongeBob\u2019s ultimately heroic rise and earning the title of becoming manager of the new franchise. Never since Bubba Gump Shrimp Company (probably even more so) has the fake food from a fictional restaurant chain seemed so enticing. 12. Junk Food Raining From the Sky in   Kazaam (1996)Is the movie called  Kazaam, starring Shaquille O\u2019Neal as a 5,000-year old genie who grants wishes to an inner-city kid?... Or is the movie called  Shazaam, starring stand-up comedian Sinbad as an awkward genie who grants wishes to two young children? Whatever universe you\u2019re from, there\u2019s no forgetting the scene where, for one wish, the dysfunctional genie makes it rain junk food: burgers and burritos that explode as they hit the ground, loose French fries that fall like rain, and just about the thickest, slimiest-looking stacks of pancakes we\u2019ve see anywhere. I guess having more fast food than you know what to do with was cool when we were a kid, but who wants to scrape together and chow down on a sloppy Whopper picked up off the the ground in a filthy back alley in Brooklyn? 11. Getting In-N-Out Burgers in   The Big Lebowski (1994) It would take too long to describe the meandering, mistaken-identity plot of  The Big Lebowski enough to explain how enjoying \u201csome [In-N-Out] burgers, some beers, and a few laughs\u201d factors into the story if you haven\u2019t seen this Coen Bros. classic (and frankly, if you haven\u2019t, you need to stop reading this article and go and watch the movie immediately). Suffice it to say that it\u2019s the result of a failed interrogation of an unmoved high school student by \u201cThe Dude,\u201d an aging hippie slacker played by Jeff Bridges; his high-strung friend, Vietnam veteran Walter (John Goodman); and chill Donny (Steve Buscemi). They\u2019re on the search for a missing million-dollar kidnapping ransom between drinking beers, discussing the tenets of socialism and nihilism, and participating in competitive bowling sessions.When the high school kid neither talks nor reveals the whereabouts of the money (that The Dude and company later realize was never actually stolen), Walter decides to wreck a nearby sports car, thinking the kid bought it with the missing cash. It was actually a neighbor\u2019s car, who reliates by attacking The Dude\u2019s car next. At the end of the night, all the trio walk away with are a couple of burgers, no beers, and definitely no laughs. 10. Inventing the \u201cspeedee service system\u201d in   The Founder (2016) Every second of this biographical drama may be all about McDonald\u2019s and how businessman Ray Kroc took over the burger operation that brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald originally pioneered and built, but the scene that steals the show is this montage where the brothers (played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch) explain to Ray (Michael Keaton) how they developed their innovative \u201cspeedee\u201d assembly-line service system that ensures burger-making continuity and smooth operations, from buns to pickles to the perfect squirt of ketchup and mustard. Moving over a chalk-outlined tennis court in a pseudo-serving ballet, the brothers coordinate with their new hires for hours about the right kitchen layout and process to ensure their restaurant is \u201ca symphony of efficiency, not a wasted motion.\u201d It\u2019s a heartbreaking level of care and love that the McDonald\u2019s brothers brought to their original restaurant\u2014a far cry from the weird antics and general grossness too often seen from the fast food conglomerate in 2018. 9. The entirety of   Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) Flynn Lockwood\u2019s inventions are all terrible (monkey thought translators, spray-on shoes, \u201crat birds\u201d), save for one: a machine that looks like a microwave combined with a colander that can convert water to food. Mostly fast food, like cheeseburgers, hotdogs, pizza, donuts, and anything else that the residents of Swallow Falls, a dumpy island in the Atlantic that formerly specialized in sardine fishing and canning, can imagine and ask for. But as tourism increases, so does the size of the falling food, which causes climate change in the form of spaghetti tornados and food storms that threaten cities around the world.Under all the impressive visual CGI imagery of giant food falling on the city (and on people) is a story built around the idea of being one\u2019s self, no matter how bizarre or seemingly unpopular. This plus countless sight gags and the best food-raining montage in recent memory makes  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs one of the best 3D, computer-animated, sci-fi/disaster/satire/family comedies out there. And it\u2019s definitely out there. 8. A \u201csuperb\u201d review for   Mystic Pizza (1988)Everyone\u2019s on red alert when snobby food critic \u201cThe Fireside Gourmet\u201d (Louis Turenne) visits Mystic Pizza in small-town Connecticut, takes a few tentative bites of pizza, and dickishly abandons the entire rest of the pie after only eating half a slice. But a few days later, when the critic calls Mystic Pizza \u201csuperb\u201d on his famous TV show and awards it his highest \u201cfour-star\u201d rating, the women of the pizza shop (played by Julia Roberts, Annabeth Gish, Lili Taylor, and Conchata Ferrell) are ecstatic. On a larger scale, it\u2019s meant a symbol; an affirmation that, despite everything, whatever they\u2019re doing over there at Mystic Pizza, from figuring out college, to dating, and marriage, is OK. They\u2019re going to be alright. 7. Going through the drive-thru in   Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) While protecting annoying federal witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), LAPD sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) hit a Subway drive-through for dinner and the sandwich shop gets their order wrong. Leo demands the group goes back (\u201cI hate tuna, okay? I refuse to get stuck with tuna!\u201d) but they\u2019re already several blocks away and not turning around. So Leo lays some truth on them on one of the realest monologues in all of movie history: \u201cCan I give you two guys a friendly piece of advice, okay? Don\u2019t ever go up to the drive-thru! OK? Always walk up to the counter. You know why?\u201d Leo asks. \u201cThey fuck you at the drive-thru! They know you\u2019re gonna be miles away before you find out you got fucked! OK? They know you\u2019re not gonna turn around and go back. So they don\u2019t care. \u2026 I\u2019m not eating this tuna!\u201d 6. The American cheeseburger from   Iron Man (2008) Three months after escaping captivity in Afghanistan, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) asks for two things when he steps off the plane: a press conference (to publicly announce that his weapons company will no longer produce weapons) and an American cheeseburger. Stark\u2019s already finished one burger when he later rolls up at Stark Industries, consumes a second one walking in, and pulls a third (?!) from his jacket pocket as he addresses reporters.It\u2019s a cute scene that feels like product placement for Burger King. But in real life, Robert Downey Jr. had previously stopped for Burger King back in 2003 while driving a car filled with drugs. He ordered \u201ca disgusting burger \u2026 and this big soda, and I thought something really bad was going to happen.\u201d Realizing his visit to Burger King was virtually the same thing as hitting rock bottom, Downey Jr. threw all his drugs into the ocean that night and vowed to get cleaned up. The cheeseburger scene in  Iron Man is a nod to Downey Jr.\u2019s own life-changing cheeseburger moment.  5. Ordering pizza in   Home Alone (1990) After older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray), younger cousin Fuller (Kieran Culkin), and the rest of his gigantic extended family eats all the cheese pizza that he specifically asked for, Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) decides to order his own pizza once he gets full run of the house in  Home Alone. But how to do that without alerting the pizza delivery guy (love the name of the pizza joint, \u201cLittle Nero\u2019s,\u201d which promises \u201cno fiddlin\u2019 around!\u201d) that Kevin\u2019s just an eight-year-old kid left at home by accident during the holidays?A VHS copy of the fictional gangster flick  Angels with Filthy Souls might help. Using the film\u2019s dialogue as instructions for where the delivery guy can leave the pizza and how much change he can keep (\u201cYa filthy animal!\u201d), Kevin\u2019s able to test out his movie pause-and-play technique in advance of his later encounter with \u201cWet Bandits\u201d Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern). Although why Kevin thought he\u2019d be able to keep a lower profile by pretending to \u201copen fire\u201d with sounds of a machine gun firing at the pizza delivery guy is anyone\u2019s guess. 4. The chicken dinner from   Little Miss Sunshine (2006) Dad (Greg Kinnear) is sweating over a possible publishing deal for his motivational self-help seminar, academic scholar Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has temporarily moved in after a failed suicide attempt, Nietzsche-reading teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence until he can become a test pilot, and Cheryl (Toni Collette), the mother, is just trying to keep it together and put food on the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, chicken? Every night, it\u2019s the fucking chicken! Holy God almighty,\u201d yells the family\u2019s heroin-snorting grandpa, who spots the big bucket of fried chicken going around the table. \u201cIs it possible, just once, to get something to eat around here that\u2019s not the goddamn, fucking chicken?\u201dIn this film about \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d  Little Miss Sunshine is a reminder that just being ourselves (and accepting who we are) is infinitely more important to one\u2019s happiness than the beauty pageants and dumb competitions of life. If we can\u2019t make room for a little ice cream, what\u2019s the point of living? 3. Trying to order breakfast in   Falling Down (1993) \u201cI want breakfast,\u201d recently laid-off defense contractor William Foster says to the cheery front counter person at Whammyburger. So begins the tense-as-hell ordering scene from  Falling Down, where Michael Douglas\u2019 character first attempts to order breakfast (after breakfast serving hours have ended, a lesson that McDonald\u2019s learned to change in recent years) then becomes upset that the savory-looking \u201cWhammy\u201d burger in the picture doesn\u2019t match the flaccid, pancake-like \u201cmiserable squashed thing\u201d he\u2019s been given. Falling Down perfectly captured the tension of a sweltering early 90s Los Angeles on the brink of being ready to burst; shot in Lynwood, the film\u2019s production in 1992 actually had to be paused due to the LA riots. Douglas plays the ultimate angry white male (his father, Golden Age veteran actor Kirk Douglas, thought it was his son\u2019s best work to date) whose long-simmering rage finally culminates into explosive violence. 2. The Big Kahuna Burger from   Pulp Fiction (1994) All of  Pulp Fiction is essentially an homage to fast food: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up a Denny\u2019s-type diner at the beginning and end of the film, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) considers the merits of a $5 milkshake for Miss Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) at the 50s-themed Jack Rabbit Slim\u2019s restaurant (don\u2019t miss Steve Buscemi moonlighting as their waiter, Buddy Holly), and Vincent and Jules Winnfield\u2019s (Samuel L. Jackson)\u2019s discussion about what McDonald\u2019s Quarter Pounders are called in Paris. (\u201cThey got the metric system, they wouldn\u2019t know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.\u201d)But  Pulp Fiction\u2019s ultimate fast food moment arrives early in the film when Vince and Jules go to retrieve a briefcase for their mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) from a few associates that have double-crossed the boss. This tense sequence is punctuated by Jules\u2019 sudden interest in the \u201cBig Kahuna\u201d burger that one of the guys is eating. (\u201cThis IS a tasty burger! \u2026 I can\u2019t usually get [burgers] because my girlfriend\u2019s a vegetarian, which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.\u201d) Jules tries a bite of the burger, slurps all of the guy\u2019s Sprite\u2014then proceeds to shoot nearly everyone in the room. Say what? 1. Harold and Kumar finally go to White Castle in   Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) What should only be a 90-minute drive from Jersey\u2019s New Brunswick to Cherry Hill takes Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) all night in this 2004 stoner comedy that\u2019s basically one giant commercial for White Castle. But what a commercial it is; by the time Harold and Kumar reach the blue-and-white cheeseburger haven, we\u2019re almost as hungry for those delicious little sliders as they are. Krispy Kreme missed out on the opportunity of a lifetime by saying no to appearing in  Harold and Kumar, a decision they\u2019re still probably kicking themselves over.In his positive review of the film, Roger Ebert wrote that \u201cone secret of fiction is the creation of unique characters who are precisely defined. The secret of comedy is the same, with the difference being that the characters must be obsessed with unwholesome but understandable human desires.\u201d Nothing\u2019s more understandable than a sudden and pervasive craving for fast food, unwholesome as it may be.  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle captures this deep emotional struggle, while also casting an Asian-American actor and Indian actor in lead roles, and doubles as a decent stoner buddy flick and a road trip movie. What more is there to ask for?Maybe some fries with that. Subscribe to Munchies."}
