The water bottle activist and noted high-fashion skirt wearer was performing at Tyler\u2019s Camp Flog Gnaw event this weekend, when he announced \u201c\u201cI just want to say, Tyler, the Creator is the best friend in the world and I love him so fucking much.\u201d This is something we too would say if enlisted to perform at our friend\u2019s festival. What came next, not so much. The oldest Smith scion continued, \u201cTyler doesn\u2019t want to say, but Tyler\u2019s my motherfucking boyfriend and he\u2019s been my motherfucking boyfriend my whole fucking life! Tyler, the Creator is my motherfucking boyfriend! It\u2019s true!\u201d If we could add more exclamation marks to all those \u201cfucks,\u201d without offending the Gods of grammar to whom we have pledged our lives, we would. \u201cTyler, the Creator is my fucking boyfriend, if you take anything away from this fucking show, that\u2019s what you take away!\u201d Well, fear not Jaden, for the fact that Tyler is your boyfriend is the one thing we have taken awayOf course, it has since come into question whether Jaden was just making a \u201cjoke,\u201d which if he was, would be very cruel to all of us. Tyler looks slightly horrified, in the video above, to be called out on stage, as we would too. But is it because a) Jaden isn\u2019t his boyfriend, or b), 20-year-old boyfriends are really embarrassing? Only time will tell. Jaden has since muddied the water further by tweeting the below: If this turns up to be a joke, consider us pissed. If not, congratulations to the happy couple. suscribe to i-D's positive vibes."}
