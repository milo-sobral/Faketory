Now, some of the planet\u2019s biggest fashion brands are committing to addressing that crisis, specifically by taking on the issue of plastic pollution and waste. Yesterday, Burberry, H&M, L'Or\u00e9al, Stella McCartney, Unilever, the British and Chilean governments, and more signed a pledge -- the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment -- and announced their pact to \u201ceradicate plastic waste and pollution at the source\u201d. Created by UN Environment and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the commitment outlines three targets for brands, governments and nonprofits to hit in order to reduce plastic waste. Firstly, by eliminating single use and unnecessary plastic packaging, secondly by encouraging innovation in recycle, reusable, or compostable plastics and thirdly by reusing or recycling existing plastic in circulation without throwing it away. The commitment also introduces a new level of accountability, as the brands and organizations who signed yesterday\u2019s pledge are required to publish their progress annually, with targets reviewed every 18 months. \u201cPlastic waste and pollution is a big global environmental challenge,\u201d said H&M\u2019s environmental and sustainability manager, Cecilia Br\u00e4nnsten, in a statement. \"There is no single brand that can tackle this industry-wide challenge on its own. We must act as one voice and the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment is a big step in the right direction, as it will align business and governments on a common agenda and timeframe.\"This article originally appeared on i-D UK.suscribe to i-D's positive vibes."}
