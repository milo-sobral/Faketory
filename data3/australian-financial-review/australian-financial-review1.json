She observed\u00a0it was often impossible to get hold of anyone from global non-profit body ICANN, which co-ordinates the maintenance of web domains,\u00a0until an incident was already over.\"Things like being able to easily access ICANN and look up IP addresses is a lot more important than accessing the minutiae of encrypted data communications,\" she said.\"In terms of law enforcement, looking at the collaborative frameworks betweens our governments globally and moving towards a more globally centric model for regulation is really important.\"Sure the Australian government may be able to determine attribution as\u00a0a result of getting into those encrypted communications, but who are they going to call? What will Vlad say?\" Asked about how Telstra ensures its own security\u00a0as the owner of crucial national infrastructure, Ms McNamara conceded that even its own relatively tech-savvy staff could fall victim to a social engineering phishing attack.She said her team had tested staff two weeks ago with an email that purported to contain an incorrectly directed payslip, and asked them to open it\"Clearly you shouldn't click on the attachment, but 60 per cent of people did,\" she said.\"With phishing attacks you know not to click on links\u00a0but it seems nobody can resist looking at somebody's payslip, and in social engineering there is always a way around security.\"\u00a0After publication The Australian Financial Review was contacted by Telstra to clarify Ms McNamara's role at the company, which was described\u00a0in the article as presented at Sibos.Telstra statement: \"Ms McNamara is no longer employed by Telstra and was not speaking on Telstra's behalf. Her last role for Telstra was with Cyber Security Enterprise Solutions. She was not Head of Cyber Security for Telstra as reported.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
