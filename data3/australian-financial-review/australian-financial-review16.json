Mr Pence will deliver his speech just minutes after Chinese President Xi Jinping\u00a0speaks at the forum, which Mr Morrison will also address.US officials said the speech would \"connect\"\u00a0to one Mr Pence delivered in early October accusing China of stealing US\u00a0intellectual property, suppressing human rights and meddling in US elections \u2013 an address analysts said marked the start of a cold war\u00a0between Washington DC and Beijing.With tensions already high between the US and China over trade, the two countries are locked in a race for regional influence in Asia and the Pacific. Mr Pence will seek to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative with the promise of US assistance for infrastructure development.It is expected Mr Pence will\u00a0flesh out details of a\u00a0new trilateral partnership with Australia and Japan, to support infrastructure\u00a0development, with several projects identified.Amid concerns over Mr Trump's isolationist \"America\u00a0first\" rhetoric, Mr Pence\u00a0will stress how a\u00a0private-sector driven approach can bring prosperity to both the Indo-Pacific as well as the US.\u00a0He will also emphasise the importance of sovereignty for the countries in the region, including a transparent and corruption-free civil society, free and open internet and freedom of navigation rights for shipping and aircraft \u2013 a direct shot at China for trying to coerce less powerful nations.In his speech and throughout their visit, Mr Pence and Mr Bolton will also hammer China over its militarisation of the South China Sea, the importance of keeping up economic and diplomatic pressure on\u00a0North Korea to denuclearise and the ongoing fight to counter terrorism.Mr Pence will \"deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations' sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States\", his spokeswoman said.In an opinion piece for The Washington Post published on the weekend, Mr Pence wrote that \"Businesses, not bureaucrats, will drive our efforts, because governments and state-owned enterprises are incapable of building lasting prosperity\"The United States will work with like-minded nations \u2013 from India to the Pacific islands \u2013 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values.\u00a0The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\"\u00a0Mr Pence's trip to the region will be a prelude to a crucial meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina later this month, talks that could pave the way for peace or an escalation\u00a0in the trade war between the US and China.The Vice-President will base himself in Cairns during APEC, flying to Port Moresby each day for events. He will arrive on Friday and meet Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormackPrime Minister Scott Morrison will use APEC as a chance to meet many Pacific Island nation leaders, hard on the heels of announcing a pivot in foreign policy last week to put greater emphasis on the region, including making $3 billion available in loans and export grants.He will host them for a barbecue at the Australian High Commissioner's house on Sunday evening, although Mr Xi is also planning his own reception for them.Australia's aims at APEC will be to emphasise the virtues of open trade and investment. Key policy themes will include digital trade and economic integration. However climate change \u2013 an\u00a0issue of existential importance to Pacific islands \u2013 risks being marginalised in light of the US's well-documented opposition to the Paris emissions reduction pact.\u00a0With both Mr Trump and Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin skipping APEC, Mr Xi will be the most notable world leader at the summit.\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
