The company has not and will not respond to the extortion attempts.\"In September, Austal secured a new deal with the US Navy to build two more combat ships at its shipyards in Mobile, Alabama.The deal brought to 17 the number of Independence class littoral combat ships ordered from the shipyards.The federal government has engaged \u00a0Austal to building 21 patrol boats for Pacific nations at its shipyards south of Perth in Western Australia.The government also pushed for Austal to be part of the consortium building 12 offshore patrol boats for the Australian Navy, but the company was unable to reach an agreement with lead contractor Luerssen.\u00a0In a joint statement the Department of Defence, Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, said no compromise of classified or sensitive information or technology had\u00a0been identified so far with investigations continuing.\"This incident reinforces the serious nature of the cyber security threat faced by defence industry, and the need for industry partners to put in place, and maintain, strong cyber defences,\" the statement said.\"Defence and the ACSC have provided cyber security assistance to Austal and are working with Austal to assess and mitigate harm.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
