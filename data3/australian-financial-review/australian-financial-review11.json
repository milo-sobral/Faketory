Kidman & Co cattle empire purchased for $387 million in late 2016, increased its revenue to $51.1 million with underlying next profit after tax of $10.1 million.The company described itself as the most successful private mining and agriculture company in Australia's history and said it would continue to look at more acquisitions in those sectors.It recently acquired junior miner Atlas Iron\u00a0after staring down Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group, advanced the first $US250 million tranche of its investment in UK-based potash mine developer Sirius Minerals and paid about $69 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in Riversdale Resources, the owner of the Grassy Mountain hard coking coal project in Canada.Hancock Prospecting said it was investing in exploration and evaluation of wholly owned iron ore projects and on future Hope Downs mines with joint venture partner Rio Tinto.\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
