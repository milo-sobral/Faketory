He has repeatedly declared that he doesn't believe China is \"ready\" to do a trade deal that would end the dispute.Trade minister Simon Birmingham flew  to Canada late on Monday for talks with a group of \"like-minded\" counterparts  working on a series of WTO proposals they hope to present to Mr Trump, who has threatened to withdraw the US from the organisation unless changes are made.The group includes ministers from Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Brazil, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand.Mr Birmingham said he would push the importance of \"global trade rules\" and the need to find changes that \"improve confidence in the WTO\".\"Continued progress on WTO reform will be vital in helping to safeguard the multilateral trading system and also the ability of the WTO to deliver real outcomes for its members,\" he said.A key source of tension among the group - which has been working together all year - has been a perceived lack of input from the US on what changes it would like to see.After his visit to Canada, the first by an Australian trade minister in almost four years, Mr Birmingham will fly to Washington where he is expected to brief US trade representative Robert Lighthizer on details of the Ottawa talks.\"This will provide an opportunity to continue to promote the interests of Australian businesses and to advocate for a WTO-consistent resolution between the US and China,\" Mr Birmingham said.Mr Birmingham's predecessor Steven Ciobo told The Australian Financial Review in July that Australia wouldn't back changes to the global rules-based system that resulted in a \"might is right\" outcome.There is also concern the Trump administration is effectively shutting down the ability of nations to resolve trade disputes by refusing to approve appointments of the WTO's seven-member appeals body, which is now down to just three judges. Once one of those leaves or retires or recuses, the whole system will grind to a halt as there must be a minimum of three to hear casesThe struggles confronting Australia's top officials in determining what the US's strategic objectives are under Mr Trump mirrors the experience of other nations.China's ambassador to Washington Cui Tiankai took the highly unusual step last week of appearing on Fox TV - one of Mr Trump's favourite cable networks - to express bewilderment over who actually calls the shots on trade policy in the White House.Even some in Mr Trump's Republican Party are becoming restive, with Senate leader Mitch McConnell last week prodding the president for a swift resolution saying retaliatory tariffs are starting to hurt the \"red hot\" US economy.While there had been tentative hopes of a breakthrough when Mr Trump joints President Xi Jinping in Argentina for the Group of 20 leaders summit late next month, there is renewed speculation their meeting won't resolve the trade row.With the US demanding a narrowing of America's trade deficit with China, as well as an end to what Washington says is intellectual property theft, few believe those barriers can be surmounted in Argentina.Signs of ongoing discord include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's threat over the weekend to revise the criteria the US government uses to determine currency manipulation by other nations, after his department last week found China fell short of the existing definitions.There is \"no way of gauging whether either of the presidents is prepared to make the necessary concessions to return their respective governments to the negotiating table,\" said Carl Weinberg, analyst at High Frequency Economics.\"No talks of any substance on trade are going on right now...we suspect the meeting will be cancelled if no deal is in the offing by the time the date draws near.\"With the US president currently focussed on campaigning for the November midterms, administration watchers say Mr Trump has no intention of backing off the pressure on China because he wants their leaders to feel more pain from the tariffs, which he believes will take more time.Axios reported on Sunday that the trade war was at \"the beginning of the beginning\", quoting a White House source.\"The Trump economic team has done no substantive planning so far for the bilateral meeting's agenda, largely because the purpose of the meeting is for Trump and Xi to reconnect, eyeball each other\u2026 It's a heads of state meeting, not a trade meeting,\" the news website said.Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, questioned China's ability to wait out the trade dispute, warning it could derail the country's development and increase the risk of falling into a \"middle-income development trap\".\"Rather than wait it out, China would be better advised to follow the approach of South Korea, Mexico and Canada by making concessions to reach an accommodation with the US,\" he wrote for Bloomberg News.While in Canada, Mr Birmingham will also press Canadian trade minister Jim Carr on the the need for Ottawa to ratify the TPP-11, which passed through Australia's parliament last week.Four countries have already completed their formalities and another two are needed for the Trans-Pacific trade pact to come into force.\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
