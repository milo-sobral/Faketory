This is exactly the purpose of the PJCIS inquiry process, which has consistently resulted in bipartisan recommendations that have strengthened and improved proposed national security legislation, and which the government has consistently endorsed.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Reviewwww.afr.comSorry, you have entered an incorrect email address or password.Please enter your email addressPlease enter your passwordNew to The Australian Financial Review ?Get unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights, including our award-winning app.Already a subscriber?
