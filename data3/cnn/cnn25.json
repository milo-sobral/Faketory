Scroll through the posts below to see how it unfolded or visit CNN Politics.From CNN's Liz StarkPresident Donald Trump claimed tonight Democrats were encouraging caravans of migrants to \"violate our laws and to break into our country.\"\u201cAs we speak, the Democrat Party is openly encouraging caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to break into our country,\u201d Trump told the Wisconsin crowd.He emphasized that this is a \u201ccrisis on the border\u201d and continued to blame Democrats for immigration policies in the US. \u201cRight now is the sole result of Democrat laws and activist Democrat judges that do whatever they want and that prevent us from returning illegal aliens back home to Central America and other parts of the world.\u201dSome background: US officials have been keeping their eyes on a caravan that's forming in El Salvador, a Department of Homeland Security official told CNN on Tuesday. And another migrant caravan of around 2,000 people entered Guatemala from Honduras and is expected to reach Guatemala City on Wednesday.US-bound migrant caravans are not uncommon, as Central Americans desperate to escape violence and poverty band together for safety on the road. Some advocates also use the mass movements to help draw attention to political causes.But the formation of new caravans in Central America comes as political pressure mounts over a convoy of thousands of people\u00a0now transiting Mexico, en route from Honduras to the United States.\u00a0That caravan has drawn the ire of the President, who in an apparent fear campaign aimed at boosting turnout in the November 6 midterm elections. Trump has blamed Democrats, without evidence, for pushing for overrun borders.From CNNs Betsy KleinPresident Trump vowed tonight to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, even though his administration\u2019s actions say otherwise.\u201cThe Democratic healthcare plan would obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage for nearly half a million seniors here in Wisconsin,\u201d he said, vowing that \u201cRepublicans want to protect Medicare.\u201dTrump also railed against Obamacare, and said \u201cessentially, we\u2019ve dismantled it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been brought down to size \u2014 if you\u2019ve noticed your premiums are going up. They\u2019re going up very little by comparison\u201d to how much they would have gone up if Obamacare provisions had stayed in\u00a0place, he said.Why this matters: A Democratic measure aimed at eliminating short-term health care plans that don't have to cover pre-existing conditions\u00a0failed in the Senate earlier this month. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to vote for the measure. The resolution was aimed at rebuffing a Trump executive order unveiled in August that made it easier to buy these plans.The White House supported several Obamacare repeal bills, including one in the House of Representatives that advocates argued weakened coverage of pre-existing conditions. Several moderate Republicans in the House of Representatives even cited a lack of protections for people with pre-existing conditions as a reason they voted \"no.\"From CNN's Betsy KleinPresident Donald Trump heaped praise on another onetime 2016 rival \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whom he brought to the stage during his rally.\u201cScott Walker is a tireless warrior,\u201d Trump said, prompting a \u201cfour more years\u201d chant from the crowd.\u201cWe are so happy to have you back here in the state of Wisconsin,\u201d Walker told Trump after taking the stage.Walker said the President called him recently while he was campaigning alongside Vice President Mike Pence and asked him where to go. \u201cI said Wausau,\u201d Walker said. \u201cPretty good crowd here tonight.\u201dThe governor touted record unemployment rates, taxes, and the Foxconn investment. (The company is\u00a0expected to spend at least $9 billion\u00a0building a plant in Wisconsin that will employ thousands of workers making screens for devices.)Walker also made sure to use the opportunity to talk about healthcare and pre-existing conditions.\u201cThe President mentioned my wife, Tonette, who does a super job. She\u2019s got Type 1 diabetes. I want to reinforce it: we will always cover people like my wife with pre-existing medical conditions, don\u2019t believe the lies, don\u2019t believe the lies,\u201d he said.From CNN's Betsy KleinFormer Trump administration chief of staff Reince Priebus is at the rally tonight in his native Wisconsin, receiving a shoutout from President Trump.\u201cIt took us about five years to figure out how the hell to pronounce his name,\u201d Trump joked in Mosinee.\u00a0Trump said Priebus is \u201cdoing fantastically well\u201d and remarked that he is loved in both   Washington and Wisconsin.\u201cReally talented guy,\u201d he said of the former GOP chairman.He added: \u201cGreat guy, we had a lot of fun. That was a lot of fun. And he loves this place.\u201dFrom CNN's Liz StarkAfter criticizing Democrats on taxes, President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0reflected on how \u201cnice\u201d he was being at his\u00a0rally in Wisconsin.\u201cAnd hopefully we can keep it that way, right? We\u2019re going to keep it that way,\u201d he added.From CNN's Eric BradnerPresident Donald Trump pointed the finger Wednesday night at Democrats and the news media for the turbulent national political environment, on the same day explosive devices were mailed to the Obamas, the Clintons, CNN and other public officials.Trump took no responsibility for the tone of the political discourse.During a rally in Wisconsin, the President promised to bring those responsible for mailing the explosive devices to justice.\"Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself. No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, corrosion or control, we all know that. Such conduct much be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted,\" he said.\"We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. It'll happen.\"Then he pivoted, saying those in the political arena \"must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective.\"\"The language of moral condemnation and destructive, routine -- these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop,\" he said.He complained of \"mobs\" -- a reference to protesters, who opposed Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination and confronted Republican senators on Capitol Hill, and who have challenged GOP lawmakers and Trump Cabinet officials at restaurants and in public.\"No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often and all the time. It's got to stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property. There is one way to settle our disagreements -- it's called peacefully, at the ballot box. That's what we want,\" Trump said.He then said it's the news media's responsibility to set the national political tone.\"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it,\" he said.Trump took no responsibility for his own rhetoric -- which has included attacks on news outlets and Democratic opponents, as well as moments like a recent rally in Montana where he praised a Republican congressman who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his body-slamming a reporter.From CNN's Betsy KleinPresident Donald Trump vowed an \u201caggressive investigation\" into the attempted attacks on former Presidents Clinton and Obama, as well as other former government officials and CNN.\u201cAny acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself. No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation or coercion or control, we all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted,\u201d he said.But he then pivoted to calling for people on \u201call sides\u201d to come together.\u201cFor example, those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. Have to do that,\" he said. Trump continued: \"The language of moral\u00a0condemnation and destructive\u00a0routine, these are arguments and\u00a0disagreements that have to stop. No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often, it\u2019s done all the time. Gotta stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property. There is one way to settle our disagreements, it\u2019s called peacefully at the ballot box.\"\u00a0And then he had a message for the media.President Trump opened tonight's rally by addressing the bombs and suspicious package that were intercepted.\"My highest duty, as you know, as\u00a0President, is to keep America\u00a0safe.\u00a0That's what we talk about.\u00a0That's what we do,\" he said.\u00a0\"The federal government is\u00a0conducting an aggressive\u00a0investigation and we will find\u00a0those responsible and we will\u00a0bring them to justice.\u00a0Hopefully very quickly.\u00a0Any acts or threats of political\u00a0violence are an attack on our\u00a0democracy, itself.\"Trump continued: \"No nation can succeed that\u00a0tolerates violence or the threat\u00a0of violence as a method of political intimidation,\u00a0coercion, or control.\u00a0We all know that.\u00a0Such conduct must be fiercely\u00a0opposed and firmly prosecuted.\u00a0We want all sides to come\u00a0together in peace and harmony.\u00a0We can do it.\u00a0We can do it.\u00a0We can do it.\u00a0It will happen.\"Follow CNN politicsPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience."}
