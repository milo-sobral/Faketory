{"id": "\n\n\n\nWill the US ban Central American migrants?", "paragraph": "The Stream is a social media community with its own daily TV show.A caravan of thousands of Central American men, women and children\u00a0is slowly making its way north through Mexico. Trekking hundreds of miles on foot, many of the asylum seekers say their eventual goal is to cross the southern border of the United States. But what type of welcome will they receive once they get there?\nUS President Donald\u00a0Trump is considering plans to deny asylum and ban the entry of Central American migrants. Additionally, 5,200\u00a0US troops\u00a0will be deployed to provide support to US Border Patrol - a decision that has prompted outrage from rights groups.\nWith the US midterm elections one week away, Trump and other Republicans are portraying the migrant caravan as\u00a0\"an invasion\"\u00a0and using the issue to criticise US Democrats' position on immigration.\nThe president's opponents, though, accuse him of whipping up fear to win support for an anti-immigration agenda, pointing out that the caravan is still more than 1,000 kilometres away and that such caravans are not unusual.\nThis latest caravan \u2013 which has inspired the formation of new caravans \u2013 started in\u00a0mid-October in Honduras. As word of the Honduran migration spread, people from Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador also joined. Many say they are fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries.\nHow should the US respond to Central American caravans, is the issue being exploited for political ends, and what can\u00a0the people making their way to the US expect from the asylum seeking process? We will ask a panel of experts.\u00a0On this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\nJohn Holman, @johnholman100\nAl Jazeera Correspondent\nHugo Castro\nHuman Rights Activistborderangels.org\nRaquel Godos, @RaquelGodos\nJouranlist, EFE NewsRead more:\u00a0\nTrump considering plan to ban entry of migrants at southern border, deny asylum - Washington Post\nHow Republicans are using immigration to scare voters to the polls - Reuters\nLatin American asylum seekers hit US policy \u201cwall\u201d \u2013 IRIN News\u200bWhat do you think?
