{"id": "How can Gaza's contaminated water catastrophe be solved?", "paragraph": "Barely three percent of Gaza's drinking water wells is fit for human consumption, and the crisis is claiming lives.This article is the second of a two-part series on Gaza's water crisis. The first, which\u00a0examines Gaza's water and health catastrophe, was published on Monday, October 29.Gaza - When it comes to survival in Gaza, safe, clean drinking water\u00a0is not at the top of Mousa Hillah's list of priorities.\u00a0Since the\u00a02014 war,\u00a0Hillah,\u00a0known to neighbours and family as Abu Ali,\u00a0has had far bigger worries,\u00a0which are\u00a0etched deeply into the exhausted face of the 48-year-old grandfather.Dodging shell fire from Israeli tanks, he\u00a0fled with his family\u00a0from the destruction of his Shuja'iyya neighbourhood, flattened by Israel in\u00a0an\u00a0attack so devastating - 7,000 shells in barely an hour - that it astonished even US military officials. (\"Holy bejeezus!\" one retired general exclaimed.)The family\u00a0took refuge for months in an\u00a0in-law's\u00a0house near the sea, along with 50\u00a0other people. When\u00a0they returned,\u00a0Abu Ali\u00a0found his home - the one he had built after 30 years of working construction in Israel - utterly destroyed. Brick by board, he rebuilt it, adorning his front entrance, in a dose of\u00a0biting\u00a0irony,\u00a0with repurposed tank shells.And now, as he sits in the filtered morning light beneath a lattice of grape leaves,\u00a0he\u00a0worries less about potable water than the Israeli drone buzzing overhead - often the harbinger of another attack.Gidon Bromberg, director of Ecopeace Middle East, based in Tel Aviv\"I want to sleep well,\" Abu Ali says, as his family\u00a0takes refuge inside the rebuilt house.\u00a0\"I don't feel safe\u00a0in my home.\"So the\u00a0brackish, undrinkable\u00a0water\u00a0that sputters\u00a0from his tap, or the\u00a0sweet\u00a0water with possible faecal contamination in his rooftop tank: these are issues Abu Ali files under the category of extreme nuisance.\u00a0This very morning, for example,\u00a0the\u00a0electricity came\u00a0on\u00a0only from 6:30 to 8:30. It shut off\u00a0before\u00a0the water delivery truck arrived - \"too late to pump the water to the roof,\" Abu Ali complains. A shortage of drinking water is a\u00a0major\u00a0concern, but clearly, worrying about the buzzing drone takes priority.\u00a0Yet if the Gaza Strip truly becomes \"uninhabitable\" by 2020, as the UN and humanitarian groups warn, it will be largely because of the utter collapse of the system for delivering safe drinking water and properly disposing of disease-causing sewage.Because of Gaza's water and sewage catastrophe, medical experts are now seeing sharp increases in waterborne and foodborne diseases, including gastroenteritis, severe diarrhoea, salmonella, typhoid fever,\u00a0an \"alarming magnitude\" of\u00a0stunting in young children, and even something called \"blue baby syndrome.\"Independent, peer-reviewed medical studies also document an alarming\u00a0rise\u00a0in\u00a0anaemia\u00a0and\u00a0infant mortality.\u00a0And doctors in Gaza's hospitals now report increased cases of paediatric cancer.For years these torments\u00a0seemed\u00a0sealed off from the outside world by layers of fences, locked gates, patrolling Israeli drones and warplanes, and\u00a0international disdain\u00a0and indifference. Now, finally,\u00a0from Washington to European capitals, and even\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0security\u00a0infrastructure in Tel Aviv,\u00a0alarm bells are going off,\u00a0warning that something must be done to prevent the water catastrophe in Gaza from spinning out of control.\u00a0\"If you really want to change the lives of people, you have to solve the water issue first,\" says Adnan Abu Hasna, Gaza spokesperson for the UN Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA.The crisis essentially began with the creation of Israel in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven from their towns and villages and the population of Gaza quadrupled in a matter of weeks. Now,\u00a0three-quarters of\u00a0Gaza's two million people are\u00a0refugees. Their descendants put immense pressure on Gaza's aquifer, drawing it down so far that seawater\u00a0is flowing in.\u00a0What is increasing the pressure on the aquifer are the billions of gallons pumped by Gaza's now debilitated citrus industry,\u00a0and the billions more\u00a0by Gaza's\u00a0Israeli\u00a0settlers,\u00a0who helped drain a sweet pocket of Gaza water before Israel\u00a0removed them\u00a0in 2005.\u00a0Now, barely\u00a0three percent\u00a0of Gaza's drinking water wells are fit for human consumption.The aquifer is badly contaminated with\u00a0disease-causing\u00a0nitrates from pesticide use, and from sewage which flows freely as Gaza's sewage plant is shut down for lack of electricity.And the desalinated drinking water used by two-thirds of Gazans, according to tests by the Palestinian Water Authority, is prone to faecal contamination,\u00a0causing more disease and\u00a0making it a severe risk for Gaza's children.Israel's bombing\u00a0of\u00a0water delivery infrastructure\u00a0-\u00a0including wells,\u00a0water\u00a0towers\u00a0and pipelines, and\u00a0sewage plants\u00a0-\u00a0in\u00a0the 2014 war,\u00a0made matters much worse.A\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0peace deal, in theory,\u00a0could have\u00a0eliminated the challenges by connecting\u00a0Gaza to the West Bank, where the vast Mountain Aquifer is\u00a0big enough to\u00a0drown\u00a0Gaza's water crisis.As it is, there is no peace. The\u00a0two territories are splintered, and Israel has effective control over all of the water\u00a0-\u00a0from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean.As a health epidemic looms,\u00a0experts, politicians, humanitarian officials and ordinary Gazans are left to debate the best way out of Gaza's water catastrophe.\"We have 15 percent of our water resources, and the rest is stolen by the Israelis,\"\u00a0says Mazen Al Banna, deputy minister for the Hamas government's water authority. As he speaks, the wail of an ambulance and a slow mournful dirge pass by the minister's Gaza City office - a memorial for three Gazans killed in Israeli air attacks the previous day. Decades ago,\u00a0Israel captured the Jordan River,\u00a0directing much of its flow\u00a0into Israel's National Water Carrier.Equally important, it controls the Mountain Aquifer,\u00a0exercising its power under the Oslo accords to prohibit Palestinians from drilling wells - even though the aquifer\u00a0lies almost entirely beneath the West Bank. \"And this is against international law,\" says Al\u00a0Banna.\u00a0\"I'm talking about Palestinian water rights. It is very important.\"Yet arguing for Palestinian water rights is akin to debating the right of return for Palestinian refugees.\u00a0It may be inscribed in international law, but it\u00a0remains a distant and faltering prospect within the current political reality.Instead, Hamas ministers and everyone else in Gaza must contend with Israel's ongoing economic siege,\u00a0which has restricted the movement of basic goods, including medical supplies\u00a0and crucial parts for water infrastructure.\"Occupation and siege are the primary impediments to the successful promotion of public health in the Gaza Strip,\" declared a 2018\u00a0study in\u00a0the\u00a0Lancet,\u00a0which cited \"significant and deleterious effects to health care.\" According to a 2017 report by the Israeli human rights group\u00a0B'tselem: \"During the siege, the health system has further deteriorated due to the lack of medical equipment, medicines, and rescue vehicles, and because of the frequent, prolonged power blackouts.\"The\u00a0Israeli\u00a0siege\u00a0sharply restricts the\u00a0movement of people and materials to and from Gaza - including \"dual-use\"\u00a0materials\u00a0it\u00a0claims\u00a0could\u00a0serve\u00a0both\u00a0civilian and military purposes. This is\u00a0a direct reason why\u00a0nearly half\u00a0the population is\u00a0unemployed,\u00a0and\u00a0an increasing number of Gazans - now\u00a0more than\u00a0three-quarters\u00a0of the population - are\u00a0dependent on humanitarian aid.\u00a0The blockade\u00a0has also delayed the entry of vital water infrastructure - in some cases, for years at a time. A proposed desalination plant for Gaza City, for example\u00a0- one of a series of proposed plants -\u00a0has been delayed since 2010 because of dual-use restrictions.\u00a0\"Eight years,\" says Yasmin Bashir, project coordinator for Gaza's Coastal Municipal Water Utility. \"We got the funding in 2012. This plant is supposed to serve the people who are suffering from bad quality, high salinity water.\" For years Bashir continued to submit \"a long list\" of material for Israeli approval, including pipes, pumps, and spare parts for the desalination plant. \"But because of the blockade and frequent closure, that delayed the material entry into Gaza.\" And that is just one project. \"We manage more than 25 projects nowadays,\" Bashir added.Now, even voices within Israel's military and security infrastructure are sounding warnings.\u00a0According to\u00a0a\u00a02017 report\u00a0by Israel's\u00a0Institute for National Security Studies, \"severe limits on access and movement imposed by Israel and Egypt have hindered post-conflict repair and reconstruction.\"\u00a0Israel's\u00a0long\u00a0list of dual-use items,\u00a0according\u00a0to the report, \"includes 23 essential items\" needed for Gaza's\u00a0WASH sector (water, sewage and hygiene), \"such as pumps, drilling equipment, and chemicals for water purification.\"A consensus is now emerging between\u00a0the Palestinian Authority, the UN, international donors, and\u00a0even, it appears, the Israeli army,\u00a0to establish a network of large desalination and sewage plants. This solution carries\u00a0an, at least, 500 million euro\u00a0price tag, and is years away from operation, at best - if it's ever built. \"Of course Gaza needs this project,\" says Rebhi al Sheikh, former deputy minister for the\u00a0Ramallah-based Palestinian Water Authority.\u00a0Others criticise the large, expensive development solution\u00a0as\u00a0inappropriate technology\u00a0for an impoverished population that would struggle to afford desalinated water.\u00a0\"The fantastic plans,\" says\u00a0Ramallah-based German hydrologist Clemens Messerschmid, fail to account for the fact that \"Gaza can't afford it. You just start crying if you look at the GDP.\"He argues that outside contractors, including in Israel, would be the biggest beneficiaries of the desalination\u00a0scheme. Perhaps more to the point, says Messerschmid, the amount of water to be produced by the plant won't\u00a0ultimately\u00a0meet Gaza's needs.\u00a0\"You don't reach these quantities under realistic conditions in Gaza.\"Yet the desalination plan appears to be gaining momentum.\u00a0The PA's concerns about Gaza's water crisis are joined by humanitarian agencies, foreign governments, and even,\u00a0it appears, an emergency response committee of the Israeli army.\u00a0In a Gaza Emergency Response document circulated to unnamed \"Friends and Colleagues,\" the Israeli army calls for \"an immediate humanitarian response\" to \"enhance the energy supply\" and \"increase the access to potable water\" in Gaza. Despite the\u00a0desalination push, a\u00a0pilot plant in southern Gaza\u00a0barely operates. A midday visit in late summer revealed a quiet plant; birds were\u00a0chirping\u00a0in the rafters above\u00a0the idle plant floor: no power. \"We don't have\u00a0more than four hours these days,\"\u00a0said\u00a0plant manager Kamal\u00a0Abu Moamar. \"But we hope.\"\u00a0He is waiting for his superiors, PA ministers to solve the problem. \"But we don't know how or when.\"Even if the plants are built, there's no guarantee they would remain standing. Some officials question whether\u00a0Israel would decide to bomb the desalination plants in the next Gaza war, just as\u00a0it\u00a0bombed Gaza's power plant\u00a0and other\u00a0critical infrastructure in previous wars.\u00a0\"Nobody can tell Israel that\u00a0you are doing the wrong thing,\" says Hamas's Al\u00a0Banna. \"Israel\u00a0is\u00a0doing everything against international law but nobody can prevent Israel doing everything she wants to do.\"In the \"Emergency Response\" document, the Israel army\u00a0endorses\u00a0the Gaza desalination plan, but so\u00a0far has offered no guarantees\u00a0it wouldn't target these plants in the next war.\u00a0Al Jazeera contacted an Israeli army spokesman a dozen times, but did not receive a response by time the of publishing.So the question\u00a0came\u00a0to Gregor von Medeazza, a UNICEF water and sanitation expert working in Gaza:\u00a0Under the circumstances,\u00a0is\u00a0investing hundreds of millions in donor\u00a0funds wasn't too big a risk?\"Any infrastructure is a risk\"\u00a0he said, \"[But] what is the way forward?\"Other risks abound, both with Gaza's water and\u00a0its\u00a0sewage, which flows into the sea at a rate of\u00a0110 million litres\u00a0a day.These risks flow well beyond Gaza's borders, flowing north in the currents.Gidon Bromberg, director of Ecopeace Middle East, based in Tel Aviv, said Gaza sewage led to the closure of Israeli beaches, and even at one point the shutdown of the desalination plant in Ashkelon, which supplies Israel with 15 percent of its drinking water.\u00a0Bromberg says\u00a0Israelis\u00a0cannot continue to ignore the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. He\u00a0called\u00a0it \"a\u00a0ticking time bomb\", and warned of an outbreak of pandemic disease - a direct consequence of Gaza's contaminated water. If that happens, Bromberg says, Gazans could flock to the fence on Israel's border - not \"with stones or rockets,\" but \"with buckets\", demanding clean water. \"God forbid if the military on either side, Israel or Egypt, starts shooting people approaching the fence, desperate for clean water.\"\r\n            SOURCE: Al Jazeera News\nThe Philippines\u2019 Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest storm ever to make landfall.
