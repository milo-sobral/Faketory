He wanted to give \u201cthe best food\u201d.\u00a0In his new book, We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time, Andres recounts the struggle of trying to provide aid to a US territory ravaged by storm and entangled in bureaucratic red tape.\nAndres founded the World Central Kitchen in 2010 after an earthquake rocked Haiti, using his personal and professional networks to secure resources and provide food\u00a0services to the devastated nation. But in Puerto Rico, he found himself frequently at odds with US government institutions\u00a0that, to him, seemed more concerned with playing politics than helping\u00a0the island\u2019s more than 3\u00a0million residents.\n\u201cEven with expanded numbers of military personnel, the troops were overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the challenge. Besides, those numbers weren\u2019t nearly as important as the 55 percent of Puerto Ricans who didn\u2019t have access to clean water,\u201d\u00a0he says in the book. \u201cThat represented 1.87 million Americans without the essential ingredient for life. Fully 95 percent of islanders still had no access to power.\u201d\nIn this episode, Jose Andres joins us to discuss the challenges of providing relief to Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria, and his efforts to do the same for those currently affected by subsequent storms.
