It would prevent the suspects from travelling abroad, where they may be arrested.\"They would have to remain in Saudi Arabia for the rest of their lives,\" he said.Stefano Maffei, University of ParmaBecause the murder involves diplomatic missions, the case is even more challenging to pursue.\"Embassy and consulate premises are inviolable,\" Schabas said, adding it was the reason why the killing allegedly took place there.This\u00a0inviolability led to Turkish investigators not being able to enter the Saudi consulate\u00a0for several days after the murder.However, Maffei said, immunity is only valid for the consulate building, not the people who work there.\"Being a diplomat does not allow you to kill anybody. If a diplomat is responsible for killing somebody, the country where the murder happened will have full jurisdiction to try that person,\" he said.\"But there is an additional problem. If the evidence of the murder is inside the consulate, the investigation would require Saudi Arabia's cooperation,\" Maffei added.Referring to the\u00a01963 Vienna Convention, Mef University's\u00a0Akyurek said:\u00a0\"Consular officers can be arrested or detained pending trial in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by the competent judicial authority.\"All 18 suspects in Khashoggi's killing are in Saudi Arabia, where they were arrested by Saudi authorities\u00a0for their alleged involvement, indicating Riyadh's attempt to try them itself.Five high-ranking members of the Saudi government have also been fired for their alleged ties to Khashoggi's murder.Following these arrests and dismissals, several organisations, including the United Nations and European Parliament, called for an independent investigation.But Maffei told Al Jazeera there is little chance of the case reaching an international body such as the International Criminal Court (ICC).\"The ICC jurisdiction is limited in situations where countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute,\" he said.For Schabas, the killing of a journalist inside a consulate does not constitute an international crime. \"It's just a murder,\" he said.\r\n            SOURCE:\r\n            Al Jazeera News\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\t\u00a0AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}
