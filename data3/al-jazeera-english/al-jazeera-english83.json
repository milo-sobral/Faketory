{"id": "Does Europe need its own army?", "paragraph": "Most Searched12 Nov 2018 21:22 GMT United States, Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, EuropeFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, have been at odds on many issues.This week, that divide stretched further when Macron appeared to call for the creation of a European army in an interview on French radio, saying that the continent could no longer rely on the support of the United States in defence matters.In the same interview, Macron also\u00a0spoke about cybersecurity threats and France having \"to protect [itself] with respect to China, Russia and even the United States\" - comments that were apparently taken out of context by many, including Trump, amid suggestions in media reports that the French president had named the three countries as military threats.But the two leaders differ on much more than just defence.Trump has pulled out of a number of global treaties, from the Paris climate agreement to the Iran nuclear deal\u00a0and\u00a0recently announced plans to withdraw from a decades-old nuclear disarmament treaty with Russia.Meanwhile, Macron has repeatedly emphasised the need for a global order and the rejection of nationalism.\u00a0He did so again during Sunday's remembrance ceremony in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.But can Europe do without the US in matters of defence?Presenter:\u00a0Richelle CareyGuests:\u00a0Renaud Girard - chief foreign correspondent at Le Figaro newspaperDavid DesRoches - associate professor at the National Defense University and former Pentagon officialGlenn Diesen - professor of international relations at Higher School of Economics in MoscowSource:\u00a0Al Jazeera NewsPresident Trump says it's time for the US to end the arms pact it signed with Russia more than 30 years ago.United States, Russia, US & Canada, Nuclear weaponsUS President Donald Trump accuses allies in the military alliance of failing to adequately pay for their protection.United States, Donald Trump\r\n      Commenting has been disabled.
