Since then, the world has been gripped by accounts of what may have happened to him.The mystery first unfolded through leaks by Turkish investigators. Reports emerged about a Saudi hit squad killing and dismembering the journalist - allegedly on the orders of the crown prince.After two weeks of Saudi denials, officials eventually said Khashoggi was \"mistakenly\" killed during a brawl in the consulate.But Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0contradicted that account, calling Khashoggi's death a \"savage\" and \"pre-meditated murder\". He called for an independent, credible investigation with accountability - from top to bottom.He also urged the kingdom to provide answers, especially on who gave the order to murder and where Khashoggi's remains are.But will those answers ever be provided?\u00a0Presenter: Sami ZeidanGuests:Giorgio Cafiero - Chief executive, Gulf State AnalyticsSinan Ulgen - Chairman, Centre for Economic & Foreign Policy StudiesMouin Rabbani - Senior fellow, Institute for Palestine StudiesSource:\u00a0Al Jazeera News\r\n      Commenting has been disabled.
