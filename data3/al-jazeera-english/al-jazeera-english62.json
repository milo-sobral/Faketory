Enthusiasm is high and voter turnout could reach record numbers.So far, in early voting, more than 30 million Americans have cast their ballots. But it is one group of swing voters that is expected to play a crucial role, and that is female voters, particularly white women.Many are outraged by the antics of President Donald Trump and his approach towards women.Last month, that anger turned into rage - after the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh - who is accused of sexual assault by several women.Now, with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 Senate seats up for grabs, the midterms will certainly shape the final two years of Trump's first term in office.So, what will be the role of swing voters - especially women - in this election?Presenter: Richelle CareyGuests:Ashley Pratte - Board member of Republican Women for Progress.Kira Lerner - Political reporter with ThinkProgress covering voting and election rights.Scott Lucas - Professor of political science and American Studies at the University of Birmingham.\u00a0Source:\u00a0Al Jazeera News\r\n      Commenting has been disabled.
