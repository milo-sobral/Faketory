It is time to start rebuilding Yemen, and Yemen will need every person in it to be rebuilt.\"Back from a recent visit to Yemen, the head of the UN World Food Programme warned that the country faced a full-blown famine in around six months.\"What I have seen in Yemen this week is the stuff of nightmares, of horror, of deprivation, of misery,\" David Beasley told the council. \"Children are already dying.\"Eight million people are affected by severe food shortages, according to UN officials, who warn that up to 14 million - or half of Yemen's population - are at risk of famine.\"One little child, I remember his little feet were sticking out of the blanket, and it was kind of cute, and I went and tickled the little feet thinking I'd get a little smile, and it was like tickling a ghost. Nothing there,\" he added.The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, began when the Yemeni government slashed fuel subsidies in the summer of 2014, prompting massive protests in Sanaa.The Houthis seized the opportunity and marched south from their stronghold of Saada province to the capital, where they toppled Hadi's government.Concerned by the rise of the Houthis, a Saudi-led military coalition, backed by the United States, intervened in 2015 with a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling Hadi's government.Since then, data collected by Al Jazeera and the Yemen Data Project has found that more than 18,000 air raids have been carried out in Yemen, with almost one-third of all bombing missions striking non-military sites.Weddings, funerals, schools and hospitals, as well as water and electricity plants, have been hit, killing and wounding thousands.\r\n            SOURCE:\r\n            Al Jazeera and news agencies\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\t\u00a0AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}
