They are so happy! Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!Trump has been upbeat on the denuclearisation progress so far, as well as over his relationship with Kim, whom he once called \"Little Rocket Man\".\"You got no rockets flying, you have no missiles flying, you have no nuclear testing,\" Trump said in the Oval Office last month.\u00a0\"We've made incredible progress - beyond incredible.\"But according to Fitzpatrick, the CSIS report is bound to embarrass Trump.\"I'm very pleased North Korea hasn't tested any more missiles, but while it hasn't tested them, it continues to produce them,\" Fitzpatrick said.\"Donald Trump, who declared everything is fine, now has egg on his face.\"Earlier this month, North Korea expressed dismay over tough US sanctions imposed on the country, warning that Pyongyang may revert to its former policy if the US did not change its stance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\t\u00a0AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}
