She has so far issued no public response.Once hailed as a champion in the fight for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi\u00a0has been stripped of a series of international honours over a Rohingya exodus that began in August 2017.More than 720,000 Rohingya fled the Buddhist majority's western Rakhine State in a military crackdown since August last year, with most seeking refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.Many are believed to have been either murdered or tortured and raped.Aung San Suu Kyi\u00a0and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party swept to power in 2015 in a landslide victory ending decades of military rule in the southeast Asian country of around 50 million.But her tenure has been marred by a failure to speak up for Rohingya, who were driven out of the country by the army in what the United Nations has called an ethnic cleansing campaign.Aung San Suu Kyi's administration rejected the UN findings\u00a0as one-sided, and said the military action was engaged in a legitimate operation against armed rebels.Last month, the 73-year-old was stripped of her honorary Canadian citizenship over her failure to speak up for the Rohingya.In March, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum rescinded its top award while other honours, including the freedom of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England, were also withdrawn.She has also lost numerous smaller awards from individual universities and local and regional governments.In 1991, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which many of her critics have also called to be withdrawn. The Swedish foundation that oversees the award has refused.Inside StoryWho can protect Rohingya returnees?\r\n            SOURCE:\r\n            Al Jazeera and news agencies\n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2018 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\t\u00a0AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}
