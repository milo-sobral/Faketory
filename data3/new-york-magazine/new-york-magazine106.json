We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          Sleep remedies, like sleep itself, are a bit mysterious. There are lots of reasons people can\u2019t sleep (full-blown insomnia, a natural tendency toward night owl-ishness, anxiety), but few concrete solutions. Google the problem, as one might desperately do at 2 a.m., and the WebMD-like sites that populate your results offer only vague endorsements or warnings.Putting prescription medications like Ambien and Lunesta aside, because that\u2019s another conversation entirely, we decided to ask two doctors and a holistic nutritionist about natural sleep remedies that they\u2019ve seen work. Here\u2019s what they recommend, and, crucially, how they recommend it.Probably the most popular over-the-counter sleep aid, melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone in our bodies that signals when it\u2019s time to relax and go to sleep. In supplement form, it can come in a capsule, liquid, or gummy. Melatonin gets thrown around a lot as something to take before bed or on a long flight, but it\u2019s specifically useful for people who are natural night owls, says Dr. Shelby Harris, a clinical psychologist who specializes in behavioral sleep medicine. \u201cFor those Circadian rhythm patients \u2014 let\u2019s take a delayed sleep person, a night owl \u2014 it helps to prime the system,\u201d she says. But: \u201cit takes a few weeks to work; it\u2019s meant to slowly drift your sleep schedule earlier.\u201d Harris recommends patients take a tiny dosage of 0.3 milligrams (\u201cMost people are buying 5, 10, 20 milligrams,\u201d she says, adding that more isn\u2019t better) about five hours before they\u2019d like to be asleep. That\u2019s enough time for the body to produce an earlier-than-usual hormonal signal, so that someone might drift off at 11 p.m. instead of 3 a.m.That\u2019s corroborated by Dr. Daniel Barone, a neurologist and sleep medicine expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian. Barone\u2019s book, Let\u2019s Talk About Sleep: A Guide to Understanding and Improving Your Slumber, includes a chapter on natural sleep remedies, one of which is melatonin. He adds that it can also be used a bit differently for people with \u201cgarden variety anxiety.\u201d \u201cMelatonin is kind of my go-to,\u201d he says. \u201cThe reason I start with it is because the brain does make melatonin. So you\u2019re just supplementing that to give it a push.\u201d For those patients, he suggests 1 to 3 milligrams, taken half an hour before bedtime.Supplements like melatonin aren\u2019t regulated by the FDA, but Both Harris and Barone say that patients should at least buy from brands with certification from the United States Pharmacopeia. Barone often recommends Twin Labs\u2019 product, seen here in 3 milligram dosages.He also trusts and recommends the brand Solgar. For people interested in taking the 0.3 milligrams Harris recommends, buying in liquid form would be smart \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find capsules with that small a dose.There\u2019s also a delayed release version of melatonin, for people who fall asleep easily but toss and turn in the night. Not insomniacs (as doctors, both Barone and Harris made it clear that insomnia should be addressed with a professional), just poor sleepers.This section will be short: Harris said she\u2019s had patients try valerian (derived from the root of the valerian flower) but hasn\u2019t heard of or treated a single case in which it was successful. Barone said more or less the same thing. \u201cThey say it\u2019s to help relax the central nervous system, which, what does that even mean?\u201d he said.For a more holistic set of recommendations, we decided to include input form a holistic nutritionist as well. Daphne Javitch, who practices in New York and runs the moment-of-zen Instagram account @doingwell, says that besides exercise, diet, routine, and making sure your room is cold and dark, there\u2019s magnesium. The mineral is available in plethora of healthy foods (dark leafy greens, whole grains) but most Americans have some kind of deficiency. Which isn\u2019t ideal for getting rest, because magnesium helps to keep stress levels down in the body \u2014 something Harris confirmed as well.You can take it in capsule form, and Pure is a reliable brand. One of the perks of taking a magnesium supplement is that while no doctor or nutritionist will tell you that it puts you to sleep, it can help lead to a deeper sleep.Javitch recommends this supplement that comes in drink form: \u201cIt\u2019s an anti-stress, calming concoction, basically, and it also helps with constipation and things like that. It kind of gives you that feeling of preparing for sleep rather than knocking you out.\u201d Similarly to how Harris recommends using melatonin, Javitch suggests leaning on supplements in times of transition, with the idea of letting your body establish a natural rhythm.\u201cPutting some magnesium epsom salts in a bath is a really good thing,\u201d Javitch says. \u201cIt\u2019s super-detoxing and super relaxing \u2014 it gives that you feeling of being exhausted after you\u2019ve gone for a long swim. It\u2019s a comfortable kind of exhaustion.\u201d\u201cAnother great natural sleep aid is an orgasm,\u201d Javitch says. \u201cFor both men and women, after you have that release you\u2019ll be more relaxed.\u201dWith that sound advice in mind, here\u2019s the Maude Vibe, which we deemed the best-in-show vibrator.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
