{"id": "The Best Coffee Beans, According to Writers and Novelists (Who Drink a Lot of Coffee)", "paragraph": "There\u2019s no shortage of coffee-obsessed writers. Tom Wolfe, for instance, would drink \u201cawesome quantities\u201d of coffee at midnight before launching into long stretches of late-night writing, while L. Frank Baum, author of The Wizard of Oz and dozens of other fantasy books, would drink four or five coffees with breakfast (all of this according to Mason Currey\u2019s Daily Rituals). So when we started looking for the best coffee beans, we figured writers and authors would be some of the most qualified people to make recommendations \u2014\u00a0and we were not disappointed by their picks. Here, nine writers and authors on their must-have, all-time-favorite coffee beans, ranging from readily-available, grocery store beans to seasonal roasts that are hoarded for later.\u201cMy favorite brand is Caf\u00e9 Bustelo. I\u2019m 100 percent Colombian, so of course I\u2019m a coffee drinker. When I was younger, I had it the Colombian way my mom made it: hot milk poured into Nescaf\u00e9 instant, with lots of sugar. Now, I make espresso, add a little milk, a touch of sugar, and I\u2019m good to go.\u201d \u2014\u00a0R.J. Palacio, author of Wonder\u201cI have tried everything: small-batch, breeze-cooled brews from Bolinas; I brought home beans from Beirut. But after years of searching, I realized it\u2019s been in front of me all along: Lavazza Dark Roast. You can get it at Eataly. It\u2019s bold, and it scoops me out of my caffeine deficit and places me in the chair like the Jolly Bean Giant. I brew it in a Cuisinart machine that turned up at my house one day and hasn\u2019t broken yet. Does the trick.\u201d \u2014 John Freeman, writer, literary critic and editor of Freeman\u2019s\u201cAs a writer of dark fantasy novels, I naturally drink the Green Mountain Coffee roasters\u2019 Dark Magic coffee, an espresso-like brew that comes from my home state of Vermont and has a flavor reminiscent of dark chocolate. Its tasting notes are described as, \u2018Spellbinding complexity. Deep, dark, and intense\u2019 \u2014 qualities I love in both my cup of coffee and in my books.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Laurie Forest, author of The Black Witch ChroniclesEditor\u2019s Note: Forest uses a Keurig to make her coffee, but if you don\u2019t have a single-serve coffee machine, or just prefer another brewing method, this roast of Green Mountain Coffee also comes as a bag of beans.\u201cCoffee is one of my favorite topics. Actually, coffee is one of my favorite things. For a while I was addicted to Handsome Coffee\u2019s Dandy Espresso, but then they got acquired by Blue Bottle, who got acquired by Nestl\u00e9.\u00a0So I went on a tasting expedition. I\u2019ve tried beans from most of the independent west coast coffee roasters, and while many of them are tasty, there is one that is my absolute favorite. It\u2019s the Myanmar Lay Ywar single-origin beans from Portola Coffee Lab. (In a pinch, I use their Nkonge Lot 41 beans from Burundi or their Terra Incognita Espresso roast.)\u00a0It\u2019s a fairly light roast with a nice berry, lemongrass note on top of a dark cacao funk. It\u2019s got layers of flavor and it is delicious. I\u2019ve never tasted a coffee like it.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Mark Haskell Smith, author and novelist, most recently of Blown\u201cI haven\u2019t always been a coffee drinker. In fact, I used to depend on diet sodas to fuel my writing process. It started out with one soda in the morning and that led to three by the end of the day. Encouraged (forced) by my husband to read about how potentially horrible diet sodas were for me, feet dragging, I made the switch to coffee. Peet\u2019s Coffee\u2019s Major Dickason\u2019s Blend, to be specific \u2014 rich, smooth, and complex, with a very full body and a multi-layered character. While I (really) miss the bubbles, I\u2019m now a true convert. Two cups in the morning with a dash of vanilla soy creamer and I can actually feel my brain tighten, thoughts begin to buzz, caffeine soldiers march through my body, and I\u2019m off on a writing jag that lasts the entire day.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Nancy Richardson Fischer, author of When Elephants Fly\u201cEvery year, October brings three of my favorite things: Halloween, candy, and Peet\u2019s Holiday Blend coffee. To create its famous roast, Peet\u2019s uses the best beans of the season, then layers in chocolate and just a touch of citrus. Think: the Mexican hot chocolate you drank once at a street fair and have never since forgotten. Think: a coffee aroma rich enough to get a Minnesotan like me out of bed on even our coldest days. Think: two months of coffee bliss. Tempted? Act now. January comes quickly.\u201d \u2014 Gretchen Anthony, author of Evergreen Tidings from the Baumgartners\u201cI get my coffee from the Algerian Coffee Store on Old Compton Street in London\u2019s Soho because they do the best water-processed decaf Colombian, and my brain whirs too fast if too caffeinated. I also love Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. I only tend to have one cup a day and I definitely savor it as a moment to settle down and start work.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Elizabeth Foley, co-author of What Would Cleopatra Do?: Life Lessons From 50 of History\u2019s Most Extraordinary Women\u201cEvery time I am in New York, I buy a bag of coffee beans from Zibetto on 6th Avenue, which is always a big hit when I bring it home.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Markus Zusak, author of Bridge of Clay\u201cI buy beans at Cafe Mogador and grind them and drink it at home. I think their coffee\u2019s sweet and I jack up the sweetness by shaking some cinnamon in before I do a pour-over in a Chemex pot. Sometimes the only happy thought I have is that tomorrow, I can wake up and drink coffee.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Eileen Myles, poet, novelist, public talker, art journalist, and author of 21 books including, most recently, evolution and Afterglow (a dog memoir)The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
