{"id": "The Best Computer Monitors on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy (like pillows), but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written before about other computer accessories before like, laptop cases, external hard drives, and expert-recommended ergonomic keyboards and mouses, here we\u2019ve rounded up the best-reviewed monitors on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\ufeff\u201cGreat monitor! I was little hesitant at first because its specs, such as contrast ratio and response time, seemed a little lower than others. I\u2019m an avid gamer who needed a new monitor right before college that wouldn\u2019t burn a hole in my pocket. Very happy with what I got. I also thought 21.5\u201d was a little small for gaming, but it\u2019s pretty big in person and it\u2019ll definitely satisfy anyone who wants to watch movies or play games often. After about a month\u2019s use, I\u2019ve encountered no problems, and only see quality!\u201d\u201cI use this when working from home and, in comparison to what I\u2019m accustomed to in the office, this is a phenomenal upgrade. Typically while at work I have to run dual monitors\u00a0and I still experience difficulties toggling between windows, applications, etc. When at home the higher resolution of this monitor allows me to get more done in fewer clicks, increasing productivity and of course creating a better experience.\u201d\u201cFantastic monitor. A lot bigger in person. The width, curve, and resolution make for a fantastically immersive experience. The level-of-detail increase over my previous monitor is amazing. I\u2019m looking at my games completely different now and I am constantly amazed at the difference and feel. Everything is so fluid.\u201d\u201cThis is without a doubt the best monitor I have ever owned. It is stylish and sleek yet affordably priced. Unpacking it and setting it up was a breeze. I spent a few minutes tweaking the display settings to my liking and was immediately blown away by how crisp and sharp the images were. Even the computer wallpaper I\u2019ve stared at for months suddenly revealed new details that I had never seen before!\u201d\u201cWow. I can\u2019t believe the quality of the screen for the price I paid. Color reproduction is outstanding. The curve \u2026 oh the curve \u2026 I\u2019ll never buy a flat screen again! Curve is the way to go. I use this for work, gaming, and Photoshop. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had this monitor a month now and I love it. The joystick button makes navigating the menu so easy. The built-in speakers actually sound very good for watching TV and movies, and playing games so I\u2019m not even using external speakers. The viewing angle is such that I can see the screen perfectly no matter where I am in relation to the monitor. Like other reviews have said, this monitor is simply amazing.\u201d\u201cFor productivity, this thing is a major boost to my workflow with enough screen real estate to put up three full-sized windows for browsing, word-processing, etc. For gaming, the extra width gives a much more immersive effect no matter what game you play, provided it supports ultra-wide resolution (which most do nowadays). I have only a very little bit of light bleed in one corner, but hardly visible, no dead pixels, and the color calibration is outstanding right from the factory.\u201d\u201cI think this is the best competitive first-person shooter monitor available to date. I don\u2019t have the precise terms to describe it but if you thought 144Hz is the human limit for perceiving smooth motion you\u2019re simply mistaken. It\u2019s one thing to not want to spend the money for a monitor like this, it\u2019s something else to incorrectly claim there is virtually no difference. If you have a serious mind-set for competitive first-person shooter games I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret buying this monitor.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t had Alienware stuff in a long time. I\u2019m glad to have bought this, the 240Hz [refresh rate] has help me be able to game a lot better. I perform better, the color is amazing, and so far I haven\u2019t had any problems with the monitor. I\u2019m looking forward to buying their new ones in the future once they get released.\u201d\u201cI am very happy with the monitor. The colors are just beautiful on this one and watching nature documentaries is a pure pleasure, especially at night at full brightness. The brightness can be pushed to very high values and it is enough to make working in the afternoon very comfortable. I am a scientist and reading research papers with vectors graphics is really nice; mathematical equations never looked so pretty. I have been so spoiled by this sharpness and clarity that other HD screens now look very dull and reading on them is not comfortable at all.\u201d\u201cWorking on my computer now has changed. The Acer monitor is large enough for complex spreadsheets, Word docs, presentation, and every business task. But watching videos, movies, and games is an exceptional experience. Having full HD and sharp picture is a real pleasure. Easy to install and optimize. Highly recommended.\u201d\u201cAll I can say is: Wow, what a great product! I\u2019ve only had it for a couple days, but I love it. The picture is crisp, clear, and bright, with no dead pixels, and the touch feature is quite responsive and does indeed register all ten of my fingers when they are placed on its surface simultaneously. This monitor allows me, at the risk of sounding like a weirdo, to become more intimate with my computer. I\u2019ve got it set up as the main display with an older Dell monitor to its immediate right for a sweet dual monitor setup, and as it stands, I can\u2019t really think of any complaints.\u201d\u201cI purchased two of these monitors to pair with small computers in a retail-shop setting. I\u2019m very pleased! I don\u2019t know all the tech jargon but the displays are very clear, bright, and easy on the eyes. The touch is very responsive \u2014 it may take some getting used to as it is quite different than my laptop touch screen, but that\u2019s not a problem at all. For the price, there is no comparison.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
