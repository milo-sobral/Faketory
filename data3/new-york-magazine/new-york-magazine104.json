We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          There\u2019s something so glamorous \u2014 and comfortable \u2014 about the idea of slipping into silk just to go to bed. But for most people, an old T-shirt and ratty (but beloved) soft pants do the job of pajamas just fine, and venturing into the world of matching silk sets can be intimidating. To help you dip your toes into what is definitely a luxury market, we spoke to lingerie experts, boutique owners, and all-around stylish women about their favorites.Gabriella Pelletier, buyer at Lisa Says Gah, loves the silk sleepwear from the Sleeper, a new brand based in Kiev, Ukraine. \u201cThey are so whimsical and aspirational yet also extremely practical as separates in daily life when you\u2019re not dreaming,\u201d says Pelletier. \u201cSleeper provides ultrafeminine cuts with practicality if you decide to pair your silk pajama shirt with your favorite pair of vintage Levi\u2019s and a blazer.\u201dTry this highly rated, 100 percent silk set available on Amazon in \u201cbarely pink\u201d for a similar vibe and a fraction of the price.Pelletier also recommends Sleeper\u2019s nightgowns: \u201cThey can double as everyday casual dresses with a chunky cardigan and an ankle boot.\u201dAccording to Cora Harrington of the Lingerie Addict, \u201cU.K. luxury loungewear label Violent & Wren creates some of the best prints, and their silk is incredibly lush \u2014 plush, sumptuous, and soft to the touch \u2014 just like what you\u2019d expect from silk PJs.\u201d Julie McConnell, senior buyer at Journelle, agrees: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t travel someplace warm, these tropical PJs are the next best thing.\u201dEqually as swingy \u2014 and just a tad less loud \u2014 are these charmeuse silk pants we\u2019d love to slip on to spend a snowy weekend curled up with a good book.According to industry expert Ellen Lewis of Lingerie Briefs, British brands are making some of her favorite silk sleepwear: \u201cI think the British acumen with print and their expertise in tailoring set them apart, particularly in the luxury market. I love the kitschy British vibe.\u201d In addition to Violet and Wren, Lewis likes Asceno for its use of classic stripes and geometrics. McConnell is also a fan of Asceno\u2019s menswear-inspired pieces.Andy Spade\u2019s sleepwear line Sleepy Jones is a Strategist favorite (having been recommended by the likes of Karlie Kloss, writer Hermione Hoby, and designer Casey Larkin Blond of Mr. Larkin), and their silk offerings are just as cozy. Try (another) menswear-inspired top that can do double duty as a regular shirt.Or this short-sleeved number that\u2019s over 50 percent off.If you\u2019ve seen Julian Schnabel around town sporting PJs, chances are he\u2019s wearing Olatz, which happens to be his ex-wife Olatz L\u00f3pez Garmendia\u2019s  brand. You, too, can cop his look, as these silk pajamas are truly unisex.Another British favorite of Lewis\u2019s is Olivia von Halle for the brand\u2019s \u201clarger- than-life chic motifs.\u201d This chartreuse set printed with tigers certainly makes a statement.For something a bit more understated (and affordable), try this sweet floral-printed set from Macy\u2019s.Natori\u2019s floral PJ set seems like a steal at $90.Owner of Minneapolis-based boutique Mille Michelle LeBlanc loves the silk PJs from the Glad Hours: \u201cI love their 1920s inspired take on classic silk pajamas. The wide-leg pant and acid hue feels extra chic.\u201d This oversize set is made from 100 percent crepe de chine silk.\u201cThe one element I find emerging of great interest is washed silk,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cOf note here is Lunya, an American sleepwear brand that develops its own fabrics, including a silk that\u2019s machine washable. Ever consider wearing a silk jumpsuit to bed?This dotted one-piece hardly looks like sleepwear.Lewis also recommends Italian brand F.R.S. For Restless Sleepers for its innovative shapes and prints: \u201cOne questions if these designs are silk sculpture.\u201dWe love the stripes on this Art Deco-inspired silk robe by Morgan Lane that\u2019s a fraction of the price.Another brand that Lewis likes is Canadian company Christine Lingerie. \u201cThese are classic cuts, again in extraordinary prints as well as solids,\u201d she says. Here\u2019s an elegant robe that will never go out of style.For something a little more affordable, Lewis recommends Australian company Ginia. This sweet lace-trimmed cami, paired with a leather moto jacket, would work outside of the bedroom as well.This flirty camisole-and-tap-short set (sold separately) is 60 percent off.Lewis also likes Skin for its silk offerings. This midi-length chemise can just as easily be worn to bed or out.Cindy Kahng, owner of the East Village boutique Azaleas, loves this vintage-inspired washed georgette-silk slip from Araks that\u2019s great for \u201cindoor sports as well as pairing with an oversized cardigan for a night on the town.\u201d The delicate pin tucks make all the difference.Khang is also a fan of the silk sleepwear from Maison Du Jour. This crepe de chine top is over half off.Pair with these sporty shorts, also on sale.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
