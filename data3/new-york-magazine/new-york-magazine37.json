{"id": "The Best Memory-Foam Pillows on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written before about microwaveable pillows, travel pillows, and pillows for neck pain, here we\u2019ve done a deep dive into a variety of memory-foam pillows and rounded up the best ones available on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI purchased two king Eden pillows and received them a couple of weeks ago. They are soft enough to be comfortable and firm enough not to flatten out, so that\u2019s a big plus. My husband can fall asleep quickly, and now I do as well. I sleep all night and wake up without any aches or stiffness. Even caught the dog under the covers, resting her head on my husband\u2019s pillow after he got up this morning. She gives a paws-up, too!! We are very pleased and would definitely recommend.\u201d\u201cI am overjoyed with this pillow! I sleep very warm, and in fact, typically overheat at night, no matter the temperature. Your pillow is keeping me cool, and it is so very comfortable! My neck and shoulders are feeling much better, and I believe that the support has helped me mitigate the number of severe headaches I was having.\u201d\u201cAbout two years ago, I bought a Tuft & Needle bed. At the time, I asked if they had pillows, and I was told they were working on it. I\u2019m 63 and have slept in quite a few beds, and nothing compares to the T&N. I had my neck fused the beginning of September, and it has been very uncomfortable to find a good position to sleep with my old really comfy pillow. I felt like I was fighting with my old pillow all night. Last night I just lay my head down, and the pillow knew exactly what to do. I\u2019m going to buy another one. Expensive but totally worth it.\u201d\u201cThis is the best pillow I\u2019ve ever owned. The foam is soft, but firm enough to provide more than adequate support for my neck. I suffer from a lot of neck and lower-back pain, and this pillow has helped me sleep so much better. I keep a pillowcase on mine, but have at times taken the pillow\u2019s cover off and washed it with my pillowcases for thorough cleaning. It is a little difficult to shimmy the cover back over the foam pillow, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing because it means the cover hugs the pillow well and is basically unnoticeable under a pillowcase.\u201d\u201cBought this wedge pillow to try before buying an adjustable bed, to see if the inclined position would help improve sleep. And did it work!!! Husband has never slept more soundly in months, and wakes without any back pain, a previously very frequent complaint. Decided to save the money for an adjustable bed/mattress because this has worked so well, and is portable! I\u2019m a side sleeper, however, and it doesn\u2019t work well for me. But I use it instead to elevate my feet slightly, and it works great.\u201d\u201cI have suffered with acid reflux since I was 13 (sadly, it runs in my family), and I have done everything under the sun to help, and nothing (other than changing my eating habits), NOTHING has helped as much as this pillow. It offers the perfect amount of support, it\u2019s comfortable, and doesn\u2019t overheat you. I sleep on my back and my side\u2019s, and it\u2019s great in any position. I\u2019ve had it for almost a year and it\u2019s money well-spent!\u201d\u201cThis little pillow is great. Had been told after hip surgery by my doctor to put a pillow between my knees. This was somewhat difficult due to size of pillow. This little molded pillow does the job perfectly without the bulk. My back feels better, too. I plan to use this knee pillow from now on. Therapist says it keeps spine better aligned when sleeping, a good thing to aid one with spinal problems.\u201d\u201cI use the travel cushion at home watching TV in my recliner and in bed before dozing off for the night, I take it with me when I go to the dentist to support my neck and shoulders. I had cervical spinal-cord surgery last August; this is a very soft and comfy cervical pillow. I plan to buy another one! The cover has a zipper, so you can machine-wash the cover, and the cover also has an elastic handle for easy carrying.\u201d\u201cI have pretty severe neck problems and use neck pillows in the car, in my chair, on planes. Decided to try for our latest long flight, and I am very happy with it. When you wrap it around, you can tuck it nicely under your chin in the front, or side, and it supports your head very nicely. Also works great if you have a window seat. You can wrap and lean against it. I am so glad I decided to try this pillow, definitely a step up from the one\u2019s you find in airport stores and most stores in general. Give it a try!\u201d\u201cBefore ordering this pillow, I was waking up with a stiff, sore neck every morning. I\u2019ve now slept on it for eight nights and my neck has been feeling so much better! I was worried it was going to be too full of a pillow when it arrived, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that the center part could be removed to adjust the fullness \u2026 absolutely brilliant!\u201d\u201cDid you ever get something that you never knew that you needed or even wanted? Once you got it, you absolutely loved it \u2026 that\u2019s how I feel about the Coop Body Pillow.This pillow is the ideal blend of firmness and softness. I find that I\u2019m not waking up in the middle of the night and that I\u2019m able to sleep longer as well. I mostly sleep on my back, and it can be used just like a standard pillow. For reading or watching TV in bed; I prop it up with a regular pillow.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
