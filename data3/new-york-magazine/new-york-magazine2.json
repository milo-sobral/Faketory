{"id": "What Rebel Wilson Can\u2019t Live Without", "paragraph": "If you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ve probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the\u00a0hand sanitizer\u00a0and the\u00a0electric toothbrush. We asked actress Rebel Wilson, who has a new collaboration called Rebel Wilson x Angels, about the bubble bath, sunglasses, and comfortable but fancy flats she can\u2019t live without.I am obsessed with bubble baths. I\u2019m always thinking of new ways to end the day that aren\u2019t ice cream or brownies. I love this oil because it\u2019s got valerian and hops in it, so it\u2019s a nice way to tell your body that it\u2019s time to unwind and go to sleep. I\u2019ll also put some Epsom salts in the bath with it for detoxing. But more about this blue stuff. I don\u2019t even know how to say it! Neep? Kin-neep? Something else that\u2019s great about it is that it turns the water blue. How great is that?I used to wear the big, chunky ones that went over your head, but those hurt my ears after a long time, so I switched to the wireless buds, and it\u2019s so much more comfortable. I\u2019m always listening to something in an Uber or on a flight, especially podcasts. Right now, I\u2019m very into Scriptnotes, which is a podcast about script-writing and the process of creating plot and dialogue. I\u2019m writing myself, so it\u2019s nice to be able to hear about how people do it just because it can be so solitary. I actually just bought a new pair of these headphones though. I left my original ones in a car, accidentally, and I tried to contact the driver, but he never answered. Aren\u2019t they supposed to let you know? Like, \u201cHey, I have your headphones, come get them.\u201d Thankfully, I used an alias, so some random person\u2019s not walking around going, \u201cI have Rebel Wilson\u2019s headphones!\u201dIf you ever see me in a paparazzi picture, I am wearing these sunglasses. They\u2019re so lightweight, and you can wear them anywhere. I learned about them from Paul Feig of all people. I hate heavy sunglasses that put pressure on your nose, but these are so stylish and lightweight at the same time. Everyone who sees them asks, \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201dHave you heard of this? I do this on the weekend when I\u2019m sun-baking outside to strengthen my hair. It\u2019s always getting styled for work, which can be so damaging. Last year, I filmed three movies back-to-back, and my hair was like a third of what it was. In the past, I\u2019ve tried to use a wig, but they can get so hot, so I was looking for other things, and someone told me about this protein treatment that you put in your hair to strengthen it, and I figured, why not? It\u2019s apparently a big thing in London, which is where I got it (and good for guys and girls). Anyway, I leave it on my scalp for 20 to 30 minutes \u2014 or even four hours if I\u2019m just hanging around all afternoon, and it helps with everything. It\u2019s thickened my hair and stopped it from breaking as much. My hairdresser, unprompted, said to me, \u201cWow, whatever you\u2019re doing\u2019s made a huge difference.\u201dMy family is so cute. For Christmas, this mask is all I get. My grandma will get me one. My uncle will get me one. I got a 20-pack at the airport the other day because they\u2019re cheaper when you buy in bulk. I truly cannot get enough. It\u2019s an essential if I\u2019m on a long flight or before a big day of filming or an event. It\u2019s a mask that gives you that hydrated, glowy skin because it has the Japanese Pitera ingredient derived from yeast. And you know, Cate Blanchett is the spokesperson, and look at her skin. It\u2019s incredibly plumping. I sound like I\u2019m on the Home Shopping Network.I love that Cowshed has all of these funny names for its products. I saw this one and thought, Oh, yeah, that\u2019s it. I got it because of the name, but the lotion actually has the best scent. It really is seductive. There\u2019s nothing like hugging someone and having them say, \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d And I don\u2019t say, \u201cHORNY COW,\u201d but I\u2019ll think to myself, Oh, it\u2019s definitely working. It\u2019s kind of got a floral, feminine smell to it. It\u2019s a bit sexy.Nicholas Kirkwood is a British designer, and I don\u2019t know how I found these shoes, but my stylist once told me that it would be so much more flattering to have a pointed toe for feet like mine, which are quite small, so that stuck with me. I hate wearing high heels, and these flats are really stylish, but super comfortable. I became so obsessed with them that I bought them in every color.I always have this in my handbag. My makeup artist Martine actually gave it to me, and at first I was like, \u201cYou just want me to use ChapStick?\u201d But it\u2019s really the most comfortable thing to have on your lips. I hate having dry lips, and this keeps your lips moisturized, but with a bit of tint, so it looks like your lips but just extremely enhanced rather than like makeup. And if I lose it, I can just go to CVS and get another one, which is my favorite part.It\u2019s exciting to make your own stuff! I wanted to make something affordable and accessible to everyone, and these T-shirts are just great for every day. They\u2019re made of this comfortable material that\u2019s nice with jeans. My favorite is the one that says, \u201cToday Is My Lucky Day.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m so lucky anyway, but I like wearing it and putting it out there. I actually made up all the slogans on the tees.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
