{"id": "The Best Body Serums for Moisturizing Dry Winter Skin, According to Dermatologists", "paragraph": "As seasons change and central heating returns, now\u2019s the time everyone is scrambling for new ways to moisturize reptilian skin. Recently, we\u2019ve been hearing some buzz around body serums, which are similar to serums for the face, only they\u2019re meant to moisturize and even exfoliate the dry bits on your legs, arms, and back.\u201cJust like serums for the face, serums for the body offer a great way to deliver more active ingredients to the skin,\u201d explains New York dermatologist Hadley King, a clinical instructor of dermatology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. The extra skin-care step is helpful, she says, because though \u201csome body lotions also contain active ingredients, body serums often have higher concentrations of these ingredients.\u201d\u00a0But the two aren\u2019t interchangeable, and for best results should be used one after the other, layered lightest to heaviest (the serum before the lotion). Here, we asked dermatologists to help us sort through which ones are worth buying.We\u2019ve covered One Love Organics before for their cult-y cleansing oil, but their body serum is\u00a0another good one to know if you don\u2019t want to spend too much money, or time applying it. This one\u2019s unique in that it comes in a spray bottle, so dermatologist Noelani Gonzalez, the director of Cosmetic Dermatology at Mount Sinai West, says it\u2019s fast and easy to use, ideal for someone who\u2019s short on time. \u201cIt also has pumpkin seed oil, a natural source of salicylic acid which helps exfoliate,\u201d and she adds that generally essential oils are a must for those looking to plump and hydrate their skin.If you want a body serum that exfoliates, Gonzalez and King like this Ren body serum which contains alpha-hydroxy acids (like lactic acid) and essential oils. \u201cGentle chemical exfoliation helps to slough off dry dead skin cells, leaving the skin softer and smoother,\u201d King says, and \u201cthe lactic acid in this gently gets rid of dead skin cells without any scrubbing.\u201dFor someone looking for something a bit cheaper, we have options for you, too. You can find this Vaseline deep repair serum in your local drugstore, and Gonzalez says it works because for hydrating because \u201cit has elastomers which help smooth skin and the vaseline jelly creates a protective layer for your skin.\u201dSpeaking of hydration, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to double down with some hyaluronic acid, which both experts said was an important humectant for plumping skin and retaining moisture. One hyaluronic acid product King likes is this luxurious serum\u2013slash\u2013body milk from French pharmacy brand Vichy that contains ten essential oils.\u201cDepending on what your concerns are, you can look for ingredients like Vitamin C and E, which are anti-aging and act as antioxidants,\u201d says Gonzalez.\u00a0\u201cThey help protect your skin from UV radiation and pollution \u2014 these environmental stressors can speed up the aging process.\u201d In that vein, we\u2019d suggest this Moroccanoil that contains vitamin C, plus antioxidant-rich argan oil. And if it\u2019s anything like Moroccanoil\u2019s hair products, it\u2019s going to smell delightfully fragrant.And though this one has a steep price point, Gonzalez says it\u2019s very promising for people hoping to lighten up dark spots and melasma. \u201cIt has tranexamic acid in it, an ingredient that has been shown to improve melasma and dark spots in a few clinical studies.\u201dAnd this is the body serum we\u2019ve been using from Lily de Mai. It\u2019s unscented and specifically catered to sensitive skin, so it might be a good one to try if you\u2019re prone to body breakouts and rashes. We like that it contains a blend of omega-3 oils and antioxidant-rich plant oils (which feels decadent after a hot shower) plus ceramides (which derms tend to love for restoring the skin barrier).The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
