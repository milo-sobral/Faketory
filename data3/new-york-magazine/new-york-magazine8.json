There are a bunch of great deals to be had right now: Everlane just replenished its selection of sale items, Bandier is having a 20 percent off Friends & Family sale (which applies on top of already discounted things), plus Nordstrom Rack has a bunch of great loungewear we want to wear through January.

We love the stuff from ecoconscious brand Alternative.And if you\u2019re looking for something a bit splashier, these would be fun with a simple T-shirt.North Face makes a great puffy vest for layering under your favorite wool coats (in the event that you\u2019re not looking to go full gorp).We wouldn\u2019t tie up all the strings on this kimono jacket, but keeping it in the office as an extra layering piece is a stellar idea.As far as comfortable shoes go, few things touch the orthopedic credibility of Clarks. We like the actual look of these Terris (though we might want to cut off that little leather tassel once we get them).A pair of medium-height shoes that you could wear to brunch, to work, to a party and look totally at ease.We love how tailored this North Face hoodie is \u2014 it almost doesn\u2019t look like North Face at all.Have you heard?

This one\u2019s got some nice yarn-dyed fabric, too.Another good layering piece for any winter travels you might have coming up (notice the flattering diagonal quilts along the torso).We love a cactus, but sometimes even they\u2019re too high-maintenance. Best to go with a faux version.We love the smell of Murchison-Hume (see here) and would have the freshest house with this clean starter kit featuring four products: Counter Safe All-Purpose Surface Cleaner, Boys\u2019 Bathroom Cleaner, Heirloom Dish Soap, and Premium Glass Cleaner.Just the sweetest thing tied around a glum handbag.Another contender for \u201cthe sweater I keep at my desk when the office thermostat is set to kill me.\u201dA very striking-looking curling iron from California-based luxury hair-tool brand T3.This cozy cardigan is the one you would wanna keep in the closet for weekends when you don\u2019t plan to leave the apartment.Our favorite rain boots right now are Chelsea ones (no muss, no fuss!), and we just love the pointed toe and matte look on this pair.We like how Everlane does slightly turned-up versions of the basics \u2014 this is a hoodie, but, like, a sophisticated hoodie.Get your extremely charming and menswear-inspired pj\u2019s on sale here!A seven-inch chef knife from German brand Henckels for a fraction of its original price.The funniest little planter (we look at the mustache and laugh) that you could store pencils and pens in, too.A long wallet that\u2019s almost like a party dress \u2014 the wide stripes with just a bit of sheen add a festive touch.The band collar on this cotton shirt gives it just a bit of an unexpected silhouette.Bandier is having a big Friends & Family sale on its site right now (everything\u2019s an additional 20 percent off in your cart), including on these interesting-looking leggings.Here\u2019s another pair of workout tights that are all-black save for a few bands of color at the ankle.Why get real animal skin when you can get an adorable faux hide bath mat?A super work bag that\u2019s reversible and also celebrity-endorsed.
