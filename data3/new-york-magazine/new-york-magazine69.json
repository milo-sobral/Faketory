{"id": "The Best Bedside Lamps on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy (like pillows), but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written before about other bedroom essentials like nightstands, headboards, and dressers,\u00a0here we\u2019ve rounded up the best-reviewed bedside lamps on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cThis lamp is honestly one of my favorite purchases of the year. It it sleek and simple to use; and bright, dim, or colorful, depending on what I want. The touch-sensitive base works very well. I love it so much I bought two for my small room and have them both rotating through colors opposite each other. Creates a very cool atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.\u201d\u201cAfter browsing page after page for a bedroom light, I came upon this little gem. The Lucerna fit every criteria I was looking for. It has a small footprint, isn\u2019t too bright (I don\u2019t need to light up the room, just the area near my bed), and matches the room color scheme. The biggest selling point for me is the touch on/off. Highly recommended!\u201d\u201cThis is the perfect bedside lamp\u2013just the right size. What I love most is that the shape and size of the shade ensures you are not blinded by the glare of the bulb because the light is directed upward. Plenty of light with the included bulb to read. What my guest love most is the easy access to the USB port for charging their phones.\u201d\u201cI ordered two of these, in different colors, for my children\u2019s rooms and they did not disappoint. For the price they are exactly what we were looking for in terms of quality and ease of use. These are the only lights in my children\u2019s rooms and they still light the rooms up nice and bright. We do not use the plug feature, however, it is neat that it come with an extra power source built in. This lamp has a small weight to it so it\u2019s not easy to knock over or move. Couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\u201d\u201cThis lamp looks great on the nightstand. I wanted an industrial type look. I preferred the way this one looked with the glass and I chose an amber Edison bulb for it. It really looks great.\u201d\u201cThis is so cool! My nightstand is too cluttered with other things to fit a full-sized lamp, so I got this to use as a reading light. It\u2019s nice to be able to just reach over and tap it when I\u2019m tired and want to go to sleep, and I don\u2019t have to get up to flip off a light switch. I love that I can carry it to different rooms whenever I\u2019d like, and don\u2019t have to charge it very often. It has a nice range of brightness settings, as well.\u201d\u201cThese lamps worked out great for my nightstands. I wasn\u2019t certain that they would be big enough, but the size was perfect. They also blended well with my decor. The fabric is really smooth. The lamps feel and look even better in person. So happy I got these and the quality was even better than I expected especially for this price.\u201d\u201cI bought this lamp to be a bedside table lamp that I could easily turn off while sitting in bed. It\u2019s a great little lamp, very stylish. The lamp is very bright for me, and it lights up my entire bedroom. If you\u2019re looking for a lamp to put on a table, this would be a great choice. The shade is a strong material (it doesn\u2019t seem like it would be easy to rip, hasn\u2019t ripped for me), and the cord is very sturdy. Great lamp!\u201d\u201cWe purchased this set of lamps for our bedside nightstands two years ago. We were looking for touch lamps in particular to prepare for the arrival of our baby, being that she was going to be sleeping next to our bed for the first couple of months, and we wanted something convenient.\u00a0These fit the bill. The touch is quite sensitive and I like that they have three brightness settings. The low is perfect for middle of the night diaper changes while the high is enough to light the whole room. They\u2019re still going strong after two years, we haven\u2019t had any issues with them, and haven\u2019t had to change bulbs out. It\u2019s also nice that they are sleek and stylish and go nicely with our decor, and don\u2019t take up too much room on our nightstands.\u201d\u201cThis lamp is absolutely stunning. It will work for either a child\u2019s or adult\u2019s sports-themed room. The colors are somewhat muted and it has a matte finish, which just adds to the overall beauty of it. You will not regret this purchase.\u201d\u201cI purchased this product for my 6-year-old who enjoys reading at night after story time. Instead of having to turn off her light on the other side of the room when she is finished, her mother and I thought this was a better idea. It has worked out beautifully. The product itself has a great little design with a soft gel like dome, and easily turns off and on with a slight push atop of the head.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
