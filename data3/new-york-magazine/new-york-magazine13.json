{"id": "The Best Changing Tables on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try\u00a0everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of\u2019 \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written before about the best changing pads, diaper caddies, and cribs, here we\u2019re investigating the best changing tables on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cBought this beautiful changing table for my child\u2019s nursery, and we absolutely love it! The white color matches any nursery d\u00e9cor, and it is extremely well-made and sturdy for the price point.\u00a0I love the two shelves underneath to store diapers and various creams and toys. The table was very easy to assemble, and my husband had it done in about 20 minutes.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely love this changing table. I have been using it now for four months and couldn\u2019t be any happier with my decision to buy it, after searching a zillion changing tables! It\u2019s the perfect size, and the storage underneath is great! Can\u2019t recommend enough!\u201d\u201cThis is a great changing station for a little one and is a great relief for your lower back, rather than bending over into a bassinet, crib, or bed while changing. The table has great storage underneath as well. Our child is 5 months and already at 27 inches, and is getting close to being too long to be changed in it. I would recommend this changing table for 0 to 6 months, depending on how long your child is!\u201d\u201cAs a mama expecting her ninth baby, I\u2019ve owned a few changing tables over the years. This past year, we weren\u2019t expecting to get pregnant and had given away all of our baby things right before moving across the country. That led me to this changing table, which I LOVE! For one, it\u2019s insanely cheap! It was easy to put together. It\u2019s made really well, and it looks good. If you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive changing table, you should take a chance on this one!\u201d\u201cI LOVE this Playard! We put this in our living room for our newborn to nap in during the day. The vibrating bassinet is very soothing and helps her sleep longer. I love the four shelves beneath the bassinet and changing station. When she outgrows the bassinet and changer I like the option to keep the height of the Playard higher to make lifting her in and out easier. The Playard is also very light and easy to collapse and carry.\u201d\u201cThis was lighter than I thought, but that made the entire assembly easy. The finish was UNBLEMISHED!! It is also convertible, yes. And by that I guess they mean that you simply remove the side of the crib and \u2018booyah!\u2019 toddler bed!! There is no rail or anything else to add to convert it. It has three mattress levels, and the highest one is perfect for a baby who does not sit up yet.\u201d\u201cHeavy duty, quality material, easy installation, easy use, great for commercial use, even has ADA-compliant installation instructions.\u201d\u201cI purchased this changing table for my infant\u2019s room. It was super easy to install. I love, love, love that it takes up no floor space. Super easy to fold down, and put back up after changing my baby. It even looks nice on the wall. This is a great product.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
