As always, please comment with one of your own \u2014 we\u2019re here to help.Question: I am in desperate need of your sleuthing skills.\u00a0Maya\u00a0Rudolph wears several pairs of (the same?)\u00a0clogs\u00a0throughout season one of Forever \u2014 and I need them. I also don\u2019t want to blow hundreds on some random Swedish brand without the Strat stamp of approval. Help me hunt down these wooden-soled wonders?On the Amazon show Forever, Maya Rudolph\u2019s character June leads a really boring life and an even more boring afterlife, but one glint of brightness (aside from the very nice ceramics she makes) is her penchant for really good clogs.We called Forever\u2019s costume designer Kirston Mann, who told us the blue braided clogs Rudolph wears are (as we suspected) No. 6, a favorite of artsy moms from Boerum Hill to Silver Lake. \u201cBoth Maya and I are big clog wearers, we\u2019ve been huge fans of No. 6 for many years, and in our real lives we have almost every color and every style. I\u2019ve worked with her before on The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but this was the first time we got to do dream clothes that we would want to actually wear,\u201d Mann said.We also reached out to No. 6 owner Karin Bereson for more information on the two styles that Rudolph wears in Forever, who told us that Rudolph also wears the five-inch Buckle Boot clog.\u201cShe also wears our Heidi Woven Clog on Mid Heel in navy, which is a very recent past style. We are doing it this season without the weave; it\u2019s called the Old School Clog on Mid Heel and has become one of our best sellers. We can, however, make older styles for customers upon request.\u201d \u2014Bereson This suede green pair is pretty great, too.But if you\u2019re dead set on a pair with the braided top detail, you can pick up a pair from this season, though they\u2019re wedge heels rather than ordinary clogs. Or look through a few similar styles that you don\u2019t have to wait for the No. 6 sample sale to find.For clog rookies, this pair of light-brown 2.7-inch-heel clogs is a great pair to start with \u2014 just remember that they take a few wears to break in and get used to.For a pair with braided detailing not so unlike No. 6, check out these MIA Elsa clogs.If you\u2019re really looking for comfort or have a slightly wider foot, these are a good and inexpensive bet.This two-inch heel is perfect for everyday wear with jeans or dressier occasions with dresses or skirts.For fans of higher heels, Swedish Hasbeens are well-loved and come in a broad range of colors and styles.If you\u2019re looking to go even higher, check out these caramel-colored babies from Free People.Finally, if you already own a pair of No. 6 or any of the above, you might want to try the pair we dubbed the \u201cnew status clog\u201d in bright aqua blue.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
