{"id": "The Best Coffee Tables on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve covered glass coffee tables under $200, cheap-but-expensive-looking side tables, even animal-footed end tables, here we\u2019re zeroing in on the best coffee tables on Amazon, according to the people \u2014\u00a0and all of them happen to be under $250. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cSuper\u00a0easy\u00a0to put together; good size \u2014\u00a0not too big but just enough to place a basket, remotes, coasters, etc. The round shape works perfectly for a sectional. I\u00a0love\u00a0the color of the \u2018wood\u2019 top. Would buy again, especially for the price!\u201d\u201cI received my table much sooner than expected, and I\u00a0absolutely\u00a0love\u00a0it. It\u2019s extremely easy to assemble, for those of you who may not be good at that sort of thing (myself included). It took me less than 30 minutes, and the directions are very simple \u2026 It is smaller than I expected it to be, for sure, but it actually worked to my advantage because my apartment is also small. It actually makes my small living quarters look much more spacious. The quality of the table is great, especially for the price. It looks much more expensive than the actual price tag, so I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, I\u00a0love\u00a0the table. If you\u2019re looking for something chic yet affordable, this is the product for you.\u201d\u201cAfter struggling to find furniture without particle board, we were concerned that the description of solid pine was possibly just a veneer. Nope, this\u00a0coffee\u00a0table\u00a0is all solid wood, and was very easy to assemble. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t wobble at all, and none of the fasteners are visible. We would definitely buy this brand again. Oh, and the color is very nice, not too dark.\u201d\u201cThis thing is\u00a0great. It\u2019s the most basic coffee table of all time, and I mean that in the best way. It was [cheap], it took about two minutes (no exaggeration) to screw the legs in, and it\u2019s attractive for the money. It\u2019s a\u00a0black\u00a0finish (the underside of the table isn\u2019t\u00a0black) and\u00a0looks\u00a0nice. I\u2019m a college student, and I didn\u2019t want to shell out a lot for a really nice coffee table, but wanted something to put in front of the couch. This fits the bill.\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0table\u00a0was perfect for my needs. It\u2019s a warm, dark-brown finish with muted, colored slats on the bottom shelf \u2026 The bottom shelf slats are not bright or distracting; they are warm and muted and look nice in a room with earth tones. They are also textured, not rough, and do not splinter. As a matter of fact, my dog loves to sleep on the bottom shelf, which is testament to the smooth feel of the\u00a0wood. I was on the fence about purchasing because of the colored slats, but they don\u2019t scream at you and actually add a bit of character \u2026 It\u2019s definitely worth the price. I would recommend.\u201d\u201cA beautiful addition to our living room. I love the classic lines of the table. I don\u2019t usually like glass tops, but this is just a glass inset. Very sturdy and solid wood. Installation was pretty easy. All in all, very pleased with this table!\u201d\u201cEasy to assemble, looks great, sturdy, and has a clean modern look. Works well for my son\u2019s apartment.\u201d\u201cI\u00a0love\u00a0this table. I needed a smaller coffee table with\u00a0storage\u00a0options, and this fit perfectly. The drawer is small, but the shelf underneath allows for a basket to conceal an extra throw blanket or a decorative\u00a0storage\u00a0box. The color is a little lighter than what I had in mind. It is a cherrywood color. Overall, I am very happy with it.\u201d\u201cThis is a beautiful table. It fits well in my small apartment living room and provides a good amount of extra storage. It was not too difficult to put together by myself. I had to prop the bottom shelf on something sturdy while I screwed it onto the legs, but that was my only (very minor) difficulty. It\u2019s very sturdy, and the\u00a0drawers\u00a0roll in and out very smoothly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a great product. I\u00a0love\u00a0the three block storage and the storage in the table; I am a neat freak. It\u2019s not the best quality, but it\u2019s the best quality you\u2019ll get at that price. It looks expensive. All my friends compliment me on the table. The\u00a0lift-top\u00a0is so convenient for when you are eating or painting your nails. I recommend this product to anyone who wants something that looks really nice.\u201d\u201cI bought this so I could use the storage inside to prevent my dog from eating things in my living room, like remotes, tissues. It is surprisingly good quality for [the price]. Easy to assemble and is very sturdy and easy to\u00a0lift\u00a0up and down. If you press too hard while it is\u00a0lifted\u00a0up while eating on it, it can slam down, which is probably the only downfall. But it does not scratch or show marks on the faux-marble\u00a0top\u00a0and is easy to clean. Overall, great coffee table for the price, and people can\u2019t believe I only paid $100 for it, as it looks like I got it from a more expensive furniture store.\u201d\u201cThis is a great ottoman. I hate\u00a0coffee\u00a0tables\u00a0and love storage. Perfect solution. Set up is easy, I did it in five minutes, and Ikea assembly generally makes me cry. It\u2019s adorable, great purchase, and I highly recommend.\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0coffee\u00a0table\u00a0is actually way more beautiful than I thought it would be. The top is sturdy wood, and the bottom has a nice, clean\u00a0industrial\u00a0look to it. It\u2019s larger than I imagined, but it looks like a really high-quality piece.\u201d\u201cIt is the perfect mixture of\u00a0rustic\u00a0and industrial with the reclaimed wood top and the\u00a0metal\u00a0side bars. It arrived in a large box that was very heavy. It was pretty easy to put together but definitely requires two people because one person has to hold it together while the other screws in the pieces. Assembly probably took about 20 minutes, and the most annoying part was the Styrofoam that got everywhere. I\u2019ve had it for about a month now and haven\u2019t had any issues at all, and I absolutely\u00a0love\u00a0it. I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on it, and most people are amazed at how affordable it is for such a high-quality\u00a0piece. I would definitely recommend this table!\u201d\u201cI really like this thing. The fit and finish is nice \u2026 I\u2019ve received a lot of positive comments from guests;\u00a0I love putting magazines under it. It\u2019s also super sturdy. I\u2019ve put my feet up on it occasionally, over the supported areas, which is probably not a great idea, but it\u2019s really thick glass (5/16 inches). I guess that\u2019s the one downside of the\u00a0coffee\u00a0table: You can\u2019t really put your feet up on it like other setups, but it\u2019s still dope.\u201d\u201cPerfect table for my condo living room in refurnishing! Plenty of space with the elegant three-level design and very sturdy\u00a0glass. Have put all temperature of cold to hot beverage cups and holds up well. Even put a stack of five law textbooks on the table on a daily basis and strength of table withstands it all. Great value for the product.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, this is the best coffee table I have ever owned. I will buy this table again and again forever. Because it\u2019s chrome, the bottom looks see-through and looks like it\u2019s floating on air. The white top is shiny and glossy and clean. I love this table. Looks good if you want a minimalist modern design. No more clunky wooden tables. This is the one! Very easy to put together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in love with this\u00a0table. I\u2019ve been eyeing it for the longest time and finally just gave in and bought it. So happy I did! \u2026 It\u2019s beautiful. If you\u2019ve been eyeing it like me, just give in and get it because it\u2019s so worth every penny.\u201d\u201cGreat\u00a0table for the price. It doesn\u2019t\u00a0look\u00a0cheap and is perfect if you have a sectional couch. I like it also because it is long, and if you have a bunch of people on your couch, they can all get to the table easily. I really do like the way it\u00a0looks, the legs are a really nice walnut color and the\u00a0marble-looking finish on top is very nice, too! The table is sturdy and is weighted down. It really is a\u00a0great\u00a0table, and I am glad I purchased it.\u201d\u201cI love the mid-century-modern style, and I\u2019ve been wanting to get this kind of\u00a0nesting\u00a0table to match the chairs in the living room, and I\u2019m just happy I got this set! They\u2019re beautiful as described. These tables came well-packaged, no damage, with complete parts needed. It was easy to set up, it took me about half an hour just using a screwdriver manually, with no electric drill. There was no instruction in the package, but it wasn\u2019t complicated at all to know which things go where. I have two cats that love to go on the tables to get to the window, and so far it seems sturdy; also, it\u2019s easy to clean. Great purchase, very decent price.\u201d\u201cThis thing is a tank. Don\u2019t stub your toe on it; it will win. I\u00a0love\u00a0it because of the distressed industrial look of it. I put it together myself in maybe 40 minutes. The pieces are heavy and cumbersome, but once it\u2019s together, it\u2019s solid. The casters\u00a0roll\u00a0freely in any direction, which is great when you need to vacuum. There\u2019s enough space under it that my cats can squeeze under and hide. I get the feeling this will be with me for a very long time.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
