{"id": "The Best Women\u2019s Parkas on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve covered cold-weather essentials like\u00a0infrared heaters,\u00a0men\u2019s parkas, and\u00a0women\u2019s gloves, and here we\u2019ve rounded up the best women\u2019s parkas available on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI absolutely LOVE this jacket. Initially I was a bit skeptical, but after reading other reviews I decided to make the purchase. At first I ordered a large (based on other reviewers\u2019 recommendations to buy a size up), but that was too big. (I am 5\u20193\u201d, 140 lbs., and a size 9). I returned the large and ordered a medium \u2026 fits perfectly!!! I highly recommend this jacket! I currently live in an area where the temperature reaches the single digits/below zero and so far this jacket has kept me extremely warm and comfortable. The lining is extra soft/warm, the pockets are perfect. The only slight issue I have is that the zipper at times will stick, but overall this is a perfect winter jacket! Again, I\u2019m usually skeptical, but please take my word, this jacket is definitely a good buy!\u201dEditor\u2019s Note: We discovered that this was the coat \u201cthat took over the Upper East Side\u201d. Read all about it here. \u201cI am a California gal who has never been to the East Coast. I was notified by my employer that I would be traveling to Boston to undergo training for two weeks, arriving January 3. That\u2019s right, they were sending a California gal to Boston in January. Being someone who runs cold and does not tolerate cold temperatures very well, I immediately panicked. I don\u2019t even own a pair of gloves, let alone a \u201cwinter\u201d jacket or coat. I purchased a large. When I wore my coat for the first time, it was 11 degrees and snowing. Remember, I run cold. I am 5\u20193\u201d, 125 lbs., 34DD, size 2-4. I was wearing fleece thermals, jeans, a fairly thick knit sweater, scarf, gloves, and my NEW LIGHTWEIGHT VALUKER DOWN COAT. Most importantly, I purchased this coat for WARMTH, and I was ABSOLUTELY warm! ME, WARM?! YES! I was shocked that this coat did what it said it was designed to do! This is a phenomenal price for a very stylish, lightweight coat that will keep you WARM!\u201d\u201cNot only is it fashionable, but it\u2019s super warm, too! It shields me from the rain and snow (waterproof exterior) and it helps shield from the wind better than the Columbia-brand ski jacket I was previously wearing. I\u2019m an average-sized woman and I usually opt for a large jacket, but I purchased this in medium. Even with my heaviest sweater on, this coat is the perfect fit, with room to spare. The great thing about this jacket is the zippers that run along the sides. They let out about an inch if needed for those who love to layer their clothes like I do. I also love how, when completely zipped up, the hood covers your entire neck area, leaving only your face exposed to the winter elements, and it\u2019s not tight at all, fitting gently around the head. I love it so much I\u2019m going to buy another in a different color. This winter coat is amazing!\u201d\u201cI love this coat! I\u2019ve lived in New England for nearly 15 years, and I\u2019ve been cold every winter. I decided it was high time to get a warm winter coat, and this one hasn\u2019t disappointed me. When I wear it, I feel like I\u2019m wearing a hug; it\u2019s so cozy! It fits great and it\u2019s stylish, too. I highly recommend it!\u201d\u201cI live in Wisconsin. I bought this coat prior to a trip that included visits to Chicago, Minneapolis, and Amsterdam. One coat had to handle all three places. This one was absolutely perfect! Chicago was cold, Amsterdam was cool and overcast, with rain thrown into the mix on our last day, and Minneapolis was downright frigid \u2014 meaning never above zero, and sometimes as low as 19 below. I was comfortable in all three places, and have been at home since I returned. A nice feature of this is that it has a zipper pocket on the left chest that fits my iPhone 8 Plus. This coat was definitely worth waiting for.\u201d\u201cPurchased this jacket with the intention of investing in a coat that will last a few years. So far, so good. I was a little worried as the jacket was a lot lighter than and not as puffy as I thought it would be, but having worn it to and from the bus stops here in Pittsburgh in the winter, I have not felt cold at all. Very warm coat and good length \u2014 comes just above the knee. I am 5\u20194\u201d and average build and weight, so I got a medium. It\u2019s perfect with or without a bulky sweater under it. Just enough room to move around. Great price for a well-made jacket!\u201d\u201cGreat investment! I live in Chicago where the winters can be harsh. I commute and often wait outdoors for the train to arrive. We\u2019ve had some sub-zero days, and I\u2019ve been warm without overheating. The length is perfect, it spans below the knee. The coat is stylish, fits well, and has plenty of pockets. The knitted cuffs and fleecy inner collar, along with the hood, really keep the wind out. It\u2019s similar in appearance to another down coat that\u2019s extremely popular, very expensive, and worn by a lot of people here. It\u2019s a fraction of the cost of that other design. I\u2019ve received compliments, and been asked, \u2018Where\u2019d you get that coat?\u2019 several times. I\u2019m so glad I bought it. Very happy!\u201d\u201cSUPER warm! But it\u2019s honestly a jacket you wouldn\u2019t want to get wet. Very warm, but not ideal for snow or rain. The arm-length is rather short and I would NOT recommend this product if you have bigger thighs/butt. I\u2019m tall and skinny and can\u2019t comfortably stretch my legs in this without feeling like I\u2019m going to pop out of the bottom of my coat. Overall, very nice jacket.\u201d\u201cLove this. Warm and waterproof. Wore during a bitterly cold wind in NYC recently. I wear a hat under the hood as it isn\u2019t a close fit but other than that \u2014 awesome, close-fitting, and stylish.\u201d\u201cHad no idea what to expect when ordering this coat, and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a size XL, and it fits perfectly \u2014 I am 39\u201d/33\u201d/45\u201d, 5\u20196\u201d, 175 lbs. My recent trip to rural PA put this coat to the test, as temperatures reached around 7 degrees Fahrenheit. I started to get uncomfortable below 10 degrees Fahrenheit, but this jacket kept me warm for anything above that. Like any down coat, feathers come out every once and awhile. All in all, it was a great deal for the price, and seems well-made.\u201d\u201cI recently took a trip to Iceland, where the average daytime temperature was in the low 30s to low 40s (Fahrenheit), and it was forecast to rain on and off for our whole trip with the possibility of snow. I\u2019ve lived in a mildly warm climate my entire life and have never had a need for a heavy waterproof jacket before. This jacket was perfect for my needs! It is totally waterproof and very warm. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and 125 lbs., so I normally wear a size small in tops; I ordered a small jacket and was pleased to find that it was roomy enough to wear multiple layers underneath without becoming stifling or constrictive. The pockets were easily accessible and held my phone, keys, and sunglasses with room to spare. The breast pocket looks small, but it is large enough to hold a smartphone. The inside of the jacket is some sort of faux fur which was quite soft and cozy. I especially liked that the hood has two straps on either side which can Velcro together across the front of the mouth \u2014 in bitterly cold wind this prevented the hood from being yanked off my head and protected my lips. And the jacket was very waterproof \u2014 I wore it out and about in the rain and stayed completely dry. Overall I was very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
