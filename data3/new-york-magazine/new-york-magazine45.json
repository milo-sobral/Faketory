{"id": "The Best Men\u2019s Parkas on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve covered cold-weather essentials like infrared heaters, men\u2019s winter gloves, and lotion for dry skin, and here we\u2019ve rounded up the best men\u2019s parkas available on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cThis is not a coat that you need to layer under. I wore it yesterday in 25 degrees Fahrenheit with ten-mile-an-hour winds with only an \u2018Elementex merino wool\u2019 mid-weight base layer. Prior to that, I wore this coat in 35 degrees Fahrenheit weather down near Lake Michigan where it was really windy. I wore a coat with only a T-shirt underneath and nylon pants. The coat kept me more than comfortably warm.\u201d\u201cI just got this coat, so this may be a bit early. It\u2019s 8 degrees Fahrenheit (-13 Celsius) today, and I\u2019m toasty warm. I\u2019ve inspected every stitch of this coat and it appears to be the real deal. I\u2019d say it runs a little big, so be sure to use the Canada Goose sizing chart. If you\u2019re in between sizes, get the smaller. It\u2019s actually lighter than I expected. I can\u2019t see how you could get any better quality.\u201d\u201cOn my way to Minnesota, so I felt I needed a good parka to keep me warm in those frigid temperatures. I was born and raised in Hawaii and have lived in L.A. for the past 15 years. I am not afraid of the cold; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to it. I\u2019ve purchased a bomber jacket from A.I. before and it\u2019s my go-to coat when it gets a li\u2019l chilly here. I knew I could rely on the quality, build, and comfort that would come with the parka.\u201d\u201cBought this for a trip to NYC in December to January. It holds up for warmth and good style. I am into men\u2019s style and such things, so I know to buy quality items. Considering that I typically live in warmer climes in the southwest part of the U.S., I did not feel the need to invest in higher-level parkas like N.F. and Canada Goose. This will get you through some below-zero temperatures trust me, and it looks quite good.\u201d\u201cAs of this review I have enjoyed having this coat through two Michigan winters, and I highly recommend it. I\u2019d buy it again. The coat is much warmer than it looks from the product photos, with plenty of insulation to keep you warm on extremely cold days. The hood does a great job of extending that warmth to your head as well.\u201d\u201cI needed a new winter jacket, and all I can say right off the bat is pockets, pockets, pockets. You\u2019ll find pockets in places you would never expect. If you like pockets, or if you feel you haven\u2019t had enough pockets in your life, this jacket is for you. I ordered a medium, and my previous winter coat was also a medium, and this jacket fits perfectly. It keeps me nice and toasty in this harsh Minnesota weather.\u201d\u201cSuper warm! So good for the price. The hood is a bit large. I\u2019m five-foot-five and 150 pounds. I bought a small. Still a little big, but not by much. Totally worth it. My new standard winter coat.\u201d\u201cIt has been a few years since I purchased snow gear, but I knew you cannot go wrong with Burton. As the season comes to an end, I can say this is one of the best jackets I have owned. I never felt wet after a long day riding and do not remember a time I actually felt cold when wearing it. Even during the periodic blizzards while riding, I never wore more than one layer under the jacket. I would highly recommend.\u201d\u201cBought this for my tall husband, so am always looking to find things in a tall size. He really liked this! Bought a size up just to have a little extra room for wearing a sweater, etc. Nice and warm, casual winter coat. He said it was very comfortable!\u201d\u201cGreat parka! Fits well, definitely windproof. Not too thick, not too thin.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m five-foot-nine 145 pounds, slim. It fit nicely, not baggy, tight around the shoulder area. The hood is detachable. Must\u2019ve been a really awesome coat because someone stole it from me at the bar I went to within the first six hours of me owning it \u2026 Still got the hood though.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
