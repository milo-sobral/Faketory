It gave my lashes the volume and subtle lift I desired, without flaking or running. But then in May, Glossier launched Lash Slick, its new mascara. Lash Slick quickly won my heart: I could wear it day to night without a trace of smudging, and it made my lashes look subtly lengthened and thickened. But still, I found myself going back and forth between the two. Both mascaras made my lashes look bigger, my eyes look brighter, and neither gave me panda eyes.
