{"id": "The Beauty Advent Calendars to Buy Before They Sell Out, According to a Trend Forecaster", "paragraph": "Editor\u2019s note: Two beauty advent calendars from best-selling brands Jo Malone and Kiehl\u2019s are also now available, so we\u2019ve added those below. The appeal of a giant makeup or skin-care advent calendar as a holiday gift\u00a0\u2014 once you stomach the steep price point \u2014 is twofold: There\u2019s a little something for everyone, even if you don\u2019t know the recipient\u2019s taste, and it\u2019s almost always a bargain once you account for the retail price of every item individually. Since these calendars are already hitting the shelves, we consulted a trend forecaster about the best ones to buy right now (eagle-eyed observers may note the exception of the collectible M.A.C calendar, which is sadly only available in the U.K. for now), plus ones that give you much more than you pay for.A curated assortment from a retailer with good taste is one of the savviest ways to shop for these sets. \u201cSome of the beauty of these is knowing and trusting a particular brand, like Space NK,\u201d says Jenni Middleton, the head of beauty at trend-forecasting agency WGSN (with over 15 years of experience in the health, retail, and beauty industries). \u201cYou trust that whatever you\u2019re going to get from them is going to surprise and delight you.\u201d This year, that means 25 cult favorites like Sunday Riley\u2019s juno oil, Ouai\u2019s wave spray, Tata Harper\u2019s regenerating cleanser, and others \u2014 at a fraction of their usual price.\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about a beauty house that has a reputation for pulling together great brands, it\u2019s Look Fantastic,\u201d says Middleton. It doesn\u2019t preview which brands are included in the set until you open it, but online spoilers reveal that this year we\u2019ll see a Glamglow mask, First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream, and Caudalie serum, among others \u2014 all things that are ideal for dry, winter skin.Net-a-Porter is another name that\u2019s known for its taste in beauty, with one added bonus being that its products are often uniquely culty, says Middleton, and not something you\u2019d find at your average beauty counter. This year\u2019s set, for example, clocking in at just over $200, includes some of our most beloved (and pricey) hair and beauty brands at the Strategist, from R+Co and Leonor Greyl to Sachajuan and Sunday Riley \u2014 so this is one we\u2019d recommend scooping up before it sells out.At a lower price point, for the person who self-describes as a Sephora addict, Middleton calls this affordable Once Upon a Castle advent calendar a \u201cbeauty smorgasbord\u201d with lots of variety. Note that these are exclusively makeup minis from Sephora\u2019s in-house collection, with highlights that include its cream lip stain (a favorite of the Cut\u2019s Kathleen Hou) and a blueberry bodywash.Editor\u2019s Note: This Sephora calendar has already sold out, but here\u2019s another that\u2019s still on sale.For a varied mix of high-low beauty, Middleton says QVC\u2019s advent calendar is another that\u2019s reliably good. \u201cQVC is a very well trusted curator of beauty products. And it has expertise in selecting from the premium range and the mass-consumer range. It\u2019s got a very fine heritage of beauty.\u201d This one includes skin-care favorites from Dr. Jart and Kate Somerville, plus makeup finds like a Bare Minerals mascara and It Cosmetics brow gel.Beyond a curated potpourri of minis from bigger retailers, the beauty-obsessed person might want something more specific to their high-end tastes. The selection from Diptyque \u2014 one of the cultiest luxury brands \u2014 never fails to disappoint, and this year\u2019s advent calendar contains 15 mini-candles, plus perfumes and oils, for $425 (which, when you consider the cost per item, is still a steal). Middleton says this one hits a sweet spot of being both festive, Christmassy, and appropriately lavish: \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to have candles at Christmas? Anything that\u2019s super indulgent, with bath and body and luxury, from relaxing candles to relaxing fragrances, or body souffl\u00e9s and body butters, people will want to spend more money on those, especially if they think they\u2019re getting more value out of them.\u201dEditor\u2019s Note: As predicted, this set is already sold out, but you can still buy a festive trio of bath and body products from Diptyque or some sets of candles: three, five, or ten.And though we previously reported that this Jo Malone advent calendar was only available in the U.K., the U.S. version just dropped, and as one of the most highly anticipated beauty calendars every year, it\u2019s already sold out at Saks. It\u2019s sort of the ultimate gift set of 24 perfumes, oils, and candles, if you\u2019re a fiend for your bath and fragrance stuff, so we\u2019d suggest moving on this quickly before it sells out and starts making the rounds on eBay.Middleton likes this beauty set from L\u2019Occitane, too, which tends to be a hit with moms (and people who hoard their hand creams). And when you consider that a single hand cream typically runs for $12 a pop, the fact that you\u2019re getting a pocket-size medley of goodies \u2014 from soaps to creams \u2014 makes this a really nice investment set for the holidays.Another consistent best seller is Rituals\u2019 advent calendar, which Middleton attributes to the fact that \u201cRituals has raving fans and such a luxury following.\u201d And it\u2019s got utility beyond your own personal use, she adds: \u201cEveryone\u2019s hosting guests for Christmas, or they\u2019re traveling themselves, so those travel-size shower gels and hand soaps can be useful during that time of year.\u201dFor sheer presentation alone (look at all this glitter) plus the hyperpopularity and priciness of Charlotte Tilbury products, we\u2019d also suggest checking out her advent calendar of 12 makeup and skin-care staples, from her iconic Pillowtalk lipstick to her deeply rich magic cream.Don\u2019t miss out on this whopping 24-count skin-care advent calendar from Kiehl\u2019s, either. It\u2019s filled with enough masks, serums, cleansers, and moisturizer minis to last you for months \u2014 so at $70, it\u2019s a steal.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
