{"id": "The Best Christmas Onesies on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try\u00a0everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve covered the best\u00a0artificial Christmas trees,\u00a0Christmas tree toppers,\u00a0Christmas lights, Christmas wreaths, and Christmas pajamas, and here we\u2019re zeroing in on the best Christmas onesies on Amazon, according to the people. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cAlright, where do I start? This thing rocks. I love Christmas, I love comfort, I love a drop-seat for bathroom convenience. At first my boyfriend made fun of me for purchasing this, but after seeing me traipsing around the house practically oozing Christmas magic, I know he\u2019s probably secretly jealous. This onesie has everything: feeties, dropseat, hood with drawstrings, and a fashionable wintery print. Honestly, what more could you ask for? P.S. As others have mentioned, it\u2019s big, but I mean, who needs a form-fitting jumpsuit when you\u2019re busy shoveling Christmas cookies down your gullet?\u201d\u201cI have lived in this thing for days. I don\u2019t know why I own everyday clothes.\u201d\u201cPERFECT GIFT FOR\u00a0CHRISTMAS!! Everyone loved it. The material is THICK and FLUFFY! Super cozy! Buying one for myself and everyone else now! Def worth the money!\u201d\u201cFirst, the material is incredibly soft, and incredibly warm. I become a hug magnet when I am wearing this. The grips on the feet are great for avoiding slippage, and I didn\u2019t know that the feet can unzip from the rest of the outfit when I bought it. Very cool. I figured this would be an item I would use for this one party, and then put away \u2026 I have worn it at one other after party, and have worn it around the house several times. I plan on buying one for the wife and more for myself in different colors.\u201d\u201cMy husband LOVES his onesie! When he gets chilled, he puts it on, and snoozes in his chair, all comfy! The size is perfect on him, a tad larger, which is good for giving some room to move. It washes well too, staying nice and soft!\u201d\u201cLOVE LOVE LOVE this! Best\u00a0Christmas\u00a0gift this year \u2014 warm, soft, and comfy. No blankets needed! I\u2019m cold-natured so it is perfect for me!\u201d\u201cBought this for my wife and she loves it. It\u2019s cold here in the winter and this is great for lounging on cold nights. Fits her great and she looks adorable in it!\u201d\u201cSuper cute and form fitting!! Wore to Santa Con and I was super warm while all the other girls were in super tiny outfits in the freezing cold. Holy hell they are brave lol definitely wearing this every year!\u201d\u201cSeriously my favorite onesie right now!! Planning to wear it even after the holidays because it\u2019s the perfect size and the perfect thickness \u2014 not too hot not too cold! I plan on getting another onesie from this seller soon.\u201d\u201cMy wife loves them especially at the snowmobile cabin.\u201d\u201cAs soon as I put on this onesie, I fell in love. It\u2019s soft, warm without being too hot, and ADORABLE. I got the penguin one. Because I am petite, the legs and arms are too long but that just makes me love it more. A snuggly, oversize, adorable onesie. At a great price! What more could you ask for? Update: IT HAS POCKETS!!\u201d\u201cThese are the best PJs I\u2019ve ever bought. The organic cotton is perfect. The sizing is perfect. If you normally wear large, get large. They have the cutest square tags on the back of the bottoms and top. This will not be my last pair. I got red and white stripes. They would have been so cute for\u00a0Christmas.\u201d\u201cSo cute! I think these are made for boys but I got them for my daughter to wear in December and she loved them. The colors are bright and they washed up well. She wore them multiple times all month long and they were washed after every use and are still soft and bright. She actually still wears them now, three months later! I am happy that the red pair did not bleed onto the white Santa beard. Would definitely buy again. True to size.\u201d\u201cVery happy with these pajamas. They were a little large for their size, but I think that\u2019s okay for footie pajamas. It was fun to have a great design that worked for my son and daughter. They loved having matching pajamas for Christmas!\u201d\u201cSoooo cute for Christmas morning and long enough to wear next year too. My kids hate stuff on their feet so these were perfect. Fabric is nice and thick yet soft.\u201d\u201cIf David Bowie comes back as the Goblin King to take my kid and make me traverse the Labyrinth \u2026 she has got her outfit. And it fits great. Now all I need is a flouncy short and \u201980s mom jeans\u2026\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
