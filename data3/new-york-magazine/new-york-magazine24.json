{"id": "Everything You Need to Start Playing Bridge (Minus Friends)", "paragraph": "I think I finally understand why old people love bridge. It takes forever to learn \u2014 like forever \u2014 so depending on when you start your bridge-playing journey, you\u2019ll still be perfecting your game up until the very end. This is what I learned when a few friends and I got together and started a bridge group dedicated to learning the game as long as it took us. And it might take forever at the rate we\u2019re going, but there is something about the complicated trick-taking card game that sucks you in, no matter the difficulty.Whenever I\u2019m bad at something and would like to get better, I immediately look to the internet in an attempt to find ways to expedite that process. Is there a book I can read? An app I can download? Some cube that reminds me what trump is? (That\u2019s for another way-less-difficult card game called euchre, and thanks to a pal, I already have one.) I\u2019ve found that while there\u2019s nothing that\u2019ll make you better at bridge other than regular games with your bridge pals, there are a few things that can help you along the way. Here\u2019s a starter kit.You will obviously need a table, but any folding, four-sided one with just enough room for one person on each side (it\u2019s too easy to peek with a round table) will work. The folding bit is crucial \u2014 you\u2019ll want to store it away once you\u2019re done.The No. 1 thing you\u2019ll need is a good pack of playing cards. While any set will technically do (yes, even the novelty cards you got at your cousin\u2019s bat mitzvah), there definitely are brands of playing cards that are just more comfortable to play with. Luckily, they\u2019re cheap. I like the look of Copag, but you can go with a standard bridge-size deck of Bicycles, too.In bridge, you have to hold a lot of cards in your hand at once. That can be annoying, especially if you\u2019re prone to \u201closing\u201d a card or two, or getting them stuck behind each other. Here are nifty cardholders that can help you keep thinkings organized, and also reduce stress on your paws. (They\u2019re also great for little kids.)My bridge friends and I swear by our personal \u201ccheat sheets\u201d when playing. These are all allowed, by the way, and unless you have an incredible memory, you\u2019ll want access to your own.And when you get to the point that you actually want to keep score, (ooh, you\u2019re good, aren\u2019t you?), there\u2019s a pad that claims it can help you do that. I wouldn\u2019t know anything about it because I\u2019m still working on perfecting my bidding. I\u2019ll get there.Speaking of bidding, these are boxes that the \u201cpros\u201d use to help keep track of the bid as it goes around the table. You\u2019ll never have to ask to review the bid again.If you\u2019re just learning the game, almost everyone I\u2019ve asked recommends Audrey Grant\u2019s Bridge Basics as a place to start. But here\u2019s a tip from me: Ignore everything involving scoring until you\u2019re at least 50 games or so in. It\u2019s too confusing when you\u2019re just learning the mechanics.And if you\u2019re slightly more advanced, Grant\u2019s Bridge at a Glance is a great resource book to keep by your side.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
