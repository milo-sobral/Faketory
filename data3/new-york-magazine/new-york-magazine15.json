{"id": "The Best Gifts for 9-Year-Olds, According to a Child Psychologist", "paragraph": "What to make of a 9-year-old, who\u2019s not yet a pre-teen but definitely not a toddler? \u201cAt the age of 9, children begin to form real social relationships and friendships,\u201d says Dr. George Sachs,\u00a0a clinical child psychologist who specializes in ADD and ADHD treatment on the Upper West Side in Manhattan. \u201cMany children even begin to have best friends and start to have sleepovers with peers.\u201d And as they continue their cognitive development, fourth graders \u201care able to focus better for longer periods of time and can pursue specific interests,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re able to learn in a holistic way and not just learn that things are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong.\u2019\u201d Below are 13 books, toys, games, and gifts for fourth graders that Sachs helped us pick out. We\u2019ve also got gift guides for kids of all ages, including 1-year-olds, 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and 10-year-olds.And if you\u2019re looking for holiday toys, don\u2019t miss the\u00a0top kid\u2019s toys to buy before they sell out\u00a0\u2014 we talked to experts to find 2018\u2019s hottest toys.By age 9, children can read fiction and nonfiction and often begin to read independently: \u201cThey have a better grasp of grammar, contain higher vocabulary, and can formulate longer sentences,\u201d says Sachs. Even though these best-selling books are about a middle-schooler named Greg, \u201cthis series is really attune to the life of a fourth grader. These books are excellent because there\u2019s a sense of mastery when a child reads the set and then puts put them on their shelf. There\u2019s a sense of accomplishment.\u201d Parents can also use the books as an opportunity to talk to their kids about potentially troubling social interactions: \u201cIf your child has conflicts with his or her friends, now is the time to be involved so they can learn the right ways to navigate social interactions with peers.\u201dRick Riordan\u2019s New York Times best-selling fantasy-adventure series Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a favorite among kids in middle grade, according to Sachs. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s a character with ADHD,\u201d he says. Based on Greek mythology, the five-book set follows the adventures of Percy, a modern-day 12-year-old demigod and son of Poseidon who goes head to head with a slew of gods and monsters. The series can also provide an opening into talking about puberty: \u201cSpeak with your children about changes they may experience and help them feel normal and comfortable regarding the transitions.\u201dWinner of the Newbery Medal and the National Book Award, Louis Sachar\u2019s 1998 novel Holes about the misadventures of teenage boy Stanley Yelnats is another excellent choice for 9-year-olds, says Sachs. While some of the themes in the book may be a little advanced for a fourth grader (forced labor, justice, fate, and history, to name a few), they can help kids better understand the world around them. Parents can take this opportunity to provide their children with age-appropriate information about the world. \u201cIf your children ask questions about a news story or something they saw earlier in the day, answer honestly but in a framework they can understand,\u201d says Sachs. \u201cTogether with your child, you can discuss the feelings that may arise and ways to be involved to help the world.\u201d After reading the book, have a family movie night by watching the film version starring Shia LaBoeuf, John Voight, and Sigourney Weaver.\u201cJudy Blume books are always classic and will always hold up,\u201d says Sachs. This set includes all five books in the Fudge series, which follows the frustrations of 9-year-old 4th grader Peter Hatcher as he deals with his mischievous younger brother Fudge.\u201cParticularly with kids who don\u2019t like to read, I actually recommend graphic novels or anime,\u201d says Sachs, \u201cbecause it\u2019s getting them reading, which is the most important part.\u201d City and non-city kids alike will appreciate the adventures of Pablo, the new kid in school who gets separated from his class during a field trip to the Empire State building.As kids continue to build their social lives, games are a great way to encourage friendly competition and group play. This classic card game of matching is always a winner, according to Sachs.\u201cOne game that I just played with some kids that I was really surprised at how it held up was Sorry!,\u201d says Sachs. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very simple game that kids can get right away and I recommend that.\u201dAs Sachs noted, \u201cthe classics really nailed it,\u201d and Jenga is no exception.Apples to Apples is another great game for 9-year-olds, says Sachs.\u201cThis is the age, where, anything that has to do with slime is huge with girls,\u201d says Sachs. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but girls are totally into slime: making slime, talking about slime. If you go on YouTube, you\u2019ll see how many girls at this age are making videos about slime.\u201dLego is a perennial favorite across all age groups: \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with Legos,\u201d says Sachs. And academically speaking, kids at this age are beginning to do more complex math problem-solving like multiplication and division and, according to Sachs. To get them thinking out of the box, try this five-in-one robot building set that teaches the basics of coding.By this age, most kids have already learned to bike and scooter with some skill. To take their coordination and independence to the next level, Sachs recommends trying skateboarding.Sachs also suggests rollerblading as another more advanced sport that 9-year-olds can attempt \u2014 albeit with lessons.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
