{"id": "The 11 Men\u2019s Gifts to Buy Before They Sell Out, According to a Trend Forecaster", "paragraph": "We realize that shopping for holiday gifts before Halloween probably seems crazy. But if you\u2019re looking to get something really good \u2014 something that might just sell out before the Black Friday/Cyber Monday stampede \u2014 getting started right now is our best advice.To help you find the best gifts for the man in your life (or yourself), we spoke with Brian Trunzo, senior menswear editor at trend-forecasting agency WGSN, about the men\u2019s gifts to buy right now before they\u2019re gone. Be sure to check our guide to the soon-to-sell-out holiday tech gifts, too, as many of those would be good for men. And because this stuff is bound to sell out lightning quick, we\u2019ll be updating our list as the season goes on.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about limited-run products and collaborations. First on that list is Ralph Lauren\u2019s recently announced collaboration with British skate brand Palace. This collaboration checks off all the boxes: surprising, intriguing, and guaranteed to sell out in seconds.\u201d In the meantime, anything from Palace is also bound to sell out fast. Trunzo recommends \u201csomething fleece or Thinsulate, as that\u2019s trending pretty hard right now in the market generally.\u201d\u201cThe great prep revival is continuing to take hold of men\u2019s fashion, and in line with last year\u2019s picks, the rugby returns as a must-have item. This time, it\u2019s a little more streetwear-inspired. Slightly oversize, patched together, and in bold colors. This year\u2019s version will appeal to the preppiest and most hypebeast-y of anyone\u2019s friends and family. Rowing Blazers has a wide selection of heritage-inspired rugbies, and its limited collaboration with downtown skate-inspired men\u2019s brand Noah is something truly special.\u201dFor another rugby shirt in the patched-together style that Trunzo mentioned, we like this updated prep classic from Guess \u2014 a prep-heavy brand that came to fame in the \u201990s, checking two major trend boxes.\u201cPretty much any colorway of the Nike React Element 87 will be covetable this season. It appears to have been a little unexpected for Nike (the success of the React series), as much of its marketing attention in early 2018 was focused on the Air Max 270 \u2014 but from the market, it appears that the React is the true winner.\u201dThe Air Max 270s are still a hot sneaker this season, not to mention significantly more wallet-friendly.\u201cL.L. Bean\u2019s 10\u201d Shearling-Lined Boot sells out each and every holiday season. Cozy and truly waterproof, this is a must-have each and every holiday season \u2014 just a slam-dunk gift.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the shearling-lined boots though. Bean Boots of every shape and size sell out year after year, so any pair is guaranteed to make men happy. And if your guy\u2019s feet run too hot for shearling, or you\u2019re just looking for a pair of duck boots that\u2019ll work in more temperate climates, go for these.\u201cFor a little bit more style, I\u2019d look to Salomon\u2019s X style if you\u2019re looking for something sleek and lightweight \u2014 a true performance boot.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: These are Ralph Lauren\u2019s go-to footwear.]Speaking of brand collaborations, American heritage brand Eastpak made a special limited collection of bags for J.Crew. This gunmetal-gray backpack is a riff on its most iconic design and has plenty of room for a laptop.\u201cWhen it comes to tech, Amazon continues to build on its fleet of Alexa-powered objects. Its newest item, the Echo Show, is already sold out through November 5. If you can get your hands on the next batch, you\u2019re destined to make someone close to you a very happy person this holiday season.\u201d\u201cSony took a page from the Nintendo playbook and is releasing a PlayStation Classic. Much like the Nintendo Mini, the PlayStation Classic is a miniature version of the original mid-\u201990s model. Preloaded with 20 classic hits, this little item is jam-packed with nostalgia and hours of playability.\u201d The PlayStation Classic is set to be released on December 3, but it\u2019s available for preorder now.
