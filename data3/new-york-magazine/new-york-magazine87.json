{"id": "What Are the Best Wool Slippers to Give?", "paragraph": "Where can you find the nicest scarf? Who makes the best cashmere sweater? Every year around this time \u2014 like holiday classics on the radio \u2014 certain gifts become popular all over again. To determine the very best versions of those things, we\u2019re talking to experts, adding our own opinions, and even testing products ourselves to find the greatest gift (plus several runners-up).With the holidays falling in the middle of winter, warm slippers will always be an appreciated gift. Even if they\u2019re not the main attraction, gifting a cozy pair of slippers as a bonus present can be one of the more immediate pleasures on a December morning. \u201cWool slippers provide warmth, comfort, and breathability,\u201d says Dyansa Calderon, lead buyer at Zappos. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to find quality, boiled wool slippers and ensure they\u2019re not itchy or scratchy to avoid any chafing when you walk,\u201d says Calderon.We asked Calderon for her suggestions of the best slippers, consulted past guides we\u2019ve done for worthy competitors, and then tested a bunch of these tried-and-true pairs to find the ultimate wool slipper. While each pair offered a little something unique, there was definitely a clear winner.Let\u2019s start with work we\u2019ve done before. When writer Lauren Levy tested wool slippers last year, she found that Glerups\u2019 open-heeled slippers came out on top. To see how they compare to a new batch of contenders, I requested a pair to try around the house. They really do deserve their reputation as the best slippers \u2014 they were hands down my absolute favorite. Designed in northern Denmark, they\u2019re comfortable for walking around and the wool feels warm, soft, and not at all itchy. They hug your foot and mold to your shape the more you wear them. The only notable downside to the style we tried out last year was the thin, flexible calfskin sole that wasn\u2019t fit for wet sidewalks or streets. This new version, however, has a rubber sole that offers more grip and protection for heading out.\u201cWe see new brands pop up with one or two styles for slipper season in the fall, but it\u2019s hard to compete with the tried-and-true classics,\u201d says Calderon. One of the heritage brands she likes is Giesswein, an Austrian company that\u2019s been around for over 50 years, and she says their basic Veitsch style has long been a bestseller. They\u2019re also her personal favorite because of their \u201cwider versatility thanks to [the] more prominent sole. With the added protection, you can bop around the house, water the lawn, and step out to run errands,\u201d she says. Giesswein\u2019s shoes are known for offering generous arch support, so I called in a pair to test out. The arch is extremely high- profile \u2014 which could be fine if you happen to know your gift recipient likes an exaggerated arch \u2014 but for me this felt like having a rock under my foot. The wool is very soft while not being itchy, and the thick sole is durable enough for venturing outdoors \u2014 before retreating back to the couch.Like Giesswein, the German-based Haflinger is a five-decade-old company inspired by alpine adventurers. Calderon explains that both brands also started as personal passion projects that families have continued over the years. Now, Haflinger is actually the largest manufacturer of boiled wool in Germany. She says they stand out because of the felt liner that touches the foot can be more comfortable on the skin than wool. They\u2019re also among the best-reviewed slippers on Amazon. Since these came highly recommended from Calderon, and were finalists in last year\u2019s story, I had to try them out. They are seriously soft and cozy, and will keep your feet warm all winter. Unfortunately, these do have one significant drawback that keeps them from being a universal favorite \u2014 the raised seam on the top of the slipper itches your foot and can get irritating if you\u2019re wearing these barefoot. This very same seam held these back in last year\u2019s testing, too. Not the worst choice, though, if you bundle them with a pair of wool socks.These pared-down slip-ons look like something you\u2019d find in an upscale Tokyo hotel or spa. So it makes sense that their design is inspired by the Japanese aesthetics principle of artful simplicity, wabi-sabi. They\u2019ve been a staple in Camper\u2019s lineup since 2000. Calderon says they\u2019re similar to the Haflingers but do offer a cleaner look and an alternative to the top seam. \u201cBoth have a thin cushion offering meant for easy on and off, [and] the toe box on both slippers is generous in size,\u201d she says.\u201d While some of the other slippers have a textured wool knit, these feel smoother, with less potential for itchiness. They do have a weather-ready rubber sole, but the completely flat arch might make these uncomfortable for more than padding from room to room.One of the newest entries in the wool slipper field, this pair comes from outdoor retailer Backcountry\u2019s in-house line. I wanted to give the newcomer a shot, plus these are more affordable than any other pair on the list. Despite their lack of European heritage, they\u2019re worthy contenders with the cushiest sole of any others we tried \u2014 it seriously feels like you\u2019re walking on memory foam. Best for indoor use, they\u2019re easy to slip on and off as you move around the house.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
