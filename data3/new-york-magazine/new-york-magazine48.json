{"id": "The Best Area Rugs on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve covered the \u201cCasper of vintage rugs,\u201d surveyed designers for the best area rugs under $500, and talked about the best coffee tables to place upon them, here we\u2019re singling out the best budget area rugs for under $200, as reviewed on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cLove, love, LOVE these rugs!!! I have two 45 lb. dogs who love to do zoomies and slide across my tile floors. Rugs usually don\u2019t stand a chance, even with rug tape! These grass rugs are THICK! Super well made! Perfect seams, perfect 90 degree corners! They aren\u2019t plush to walk on, but, Hello, they\u2019re made of natural fibers! Very durable! I\u2019ve had these for a couple of months now and could not be more pleased with my purchase!!!\u201d\u201cThis rug is amazing! I wanted one to put under my dining room table. With four grandchildren, I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money in case of a dropped plate of spaghetti. In the months that we have had it, we have hosted several dinner parties, and the rug has held up beautifully. The variegated colors tie all the different woods in our dining room together.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely beautiful. Of course, I expected it to shed a bit. No worries. Vacuum it well a few times and the shedding will get better. After a few weeks of sail vacuuming, it will remain nicely groomed and shed no longer. For the price, the quality cannot be beat. Perfect for my beach cabin. I especially like the raised texture of the ivory accents. I\u2019m getting another when it\u2019s time to swap out the rug in my main house.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of this rug. It is so thick and plush, and absolutely beautiful! We have an increasingly mobile baby and needed something soft and cushy for him to play on. After searching every store imaginable, we took the plunge and ordered this one \u2014 even through I was so nervous ordering a rug I\u2019d never seen in person. But I couldn\u2019t be happier with this rug! We have the 9 x 12\u2019, for reference.\u201d\u201cI have bought shag rugs for triple the price that were not as nice as this one. Nice, thick, high shag. Color slightly darker than in the photos, but completely acceptable. It took a day or two to \u2018uncurl\u2019 \u2014 with weights on the corners \u2014 but that is to be expected, and the rug is just gorgeous and luxuriously soft.\u201d\u201cI never knew it was possible to actually look forward to sitting on/laying on/walking on a new rug, but this one has made me a believer! Its high pile and dense shag more than deliver! To my surprise, it made our tiny living room look huge and it completely brightened up our space. It vacuums easily and the one spill we\u2019ve had wiped up really easily. We\u2019ve had it in our home for one month and I genuinely could not be happier with our purchase. Amazon\u2019s price for the same exact product beat those of no less than five other sites.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy with this rug! I love sheepskin rugs but didn\u2019t want to purchase a real one because the thought of it made me sad. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to find a faux version that looked real and would be just as soft, but I did! I\u2019ve had this rug for several weeks now and it has gotten even better with use. I even spilled a few things on it and I spot cleaned it very easily. Easy to vacuum as well. It\u2019s incredibly soft and I love the way it looks.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever written an Amazon review before, but holy cow \u2014 this one deserves it! I have six dogs. Let me just tell you. I don\u2019t know what kind of genie magic they placed over this bad boy before shipping out, but this thing WILL NOT STAIN. I honestly don\u2019t know how that\u2019s even possible considering it\u2019s an off-white color, but good lord, am I happy!\u201d\u201cWe bought these thinking they could be \u2018disposables.\u2019 If the dogs did what dogs do (no pun intended), we thought it would not be a problem to replace them. Well, they look so great we have kept the animals off them. They blend perfectly with the new hardwood flooring. They are the best surprise we\u2019ve had ordering sight unseen from Amazon. We love \u2018em. They look and feel every bit as good as the genuine Persian we have in another room.\u201d\u201cSo far, I have three of these rugs, and I just ordered a fourth one. I have two green and one red, with another red on the way. You might guess that I love this rug. The colors are not cheesy at all. They are great for mud rugs near a door or in a heavily trafficked area. They match well with my real Persians. I\u2019ve had no problems cleaning them with a vacuum. Did I mention they don\u2019t skid? And the price is right.\u201d\u201cI was going through a bad breakup and decided that, instead of being morose, I would add more color to my life. I bought this rug to replace the one she took. When she came back to pick up her last remaining things, she commented on it sadly: \u2018You seem to be doing well \u2026\u2019 I wasn\u2019t, but I did find something beautiful to appreciate.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
