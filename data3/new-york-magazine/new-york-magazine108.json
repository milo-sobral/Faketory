We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          My gratitude journal has seen one recurring line-entry recently: \u201cI\u2019m thankful for a warm bed.\u201d That\u2019s partially due to the colder weather, but I\u2019d also credit the comforter I\u2019ve been testing for the past week or so from Buffy \u2014 one of this year\u2019s rising stars in cozy bedding \u2014 for my reluctance to get out of bed.The duvet-in a-box startup launched last December as an environmentally friendly bedding disruptor. Instead of the industry-standard cotton and down  which consumes thousands of gallons of water and live-plucks hundreds of thousands of birds per year, respectively \u2014 you\u2019ll find a biodegradable lyocell shell sourced from eucalyptus (which has a smaller footprint overall compared to fiber materials like cotton) and interior filling sourced from 100 percent recycled plastic bottles. Buffy also designed their comforter to be softer than cotton and more breathable.You may have already seen it pop up on Instagram, because Buffy\u2019s marketing was made to be shareable. I think of it as Ban.do for bedding: Buffy\u2019s photo campaigns consist of crisp white comforters set against pastel backgrounds \u2014 give or take a beaming millennial \u2014\u00a0and unboxing the thing involves stumbling upon a soothing mint green interior with lots of googly-eyed illustrations, a pastel pink manual with a winky face on it, plus a lavender-scented eye mask that reads \u201cresting Buffy face.\u201dThe name \u201cBuffy\u201d wasn\u2019t inspired by a certain vampire slayer \u2014 I asked \u2014 but because it rhymes with the word \u201cfluffy.\u201d The goal of creating a fluffy comforter was achieved by an unusual method of crafting fine-spun materials from plastic: Using a proprietary process (founder and CEO Leo Wang comes from a family with over 50 years of experience in bedding), Buffy transforms recycled PET bottles into fluffy fibers that the brand describes as \u201cfiner than an eyelash and silky soft in texture.\u201d\u00a0And the finished product certainly lives up to these cloud-like comparisons.It\u2019s tremendously soft, light, and cool to the touch right out of the box, and sleeping beneath it, you feel nestled under an airy but cozy canopy. Maybe it\u2019s because I knew the thing was full of spun fibers, but the Buffy really does feel like sleeping under a pile of cotton candy. On the heat spectrum, it falls in the middle between the heavier down comforters and the thinner summer duvets I\u2019ve slept under. But I do think it falls short of its temperature-regulating promises: if you tend to burn up at night, anything more than a T-shirt and shorts could be overkill (a few nights ago I woke up schvitzing in a full pajama set). I\u2019ve skirted the issue by slipping it into a cooling duvet cover, though \u2014 this silky bamboo one from Loomstead, which has a delightfully silky texture \u2014 and I\u2019d suggest you do the same.I also like that the comforter is non-lumpy, not liable to pill, and whisper-quiet when you move so it doesn\u2019t rustle you awake. And when you factor in the fact that you\u2019re sleeping under something sourced from recycled goods, rather than creating more waste, you\u2019ll sleep better, too.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
