{"id": "The Best Love Seats on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve covered the best flat-pack sofas, sofas under $1,000, and sleeper sofas, here we\u2019re zeroing in on the best love seats, as reviewed on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI love this sofa! It\u2019s plush and very comfortable. I have my blanket on top of it to protect from dog fur, but the fur does come off easily with sticky roller because the material is smooth. I would buy again, and assembly was very easy. By the way, it\u2019s a beautiful sofa in person and does not look cheap.\u201d\u201cThis futon was a wonderful purchase. It came in perfect shape, we screwed on the legs, and it was done. We don\u2019t sleep on it every day, as it\u2019s our extra bed, tucked in the dining room. But it\u2019s fine to sit on \u2014\u00a0super, super soft to the touch but firm. The legs are bland, but that\u2019s not bothering me now. The leather made me fall in love with white leather. I really love it.\u201d\u201cThese are the best couches ever made. They\u2019re so comfortable and soft; the fabric is everything. I love that they recline so much. You are almost parallel to the ground when fully reclined. They were packaged very thoroughly. If they retain functionality and last through time I will keep these for the rest of my life. Everything you\u2019d want in a comfortable couch.\u201d\u201cI love my new sofa. It says it\u2019s a love seat, but it\u2019s really more like a small sofa. It provides firm support, which is my preference \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t like furniture I sink into. It\u2019s just beautiful, both the lines and the color, and was so easy to put the legs on and just go. No real setup.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely love this piece. Comfortable, modern, perfect size for our family room \u2018nook,\u2019 and the color and design are true to this picture. Looks fabulous, and several visitors have commented on how much they like it.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
