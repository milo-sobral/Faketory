{"id": "The Fancy Solid Perfume That Will Never Shatter or Spill in My Purse", "paragraph": "I recently purchased my first investment \u201cevening bag\u201d in what I\u2019ll call Barbie pink. (I try not to carry my Artforum tote all the time.) Buying the purse meant\u00a0downsizing the toiletries, a preflight and pre-party ritual we\u2019re all familiar with. Mini-toothpaste, contact solution, and roll-on deodorant made the cut. But I avoid anything that can crumble or break, ever since I shattered a tiny, potent glass bottle of R\u00e9gime des Fleurs fragrance in a bag.Perfume is kind of a weird item to bring out of the house, I know. But so few perfumes boast more than a four-hour wear period. It was my friend Susie \u2014 the kind of person who\u2019s never without an impeccable gel evil-eye manicure \u2014 who solved my portable-perfume problem when she gave me a Le Labo solid perfume for my birthday last year. Solid perfume, turns out, is just perfumed wax. The texture of Egyptian Magic, this viscous, yellowish substance is made from a healthy combination of oils: almond, coconut, and soybean. Massaging a pea-size amount of it onto your wrists is as innocuous as quickly applying hand lotion \u2014 you won\u2019t get any tsks from fellow passenger ladies on the subway.Like a Cartier tank watch face, the Le Labo silver canister is silver, sturdy, and handsome. Whenever the wax runs out (it comes in doses of 0.14 ounces), you can take it to the store and get it refilled in batches of two small wax refills for $79 \u2014 perhaps in different scents. I\u2019ve personally never deviated from the Noir 29 scent that Susie chose for me \u2014 it\u2019s a darker fresh scent with hints of tobacco and cedar \u2014 but there are all the others: Rose 31, Neroli 36, Vetiver 46. Anything but Santal 33 because everyone wears that.The aforementioned refills, in the writer\u2019s preferred scent.Writer (and new mom) Sara Gaynes Levy couldn\u2019t sleep, until she found this lavender aromatherapy stick. \u201cI rubbed the mix of lavender, ylang-ylang, and palmarosa on my wrists and neck like the tube suggested. The smell was addictive at first waft \u2014 calming and just a little sweet. I wanted more. I started reading in bed, and held my book in one hand and the stick in the other, taking deep breaths of the blend while concentrating on the text. I read for maybe five minutes before falling asleep. I did the same thing the next night, and it knocked me out again. This is good stuff.\u201dOur beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton is a self-professed scent lover who\u2019s also very sensitive to smells.
