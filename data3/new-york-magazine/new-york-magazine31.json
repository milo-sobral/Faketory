{"id": "The Best Small Artificial Christmas Trees on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve covered the best artificial Christmas trees, Christmas tree toppers, Christmas tree stands, Christmas lights and wreaths, and even the best scent for a fake Christmas tree, and now we\u2019re zeroing in on the best tabletop and small artificial Christmas trees \u2014\u00a0that is, those under five feet tall \u2014\u00a0on Amazon, organized from shortest (at 15 inches) to tallest (4.5 feet). (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI grew up with a tree similar to this and have been on the lookout for a similar one for years. This one is perfect! It\u2019s a great size for my house and looks beautiful. The bulb that comes with it could be a little brighter, but that was a simple switch out with a brighter bulb. I will definitely enjoy this for years to come.\u201d\u201cPerfect for what I wanted, which was a decoration for my kitchen table. The base is pretty enough as it is, and I used small ornaments I already had and it looked great. I have a seven-foot tree that is so heavy and lots of work to drag out and put away. I still wanted a tree, just a small, no-fuss one, and this tree filled the bill.\u201d\u201cThis little tree is absolutely perfect for our downsized Christmas display this year. The base is sturdy and heavy; the burlap covering is traditional and innocuous. The tree itself was fun to \u2018fluff out.\u2019 \u2026 There is plenty of greenery to give a realistic look, and generous spaces between the branches to hold our mercury glass heirloom ornaments. The pinecones are sturdy and well-attached. The tree is on a small table to add height. We put some photos on Facebook, and have gotten great compliments! We\u2019ll use this tree for years.\u201d\u201cI love this tree. I bought it after seeing an antique pink tinsel tree at an antique shop and thinking that it would be perfect for my desk area at work. It is a great size, about two feet tall as is advertised. The pink is VERY pink \u2014\u00a0like a hot pink, very bright. I kind of wanted a softer pink, but it is still very fun. And if you are ordering a pink tree, you are looking for fun. It does shed a bit during setup. It comes in a narrow box, all folded up, and you take it out, put it in its stand and fold down and out its branches and voila, you have your tree. Very easy. I hung it with silver ball garland and tiny silver and blue ornaments, and it looked lovely and fun.\u201d\u201cThis little tree has gotten the most attention that any other tree we\u2019ve put up. We usually buy live ten-foot and larger trees. Our live tree died before Christmas; for some reason, it wasn\u2019t absorbing water. Anyway, I replaced it with the Charlie Brown tree as a practical joke, and it was a HIT with our family and guests. We all loved the nostalgia!\u201d\u201cThis Christmas tree really exceeded my expectations. It is beautiful. The ornaments are already built into the tree and there is no need for added ornaments unless you choose to add some. The fiber optics are bright and vivid, the star is beautiful as is the base. Out of the box, it needs some adjusting, as all artificial trees do, but once that is done you have a simply beautiful tree to enjoy. I tried, in vain, to purchase one of these trees last year and waited in anticipation for it to become available again this year. I am so happy it did. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a beautiful, conversation piece, Christmas tree. I am considering purchasing a second one for another area of my home. I do love this tree!\u201d\u201cI am 72 years old and live alone. It is getting too difficult to assemble and dissemble a 7.5-foot\u00a0tree, so finally went to a smaller\u00a0tree. I am so glad I did and [I am] especially happy with my Balsam\u00a0tree. Not only did it come before the stated delivery date (which would have been after Christmas), it is beautiful. Even though it is small, it is very full \u2026 I am glad I paid a\u00a0little\u00a0more because I feel like this\u00a0tree\u00a0will last until I am no longer able to put up a\u00a0tree.\u201d\u201cThis was the perfect answer to my desire to downsize. I am elderly and found the 6.5-foot tree I had was too much to handle anymore. I still wanted a nice, full, but much shorter tree. \u2026 Best of all, the lights are a very nice white, not yellow-ish like all the other prelit trees I found. Also, they are not hot to the touch like my old tree. The tree was easy to assemble \u2026 I would recommend this tree to anyone who wants a really pretty, old-fashioned, full, but smaller tree. Everyone who visited really loved the tree as well.\u201d\u201cI bought this tree for my mom for Christmas to replace her old small artificial tree and she loves it! It arrived well packaged with instructions and plenty of extra bulbs and fuses. The base that holds the tree is made of metal (not cheap plastic) and is quite sturdy. The tree itself is quality made and looks realistic. The real surprise was when we plugged it in: Lots and lots of lights! My mom was delighted. No burnt out bulbs or problems and it lit up right away. It took about an hour altogether to set it up including \u2018fluffing\u2019 out the branches. \u2026 All in all, I highly recommend this tree to anyone looking for a well made and sturdy artificial tree that should last for years.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
