We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          It\u2019s likely you\u2019re not getting much sleep. Twenty percent of Americans have a sleep disorder (one in four people are afflicted with insomnia; 22 million have sleep apnea), and the average non-disordered sleeper is only getting 6.8 hours a night, which we all know by now is not enough. The situation is dire enough that sleep disorders were declared an actual public health epidemic in 2016.But, as they (who, I don\u2019t know) say, the more you know, the less you fear. So we polled 14 doctors, scientists, and authors on the books they recommend for demystifying the most mysterious 6.8 hours of the day. The Reading List includes writing on sleep disorders, sleeplessness in children, and sleep in general. Though it\u2019s a large field, every single one of our picks were recommended by at least two experts.Four of our experts recommended Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, the director of UC Berkeley\u2019s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab, making it the top suggestion on this list. The book answers important and often-asked questions about sleep (how do caffeine and alcohol affect how much we get? What happens during REM? How do common sleep aids affect us, and can they do long term damage?) with easy-to-read scientific evidence.\u201cI recommend Walker\u2019s new international best seller to all of my friends and family curious about sleep,\u201d says Dr. Jordan Stern, founder of the BlueSleep clinic. \u201cIt\u2019s a page-turner that simply explains what sleep is, why we need it, and what happens in our brain when we sleep and dream.\u201d Dr. Michelle Zeidler, a professor of clinical medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s an in-depth look,\u201d she said, \u201cat the effects sleep has on cognition, immune function, and metabolism.\u201d Dr. Philip Gehrman, an associate professor of clinical psychology\u00a0at UPenn, and Dr. Rebecca Robbins, of NYU Langone Health, also recommended it. \u201cThe best thing is how easy it is read,\u201d says Robbins.Two of our experts recommended The Promise of Sleep: A Pioneer in Sleep Medicine Explores the Vital Connection Between Health, Happiness, and a Good Night\u2019s Sleep. This title explores the price we\u2019ve paid for ignoring sleep: an epidemic of heart disease, 33 percent of traffic-fatigue-related accidents, and mental and psychological disadvantages. He also includes self-tests to help readers determine how much sleep they really need. \u201cThe author, William Dement, is like the Godfather of sleep medicine,\u201d says Dr. Jinyoung Kim, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis book had a major impact on my decision to study sleep patterns in humans,\u201d said Dr. Maja Bucan, a Professor at the Perelman School of Medicine. \u201cDement explains why sleep problems are linked to many medical conditions, and what those conditions are.\u201d\u201cInsomnia is tough to deal with,\u201d says Stern, \u201cand becoming much more prevalent thanks (not) to social media and electronic devices.\u201d To better understand it, two of our experts recommended The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix It, by W. Chris Winters. This book bills itself as a guide for anyone looking to achieve healthy sleep without pills, pain, or fatigue. It\u2019s about how sleep works (and the ways food, light, and computers hinder the process), why sleeping pills are often used incorrectly, and helps readers understand the different ways they can tackle insomnia, sleep apnea, and even restless leg syndrome.\u00a0Kutscher agrees with Stern on this recommendation: \u201cDr. Winter is among the most unique voices in sleep medicine, and his ability to\u00a0engage his patients in order to make tangible improvements to their sleep comes through successfully in his writing as well.\u201dThis book, recommended by two of our experts (Zeidler and Kutscher), takes readers through a six-week, drug-free program based in cognitive-behavior therapy and developed at Harvard Medical School. The program has been shown to improve sleep in the long term in 80 percent of patients, making it, as Jacobs says, the \u201cgold standard for sleep treatment.\u201dThe updated edition of the all-time best-selling book on children\u2019s sleep problems came at the recommendation of two experts. \u201cThat book is the gold standard for helping children sleep,\u201d says Stern. \u201cIt\u2019s all about behavior, especially the behavior of the parents. This how-to guide is required reading for all parents with small children.\u201d Zeidler agreed: \u201cI read it cover to cover when my kids were small.\u201d\u201cThere are many, many books available to parents struggling to help their young children get a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Christopher Cielo, attending pulmonologist in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cBut this evidence-based, easy-to-read book by one of the leading experts in behavioral sleep disorders in children has saved countless sleepless nights for innumerable patients, colleagues, and friends.\u201d Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University, and Dr. Sigrid Veasey of the University of Pennsylvania, both agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s delightful,\u201d said Carskadon.And for a bit of comedic reprieve: \u201cThis is therapy for the parents,\u201d says Zeidler. \u201cWhen my kids were little, I read this and laughed so hard I cried.\u201d \u201cThis is a bedtime book, not a sleep science book,\u201d said Gehrman. \u201cBut it\u2019s hysterical, so I included it anyhow.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
