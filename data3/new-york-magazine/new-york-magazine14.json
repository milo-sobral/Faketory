{"id": "The Gizmos to Buy Your Techie This Holiday (Before They Sell Out)", "paragraph": "If you don\u2019t consider yourself to be tech-savvy, it can be hard to find a good tech gift for the more electronically minded folks in your life, especially since the products themselves are constantly changing. So to figure out which tech gifts and electronics are actually worth the splurge this holiday, I spoke with Ben Arnold, senior director of innovation and trends at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which has produced an annual report on consumer technology holiday purchasing patterns for the last 25 years. According to its research, 66 percent of U.S. adults are planning to purchase a tech product as a gift this year, so to help you buy the actually nice gadgets before everyone else catches on, here are 13 electronics and appliances that are bound to be popular this holiday season.Voice speakers, or smart speakers, have been big sellers over the past couple of holiday seasons, and Arnold\u2019s research leads him to believe that they\u2019ll be popular once again, \u201cespecially since Amazon released several new products a couple of weeks ago.\u201d He anticipates that smart displays \u2014\u00a0\u201cwhich is a screen with all of the smart-speaker features built into it\u201d \u2014\u00a0are going to be especially popular, like the newest iteration of the Echo Show. With a larger screen and louder speaker than the first-generation Show, this device is better equipped to play TV shows or movies from Amazon Prime Video or Amazon Music; however, you need an Amazon Prime account in order to access most of these features.Google is also launching a new voice-activated speaker display for the holidays, called the Home Hub. This one connects to your Google account, so it can do things like display pictures from Google Photos or play your favorite YouTube videos \u2014\u00a0along with more standard Google Assistant tasks, like reading out your daily schedule or telling you what traffic on your commute will look like through Google Maps. One advantage of the Google devices over the Amazon ones is that you don\u2019t need to pay for any subscriptions to enjoy most of the functionality, but as far as which of these two smart displays to buy, Arnold doesn\u2019t think one is necessarily \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. \u201cI think of it more as what is going to complement my life the most as a consumer,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just depends on how invested you are in either ecosystem, and that\u2019s really the best way to go about it.\u201dAlso new this year is the interest in smart-home devices, like smart doorbells, which can be controlled by voice-activated devices like Echo or Google Assistant. \u201cConnected home products aren\u2019t super exciting to get for Christmas,\u201d Arnold admits, \u201cbut I think that the market has gotten to a point where there\u2019s a pretty good level of familiarity and awareness for the products.\u201d Sure, it\u2019s not as cuddly as a teddy bear, but Arnold says it\u2019s a matter of reframing your thoughts on what makes a good gift: \u201cWhen I think of maybe my mother or my grandmother, something like a security camera would bring them a lot of value and a lot of convenience and some peace of mind.\u201dThe biggest thing to consider if you are going to gift a smart doorbell or security camera is which digital assistant the recipient uses. If they\u2019re in the Amazon ecosystem and have an Amazon Prime membership and are maybe getting a couple of packages delivered each week, Ring is going to be the best bet, since it\u2019s owned by Amazon.But for a Google household, Nest is the way to go. The company that\u2019s also known for making smart thermostats was acquired by Google earlier this year, so its products seamlessly integrate with Google Assistant.Another fun add-on gift for someone with a digital assistant in their home would be a color-changing LED light bulb, like the Philips Hue. Just connect to their Echo, Google Assistant, or even Apple HomePod, and they\u2019ll be able to control the light in their homes with their voice. That includes specific programs for nighttime, morning, or even party time, if that\u2019s their vibe. \u201cThere\u2019s some excitement there for the right gift recipient,\u201d says Arnold.Arnold anticipates that this will be another good year for headphones, especially for what he calls \u201ctruly wireless\u201d earbuds. These are headphones that only connect to your device via Bluetooth, with no cords whatsoever. The front-runner in the space are Apple\u2019s AirPods, those white, wireless headphones that you\u2019ve probably seen all over the gym or the subway. But those only connect to Apple devices, and there are some complaints about sound quality \u2014\u00a0so if you\u2019re looking for Android-friendly or non-Apple alternatives, Arnold cited Bose as a company making high-quality, truly wireless headphones \u2026\u2026 Along with Jabra. The Elite 65e stands out because of its truly wireless and truly noise-canceling in-ear headphones. (AirPods certainly can\u2019t do that.)Approximately one in five U.S. adults plans to buy a smartwatch this holiday, according to CTA\u2019s research, and though it might be the most obvious option, the Apple Watch Series 3 is leading the way in this category. \u201cI think the updates to Apple Watch, especially with the cellular connectivity, has driven some more interest into the products,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised to see that it rates pretty highly in our study as well.\u201dHowever, Arnold doesn\u2019t discount smartwatches from other brands, and he\u2019s especially excited about some of the advances in fitness trackers. \u201cThose products add more features, things like echocardiograms and more accurate tracking of steps,\u201d he says. Plus, there\u2019s a big emphasis on personalization, with different color watch faces and bands. \u201cI think in the conversation of what is a great gift to get, something that is a little bit personalized plays into the gift-giving dynamic pretty well.\u201dFor a fitness tracker that\u2019s a little more analog-looking, Arnold likes the offerings from Withings, a French consumer-electronics company that makes connected health products. \u201cThey make an activity tracker, but it looks like a traditional watch, so it\u2019s an activity tracker that looks like a watch but that does not look like a smartwatch,\u201d he says.Drones were another popular holiday gift last year, and CTA anticipates that it\u2019ll continue to be a strong sector in 2018, with expected sales of 1.5 million unions. \u201cDrones are always cool,\u201d says Arnold, and the biggest advances this year are what he describes as form-factor changes. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of drones get smaller and more portable, with the ability to fold the drone up and put it into a bag for easy carrying.\u201d The DJI Spark is described as a \u201cmini-drone,\u201d but it\u2019s still pretty impressive. For instance, you can make the device take a photo while flying midair by waving your hand, no remote control or smartphone required.If you\u2019re looking for a sub-$100 option, the Parrot Mambo is a solid mini-drone. Like the DJI Spark, it has a camera and is easy to fly with a smartphone, but it lacks some of the higher-end features like taking a photo with just hand gestures.One trend that has remained constant over the last couple of years is consumers\u2019 desire for TVs during the holidays. In fact, televisions are consumers\u2019 most-wanted tech gift, according to CTA\u2019s research. \u201cCertainly 4K is the leading technology right now, the step-up technology,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cAnd what\u2019s exciting about that is, we\u2019re getting more and more 4K content available. So now you don\u2019t just have a 4K set. You\u2019ve also got really great content that\u2019s easy to find that you can watch.\u201d Upgrading to a 4K TV set is what\u2019s driving most of the demand, according to Arnold, and though there are super high-end and expensive options on the market, you can find that technology for less than $300.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
