{"id": "The Best Gifts for People Going Through a Breakup", "paragraph": "Finding the perfect holiday gift can be maddening \u2014 is this the color they\u2019d want? Is it something they already have? Is it so last year? \u2014 but really, once you have a sense of a person\u2019s taste, it\u2019s not impossible. This season, we\u2019ll be talking to members of various tribes (we\u2019re calling them the Hard-to-Shop-Fors) to find out exactly what to get that serious home cook, skin-care Redditor, or gamer in your life. Think of it as a window into their brain trust \u2014 or at least a very helpful starting point. Back in 2010, NPR reported on a study showing that the most common day of the year for couples to split up is the first Monday in December \u2014 or just a few weeks before Christmas. If a holiday-season breakup puts a damper on your plan to order that monogrammed towel set for your formerly in-love friends, or if you\u2019re just trying to show a little extra compassion, we consulted with Amy Chan, founder of the Renew Breakup Bootcamp retreat for the brokenhearted, to recommend gifts for loved ones going through a breakup. She also pointed us to recent Renew alum Taryn (who asked that we only use her first name), who shared the gifts she wished she\u2019d received in this tough time.Chan says when it comes to buying something for a friend after a breakup, \u201cgifts that are going to be conducive to their healing are going to be a lot more valuable\u201d than something that\u2019s just purely nice. One idea is putting together a few items your friend can use to create a calming, daily ritual. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have a routine that you\u2019re doing every single day,\u201d says Chan. \u201cIt actually helps you with your emotions.\u201d People often rely on relationships for regularity in life, so losing a partnership can leave your days feeling chaotic. Chan explains that emotions are closely linked to scent, so if you do something like burn Palo Santo incense during your morning ritual when you\u2019re in a peaceful state, catching a whiff of it when you\u2019re feeling sad or anxious can help bring you back to that neutral mind-set. \u201cPalo Santo\u2019s nice to clear the energy and clear the air,\u201d she says.Taryn agrees that scent-based gifts can be very effective at helping the recipient change their emotions. \u201cThe best gifts are the ones that have positive affirmations around them and provide a positive distraction,\u201d she says. She recommends giving a lavender-scented candle, as the flower\u2019s smell is known to be soothing. Go all-out with this elegant ceramic candle that looks as good as it smells.Or get this minimal candle that says it all. It actually smells like lavender, rose, and lily of the valley, but fits well when they\u2019re in the anger stage.According to Chan, \u201cCertain essential oils are meant for calming as well.\u201d Chan says she\u2019ll have Vitruvi diffusers on during meditation sessions at Renew, filled with soothing lavender and eucalyptus oils, and then send participants home with their own oils to help bring them back to a place of relaxation. Along with Vitruvi, she also likes doTerra\u2019s essential oils.As for what to wear during those chill self-care sessions, Taryn likes the ultrasoft pajama sets from PJ Salvage. They\u2019re just as comfortable as throwing on an old T-shirt and sweatpants, but help a person feel a little more put-together.For something a little more glamorous, Chan suggests a Kim + Ono robe. Unlike similar polyester alternatives, it\u2019s made from real silk, which\u2019ll make their daily rituals feel luxurious. \u201cWear your kimono around the apartment and wind down from the day,\u201d she says.We already know celebrities love these fizzy, nutrient-rich tablets, so it was interesting to hear Chan explain how they\u2019re useful during the most intense parts of a breakup. \u201cWhen people are going through a separation, it\u2019s quite common that they actually don\u2019t have an appetite at all. The body is trying to help you survive by managing cortisol and adrenaline \u2014 hunger is the last priority,\u201d she says. It\u2019s hard to deal with emotions without proper nutrition, though, so she recommends these for making sure your brokenhearted friend at least gets in the essentials.\u00a0\u201cDrinking all the nutrients you need can start helping your body get back in order.\u201dOn the other hand, Chan says these intense emotions can desensitize the taste buds, making people crave highly salty or highly sweet foods. If your friend doesn\u2019t have the energy to cook on their own \u2014 or is surviving off of pints of Ben & Jerry\u2019s \u2014 she likes gifting a healthy meal service,\u00a0like the plant-based Sakara.\u201cWe have an elixir bar at the retreat, with calming teas and CBD oil,\u201d says Chan. \u201cA lot of people have anxiety after a breakup, and CBD could be helpful with calming down the nerves.\u201d She keeps the bar stocked with oil from Ned, which harvests its hemp up in the Rocky Mountains.These CBD capsules, from the socially conscious brand Endoca, has appeared among our readers\u2019 best sellers since we first wrote about it back in April. Taken as a pill, it\u2019s an easy way to reap CBD\u2019s chill-out benefits.Those left reeling after a breakup are often full of questions about what went wrong and how to heal for future relationships. Taryn says this book, which came recommended from her mother, was essential in helping her move through this process. \u201cIt allowed for a space to see things in a different perspective and understand my part in everything \u2014 the relationship and breakup,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helped begin to rewire my thinking and create positive energy in a very negative state.\u201dLearning about one\u2019s attachment style \u2014 the way we relate to others that\u2019s formed during early childhood \u2014 also provides insight on creating new, positive relationships. Chan says about 90 percent of people who go through her boot camp have an anxious attachment style characterized by a deeply ingrained fear of being abandoned or rejected. \u201cWhen you understand it, it starts to click. Like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s why I react to intimacy this way,\u201d she says. She recommends reading this book for more of those revelatory \u201caha!\u201d moments.One way of helping a friend get through a breakup is to encourage them to think about all of the other good things they have going for them. \u201cPracticing gratitude is a big part of the healing process,\u201d says Chan. \u201cStudies have shown [gratitude journaling] can actually change your brain when done over a period of 30 days straight.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for something they can keep bedside that doesn\u2019t scream self-help, a simple, nice-looking notebook will do the job. This one is writer Molly Young\u2019s favorite. Chan says journaling can be part of a morning or evening grounding ritual.If your friend needs a push to get started, try this guided gratitude journal that Strategist writer Maxine Builder picked up over the summer.
