{"id": "The Best Christmas Tree Decorations on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy (like pillows), but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written about the best artificial Christmas trees before \u2014 as well as tree stands and toppers \u2014 here we\u2019ve rounded up the best-reviewed tree decorations, lights, and ornaments on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI absolutely love these lights. I bought them for Christmas, and I put a string in a basket of flowers, another string in a tabletop Christmas tree, another string in a vase of flowers \u2014 you can use them anywhere because they\u2019re battery operated. They are quite bright for such small lights, and they are just wonderful. I couldn\u2019t be happier. They\u2019re an excellent addition to my Christmas decorations. I definitely intend to buy some more sets of these lights because once I started putting them around the house, I just wanted more and more of them!\u201d\u201cJust received these lights and so far they are awesome. I use them year-round on a artificial tree in my house. They are lightweight and look beautiful. I would purchase again.\u201d\u201cI love this thing! The tree was literally lit up in ten minutes. Really looks nice, and gives you a lot of options for patterns. We have a pre-lit tree with white lights, and it has those \u2018snow-covered\u2019 branches. The light colors bounce nicely around the tree this way. I love being able to change the colors and patterns. Our 5-year-old grandson also loves helping choose the color and pattern combo.\u201d\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find these in stores, so we were grateful we could order them online. Hubby and I both grew up with these on our Christmas trees, so this bit of nostalgia was appreciated. Our tree was so sparkly and pretty that we were sad to take it down. We preserved most of the icicles, though, so they\u2019ll be used again next Christmas!\u201d\u201cI cannot believe how wonderful these garlands turned out to be! I was concerned about the price, but when I got the garlands out of their bag, they were just as advertised \u2014 thick and full!! They are so well-made that they almost feel like a feather boa in your hands. The colors (I ordered blue) were so vibrant that they just pop on the tree. I had ordered two packages of these for the tree and just ordered another two for decorating my fireplace mantel and entertainment center to match the tree.\u201d\u201cI have a new kitten this year, and she is untrustworthy around shiny things. I did not want to put my antique and vintage ornaments on my tree this year, so I ordered these shatterproof ornaments. I was surprised how beautiful they are. They look so great on my tree, and they really look very expensive. They are larger than the average round ornament, but I am so happy I bought them. And, wouldn\u2019t you know, the kitten leaves them alone! I highly recommend these ornaments.\u201d\u201cI ordered one set to fill in some empty spots on the tree, and as soon as I opened these I ordered a second set. They are made very well, they are beautiful, and are even prettier than the picture. The delivery was very fast and they are in perfect condition. They look very expensive.\u201d\u201cThese are perfect for a small Christmas tree. They have a nice variety of patterns to break up the repetitiveness of solid color ornaments. If you\u2019re trying to decorate a small tree on a budget but want something better than the $5 bucket of plastic ornaments from the drugstore, these are a nice place to start.\u201d\u201cSince I didn\u2019t have time for a big tree this year I purchased a small one. I ordered several packages of these bulbs and they were perfect. They shine like glass, have rich color, and reflect light from the tree\u2019s lights and tinsel. And when dropped to the floor they don\u2019t break or take any damage. When I do have a large tree again I\u2019ll also use these bulbs to fit into those small areas on it. Great purchase!\u201d\u201cI love these ornaments! They were given as Christmas gifts to some co-workers, and everyone loved them. I love the country design. They were a good size, and light enough to hang on the tree. Some ornaments are just too heavy to sit on the tree; these were perfect. I would absolutely get more.\u201d\u201cIn anticipation of the holidays, I searched and purchased a two-foot Christmas tree that I hope will bring cheer to the workplace. I was in search of mini-decorations that would compliment the tree. When I saw these, I loved the variety of designs of the ornaments. Surely, whoever looks at the tree will admire the delicately painted wooden ornaments and their character. The ornaments are tiny, but I feel that I might be able to use most, if not all, of them on the tree. Also, children are often around, and I think they are going to really enjoy the different ornaments.\u201d\u201cGreat set of nutcracker ornaments. Excellent color, shape, and detail. They are a great addition to my \u201cNutcracker Suite\u201d collection and a value sold as a set. They\u2019re fragile, but better than the glass pieces in my collection. Save the box for storage after Christmas.\u201d\u201cPurchased this ornament as a gift for my wife who loves golden retrievers. The colors on the dog are vibrant and nice \u2014 they certainly aren\u2019t dull, and the dog doesn\u2019t get lost on the tree like some ornaments can because on their colors. The dog also actually looks like a golden retriever \u2014 a lot of times, you see ornaments and such that just don\u2019t really look like a golden or a Lab, but I definitely think this puppy does. The ornament also feels nice and solid, and doesn\u2019t feel like a cheap, flimsy ornament that you could easily crush with your fingers.\u201dNote: Other breeds, including cockapoos, spaniels, and Yorkies, are also available. \u201cAdorable representations of the wonderful wildlife that visits my yard, woods, and gardens. They are so lightweight that they are perfect for those hard-to-decorate areas on the tree that can\u2019t support heavier ornaments. So glad I purchased these!\u201d\u201cI got this ornament as a present for my Doctor Who\u2013loving husband (and admittedly, for myself as well), and I can\u2019t tell you how pleased I was with it. This ornament is stunning. It\u2019s the most beautiful ornament on our tree, all thanks to the gorgeous blue paint. I can\u2019t get over how beautiful the paint is \u2014 it almost glows. The details, like the police box notice and the windows, are so tiny and precise. My husband was thrilled to put this on our tree, and I can\u2019t wait to have it on our tree again next year!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very happy with the Downton Abbey ornament! It is exactly as I expected it to be. I purchased two to give as gifts, but am very tempted to buy a third for myself. The picture is very accurate, except that the paint (on the lettering and windows) is a tiny bit more crisp on the picture than on the actual ornament. I\u2019m amazed at the detail on all the Gothic architectural features!\u201d\u201cI purchased five of these as senior-night gifts for the seniors on my daughter\u2019s volleyball team. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with them for the price. They are beautiful ornaments with nice details. The silver sparkle against the pearly white is a nice touch that gives them a very elegant look. They are very pretty and delicate, and I think the girls are going to love them.\u201dNote: These are available for fans of other sports like basketball, soccer, and tennis.\u201cThis is the cutest ornament ever. You wouldn\u2019t think that there would be much attention paid to the case, but it\u2019s amazing with the details \u2014 just like a regular guitar case that was shrunk down. It is a quality case, which is very sturdy and protective of the little guitar, and the miniature clasps open and close.
