{"id": "Is Antonio Delgado Getting a Bad Rap?", "paragraph": "When the O+ Festival, a celebration of \u201cart and music and wellness\u201d took over the picturesque upstate town of Kingston, New York, murals were being painted in alleyways,\u00a0bluegrass bands spilled out of coffee shops, and there was a free Reiki workshop. A woman tap danced beneath a sign that said \u201c30 Minutes Negativity Limit, Karma Enforced.\u201d Michelle Williams was spotted up the street with her small children, and Janeane Garofalo headlined the \u201cComedy Resistance\u201d show.At  the edge of the whole circus, Antonio Delgado stood under an awning,  away from the rain. Delgado is one of the more unlikely political  stories of 2018, and there on the street in Kingston, it was not hard to  see why. Kingston, population 23,000, is the biggest city in New York\u2019s  19th  Congressional District, a large swath of the rural Hudson Valley and  Catskills region that is the size of Rhode Island and Connecticut  combined. The district is also nearly all white, and Delgado, who, at  six-foot-four, towers above most everyone else at the street festival,  is not.Yet polls have shown the race in the 19th district to be one of the purest toss-ups in the country, one resting on a knife edge, with Delgado up several points in some, and Faso up in others. (FiveThirtyEight currently\u00a0gives Delgado a 64 percent chance of winning.) The 19th is precisely the kind of Obama-Trump seat that Democrats need to win if they have any hope of taking a majority in the House.The  tattooed and shredded crowd in Kingston was looking for answers. The  Senate was voting on Brett Kavanaugh, and many who came up to Delgado  had advice about how to deal with the Republicans \u2014 and in particular  how to take the fight to John Faso, the 66-year-old incumbent  congressman, who shed his moderate image to become a reliable yes vote  for Trump and the House Republicans.It\u2019s  a record that had Democratic blood boiling among festival goers in  Kingston. One older woman gave Delgado a hug and posed for a selfie  while saying that she, an apparent dabbler in Wicca, had put a hex on  Faso.To each voter who expressed anguish  or anger, Delgado flashed a smile, and preached patience and  understanding. \u201cThis blind partisan rage, it is tearing us apart,\u201d he  said to one concerned festivalgoer. \u201cWe need to inject some empathy in  our politics,\u201d he told another. \u201cThere is just too much cruelty right  now.\u201d (\u201cYou are right, you are right,\u201d the man, bespectacled and  sporting a gray ponytail, conceded. \u201cI am just coming to you from a  place of panic right now.\u201d)\u201cLove  is love, man,\u201d Delgado said later in the day, his large frame folded in  a tiny room that serves as a campaign office on a dreary stretch of the  main street in Monticello, New York, a 6,000-person town that fell into  disrepair after Catskills tourism dried up in the 1960s, and which  never really recovered. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American running in a district  that is 87 percent white and what I hear over and over is that if you  lead with your heart, if you demonstrate that you care about people, and  you engage, it is very hard to turn away from that for most people.\u201dDelgado  is just 41, and his story diverges from and intersects with that of  many strivers who came of age in the Clinton era. A basketball star at a  local Schenectady Catholic high school, he ended up at a lily-white  liberal-arts college, Colgate University. A campus leader who hosted his  own public affairs show on the school\u2019s television station, he was  named a Rhodes Scholar and went to Harvard Law, where he met his wife,  Lacey Schwartz. (Schwartz went on to achieve some notoriety for a  documentary she made in 2015 that described her discovery that although  she grew up Jewish and in a Jewish family, she is actually half black  from an affair her mother had with a family friend.) The couple landed  in New York, where she got a job at an organization that promotes ethnic  and racial diversity among Jews, while he went to work at the  high-powered law firm Akin Gump. They had twin boys, settled in  Montclair, New Jersey. After the 2016 election, the family moved to the  Hudson Valley \u2014 Lacey is from Woodstock \u2014 when it was clear there was  going to be a chance to run for Congress.Both Delgado\u2019s parents worked at General Electric, once a major employer in the region. He was a latchkey kid; they clipped coupons and moved from rental apartment to rental apartment to save up money for their first home. Both left the company amid downsizing.After  Harvard Law, Delgado moved out to Los Angeles to start a career in  music, running a record production company that used hip-hop as a way to  teach young people about social activism and political engagement.It  was a decision that was hard to explain to his parents, who had just  watched their son graduate from one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious law  schools with a pile of student-loan debt.\u201cThat  was \u2026 not their vision for me,\u201d he told me, choosing his words  carefully. \u201cBut I think my parents knew that I was always interested in  figuring out who I was and living an authentic existence. I had already  taken so many paths that weren\u2019t in the cards for someone like me, so  they were like, here is just one more thing, even if it is something we  don\u2019t fully comprehend.\u201dDelgado\u2019s  vision was to use hip-hop to introduce young people to issues of social  justice and civic engagement. That period of his life has since become  central in the late stages of the campaign. Faso and national  Republicans seized on an album Delgado wrote and rapped on under the  name AD the Voice in which he says, \u201ccriticize \u2014 it\u2019s what a patriot  does\u201d and \u201cGod Bless Iraq.\u201d Like a lot of hip-hop, the album is  sprinkled with misogynistic and racially charged lyrics.A  super-PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan has paid for ads  called \u201cWho Is the Real Antonio Delgado,\u201d featuring the candidate  rapping as a younger man, juxtaposed with footage of Delgado\u2019s own  campaign ads, with his wholesome life and young family. Ominously, and,  unsubtly, the ad ends with a darkened shot of Delgado in a hoodie.The  backlash has been intense. The district\u2019s previous Republican  congressman denounced the ads, a local radio station refused to air  them, and several dozen clergy wrote to Faso calling it racist. When a  popular pundit, Gerald Benjamin, a longtime political science professor  at SUNY New Paltz, said\u00a0to the New York\u00a0Times,  \u201cPeople like us, people in rural New York, we are not people who  respond to this culture,\u201d he was widely denounced, including by his  university president, and he quickly apologized. Faso has said that  Delgado\u2019s lyrics \u201cdenigrated our nation and the free enterprise system,  and often glorified pornography and drug use,\u201d but also said that he  couldn\u2019t do anything about the ads, since they were put out by an  outside group.\u201cIt\u2019s  a play that comes out of a playbook that\u2019s got a lot of rust on it,  making me out to be something I am not,\u201d Delgado says, a Wendy\u2019s paper  soda cup from dinner sitting untouched in front of him. Talking about  hip-hop was a way, he said, of not talking about health care or the  environment or education.\u201cI  think it is by design. They don\u2019t want to have these conversation. We  can do more. We can be a lot better at this. Because unless we change it  we are going to remain in this tailspin.\u201dDemocrats  have suffered in the Hudson Valley in part because they keep nominating  the wrong kind of candidate: New York City liberals who know the area  mostly as a weekend playground, a demographic which generates  understandable resentment. In the primary, Washington Democrats rallied  around Pat Ryan, a West Point graduate and Iraq veteran, while many in  New York backed Gareth Rhodes, a former aide to Governor Andrew Cuomo.  Delgado was seen by activists as too much of a centrist \u2014 he prefers a  public option over single-payer health care, and declined to back a bill  that would place a moratorium on new fossil-fuel projects and move the  country to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. And then of course  there was the obvious question:\u00a0Could he really win?The  district voted twice for Obama, but the Voting Rights Act was written,  in part, based on the belief that white people won\u2019t vote for candidates  of color. And Delgado asks voters to be open-minded in a way that Obama  never did. Imagine if instead of writing about his own journey of  self-discovery, Obama had called poverty \u201cthe purest form of terrorism,\u201d  and wrote, \u201cLook, we only goin\u2019 from chains to cuffs, still N\u2014s still  locked up, stuck on stuff.\u201d\u201cHaha,  you guys just nominated the worst candidate possible! A rapper?!?\u201d  Sajaa Ahmed, a local Democratic activist, says a Republican friend  texted her on the night of the primary.Delgado\u2019s  background \u201cwas an issue for a lot of people,\u201d says Ahmed, who hosts a  popular political podcast that covers the district, in which there are  no major TV markets. \u201cEven Democrats were wondering if this district  will elect a black congressman. It would have been easier to have  nominated one of the six white candidates.\u201dOn  her podcast, Delgado addressed the issue head-on, telling Ahmed that  voters who would be susceptible to the kind of naked racial appeals that  the GOP was sure to use \u2014 another more recent ad featured shots of  liquor stores, ominous warnings about food stamps and welfare and  Delgado\u2019s \u201cNew York City values\u201d \u2014 probably weren\u2019t going to vote for a  Democrat anyway.\u201cThere  are a lot of folks in my district who voted for Obama and they voted  for Trump. Those are the folks who I think wanted more from their  representatives. They want to feel like they are being heard,\u201d Delgado  told me. \u201cThat is what I am tapping into \u2014 a sense that folks think they  are going to get true representation, someone who is going to be  beholden to them and not to corporate PACs.\u201dDelgado\u2019s  story, though, isn\u2019t really one of the plucky underdog who takes on the  machine and wins. He brings plenty of parts of the machine with him. He  raised $2.7 million for the primary, and has continued the pace since,  raising $3.8 million in the third quarter alone, nearly four times what  Faso has raised and one of the biggest hauls of any challenger in the  country.Danielle  Gray, a former Obama aide who went to Harvard Law with Delgado,  convened Obama-world supporters. His connections to the Manhattan  white-shoe legal community helped too. Brooklyn congressman Hakeem  Jeffries and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were early  backers. Bradley Tusk, a top aide to Mike Bloomberg and a venture  capitalist, met with Delgado just as he was exploring a bid.\u201cI  wasn\u2019t sure he would necessarily fit the district, but I thought he was  compelling,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cI talk to a lot of would-be candidates, and it  didn\u2019t seem like it was manifest destiny with him, it was not, \u2018I am  really ambitious and the next thing I need on my Wikipedia page is for  it to say congressman.\u2019\u201dIt isn\u2019t just money and connections that gave Delgado his advantage. The 19th District is enormous, lacks cell-phone coverage in a lot of it, and even larger stretches of it are places with vanishingly few Democratic votes. Delgado was relentless, though, in hunting for spare votes in every corner, in part to signal to more persuadable voters that he was building a big tent. And so throughout most of this year and last, it\u2019s been hard to find a lumberjack festival, tractor pull, or fireman competition across this part of New York where Delgado wasn\u2019t working the crowds.\u201cI  underestimated him at first,\u201d added Gareth Rhodes, the former Cuomo  aide who came in second in the primary. \u201cMost candidates, they are  either out there nonstop, or they raise a ton of money. Somehow he  managed to do both.\u201dBut  the political pros who feared that nominating Delgado would hurt  Democratic chances weren\u2019t necessarily wrong. It is clear even in the  context of a rural congressional race that Antonio Delgado is a serious  political talent, someone who could have a long career in state  politics. But he has to win in his backyard first, and the prospects of  that are far from clear.Faso  has both deep roots in the district \u2013 but also some profound political  vulnerabilities. A longtime Albany lobbyist prior to winning his seat in  2016 as the district swung markedly to the right, Faso helped provide  the decisive vote that passed the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal plan out of  committee, backed the repeal of Dodd-Frank, defended the Trump  administration\u2019s child separation policy and voted to allow concealed  carry permits operate across state lines.Delgado has been running ads slamming Faso for a moment caught on tape in which he promised a woman suffering from a brain tumor that he wouldn\u2019t vote to take away her health care, even though by their lights six weeks later he did (Faso has said the ad is misleading.) Most notably, Faso has avoided the spectacle of a town hall to explain his health care vote, which led to a Democratic congressman from a neighboring district, Sean Patrick Maloney, to travel to Faso\u2019s turf and host one in his stead.And  so Delgado, despite all of the \u201cThere is too much anger in our  politics,\u201d has started to show himself unafraid to twist the knife in  Faso. On a Saturday night last month in Monticello, over a hundred  voters came out to a Delgado town hall at dreary recreational center a  few blocks away from the downtown. The room was nearly all white and  older, blue jeans and baseball caps over gray heads. Some even said they  were from neighboring districts, but had come to see someone who can  flip a seat blue. They were probably all Democrats, too, or at least  Deglado supporters, and although he talked of healing the broken  divisions of politics, he also described the current congressman as  bought and bossed by corporate interests, willing to take away health  care from the people of the Hudson Valley if it\u2019s what his big-money  donors ask for.\u201cThere  is a lot of pain going on. You would think the sitting congressman  would know something about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is he?\u201dThe audience loved it, standing and clapping as he eviscerated Faso.\u201cWe  know what is going on in D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have a representative  that is absent! That isn\u2019t doing the work! I want to be held  accountable! I want your trust!\u201dHe had won the room. It\u2019s a big district though, and the election is only days away.First responders have brought thousands of pets rescued from the Camp fire to California animal shelters (including many that suffered burns) \u2014 but this dog is still with his personStacey Abrams\u2019s plan to fight for Georgia\u2019s democracy in courtAbrams said the [new federal] lawsuit, which will fall under the umbrella of a new organization called\u00a0Fair Fight Georgia, will look toward improving the state\u2019s election system prior to municipal elections in 2019 and the 2020 presidential election. Fair Fight may also push for legislative changes at the Capitol, and Abrams said it will hold the state accountable for running elections fairly.\u201cWe have to consider all the pieces that go into voter suppression and diminishing the ability of voters to cast their ballots,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means looking at the staffing and sourcing of polling stations, making sure that there are an adequate number of machines, making certain that poll workers who are often volunteers aren\u2019t judging whether or not someone gets to vote based on how many pieces of paper they have left.\u201dAs for whether she will challenge U.S. Sen. David Perdue in 2020 or seek another bid for governor in four years, Abrams is mum. But she is confident her legal challenges will help continue to expand Georgia\u2019s electorate.\u201cWe know that over the next two years there will be new people who will find themselves energized by politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think what we can do in 2020 is absolutely complete the transformation that started this year. It won\u2019t only be at the top of the ticket, but also down the ticket.\u201dNewly discovered emails link pro-Brexit campaign with Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon, and the Mercer familyThe possibility that both Brexit and the Trump campaign simultaneously relied upon the same social-media company and its transgressive tactics, as well as some of the same advisers, to further far-right nationalist campaigns, set off alarm bells on both sides of the Atlantic. Damian Collins, a member of Parliament, and chair of its Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which held an inquiry into fake news,\u00a0told the\u00a0Observer, which has broken much of the news about Cambridge Analytica in the U.K., that the new e-mails \u201csuggest that the role of Bannon and Mercer is far deeper and more complex than we realised. There\u2019s a big question about whether Mercer\u2019s money was used in the Brexit campaign and it absolutely underscores why Britain needs a proper Mueller-style investigation. There are direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump. We\u2019ve got to recognise the bigger picture here. This is being coordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201dThe American investigations into foreign interference in Trump\u2019s election, and British probes into Brexit, have increasingly become interwoven. The role of the Russian Ambassador to the U.K., Alexander Yakovenko, has reportedly been the subject of interest both to Mueller\u2019s investigators and to those in the U.K., who have examined his relationship to Banks. The role of\u00a0Nigel Farage, the former leader of the far-right, Euroskeptic U.K. Independence Party, who has been an ally of Bannon and Trump, has also reportedly stirred the interest of investigators in both countries, especially after he was spotted in 2017 leaving the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, in which Julian Assange has taken refuge. Assange\u2019s media platform, WikiLeaks, published many of the e-mails stolen by Russia from the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 election season.How and whether all of these pieces fit together is the subject of Mueller\u2019s investigation, but the lack of a similar single, overarching investigation in the U.K. has led critics to call for one.Reminder: Forest floor raking or not, last summer was really bad for wildfires in EuropeThroughout the Northern Hemisphere this summer, heat waves have been shattering records and sustaining wildfires of unprecedented fury. In Greece [on July 24th], ninety-one people died in a hellish fire\u2014Europe\u2019s deadliest since 1900\u2014that broke out eighteen miles east of Athens and, powered by unusually dry vegetation and strong winds, blazed across a resort town on the Aegean Sea. On July 17th, in Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland, more than fifty miles north of the Arctic Circle, the thermometer read a previously unseen ninety degrees; in Sweden, wildfires swept across Lapland; in Norway, there have been three times more wildfires this summer than normal. In much of Germany, drought conditions have persisted since May, the Rhine [was] dangerously\u00a0low, and authorities in the city of Potsdam, outside Berlin, were afraid [in late July] that a wildfire burning around the nearby small town of Fichtenwalde would set off Second World War\u2013era ammunition that remains buried in the area\u2019s forest and meadows.The link between the California fires and the changing climateFinns seize long-awaited opportunity to debunk/dunk on President Trump over his raking comment@Akihheikkinen:\u201cFinland has ~73% forest coverage = 222,180 square kilometers of forests (world bank study). Our forests are densest in the world, averaging 72,000 trees in sq km. That\u2019s 22 billion trees or 4,500 for every Finn (yale university study). Please send help. Must bring own rakes.\u201d@Mallahadley:\u201cI grew up in Finland. a) it rains all year round. b) we have a lengthy and cold winter. c) Finland is a sparsely populated country with just over 5mil ppl, with land size ~3/4 of CA and most of it forests and lakes. d) no friggin body is raking the forests.\u201d@Lahavu:\u201cWe have had pretty much the warmest year ever. It has been +5-7C here in the east this week. The summer was one of the driest and hottest ever and that\u2019s why we had quite many fires. On an average year fires are a non-issue. I didn\u2019t complain about the heat myself (I love warm weather). It\u2019s just that it tells you how climate change is changes our climate and that is certainly not good.\u201dNSC member in charge of U.S. Saudi policy has resignedThe official, Kirsten Fontenrose, had pushed for tough measures against the Saudi government, and had been in Riyadh to discuss a raft of sanctions that the American government imposed in recent days against those identified as responsible for the killing, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Specifically, she advocated that Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, be added to the list, and he ultimately was.The exact circumstances of her departure are murky, and it is unclear whether her advocacy for a hawkish response to the killing angered some in the White House. When she returned to Washington, according to the two people, she had a dispute with her bosses at the National Security Council, where she had served as the director for the Persian Gulf region.The unknown long-term harm of inhaling wildfire smokeMost research has focused on how smoke exposure affects firefighters or how air pollution, not wildfire smoke specifically, affects people\u2019s health. Many large studies have linked air pollution to heart and lung diseases;\u00a0one 2012 study\u00a0found that pregnant women who were exposed to smoke during the 2003 wildfires in Southern California delivered babies with slightly lower birth weight than normal. \u2026There are similarities between particles found in air pollution from fossil fuels and those found in wildfire smoke. Both contain toxic particles that are invisible to the naked eye that can penetrate into lung tissue and get into the bloodstream. These particles are 2.5 micrometers in size \u2014 about one-fortieth the width of a strand of hair. There are also differences, though, that scientists don\u2019t fully understand.When residential areas burn, they release chemicals into the atmosphere that aren\u2019t emitted when wooded or grassy areas burn. Plastics, household cleaning products, metals from vaporized stoves and washing machines, and synthetic materials from carpets add to poor air conditions. Researchers don\u2019t know what kind of long-term health conditions could be caused or exacerbated by exposure to these compounds.Stranded in Chico\u2019s \u201cWallywood\u201d and other places of refuge for Camp fire evacueesHundreds of evacuees are squatting at camp in a Walmart parking lot \u2014 a ramshackle village some inhabitants call Wallywood, a sardonic mash-up of their location and reduced circumstances. \u2026\u201cBig picture, we have 6,000, possibly 7,000 households who have been displaced and who realistically don\u2019t stand a chance of finding housing again in Butte County,\u201d county housing official Mayer said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if these households can be absorbed in California.\u201dThe county has the capacity to place 800 to 1,000 households in permanent housing, Mayer said. Housing was already scarce in Butte County before the Camp Fire. The housing vacancy rate was less than 2 percent, which \u201cis considered a crisis state,\u201d Mayer said. Unlike wealthier Sonoma County, where fires destroyed thousands of homes last year, many residents of Paradise don\u2019t have the financial means to rebuild their homes quickly.Closing in on the biggest midterm (popular vote) wave in three decadesAssuming [the Democrats\u2019 national lead in House votes] gets up into the ~8.5[%] range, Democrats are also on track to have the largest House popular vote margin by either party in a midterm since 1986, when they it by 9.9 points. D\u2019s did win it by 10.6 points in 2008, but that was a presidential year.Andrew Gillum concedes Florida governor\u2019s race, againWaiting for the president to passTrump visiting what\u2019s left of ParadiseHe also promised to put $500 million \u201cin the farm bill for management and maintenance of forests\u201dMake America Rake AgainWe\u2019re all committed \u2014 I\u2019m committed to make sure that we\u2019ve got all of this cleaned out, and protected. Gotta take care of the floors, you know, the floors of the forest. It\u2019s very important. You look at other countries where they do it differently, and, it\u2019s a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland, and he said, \u201cWe have a, much different \u2014 we\u2019re a forest nation.\u201d He called it \u201ca forest nation.\u201d And they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem. And when it is, it\u2019s a very small problem. So, uh, I know everybody\u2019s looking at that. To that end. And it\u2019s gonna work out. It\u2019s gonna work out well.The Bystander in Chief[S]hortly after becoming commander in chief, President Trump asked so few questions in a briefing at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., that top military commanders cut the number of prepared PowerPoint slides to three \u2014 they had initially planned 18 \u2014 said two officials with knowledge of the visit. The commanders had slotted two hours for the meeting, but it lasted less than one.Rhetorically, Mr. Trump has embraced the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as \u201cmy military\u201d and \u201cmy generals\u201d and has\u00a0posted on Twitter\u00a0that under his leadership, the American armed forces will be \u201cthe finest that our Country has ever had.\u201d But top Defense Department officials say that Mr. Trump has not fully grasped the role of the troops he commands, nor the responsibility that he has to lead them and protect them from politics.\u201cThere was the belief that over time, he would better understand, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Col. David Lapan, a retired Marine who served in the Trump administration in 2017 as a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he understands the proper use and role of the military and what we can, and can\u2019t, do.\u201dMeanwhileTranslation: \u201cWe still want to believe the Saudis\u201d\u201cWhile Facebook surely does exhibit liberal bias in some ways, they have also dramatically \u2014 and, in the end, devastatingly \u2014 overcorrected for that bias.\u201dFacebook didn\u2019t tiptoe to avoid poking the bear on the left. They went right up to the bear and stabbed it repeatedly. And then goaded the right\u2019s bear to join in the stabbing.The power of leftist outrage mobs has been well-discussed. The power of conservative outrage mobs to affect corporate and political policy,\u00a0even from left-leaning organizations, is arguably less acknowledged.In no small part to placate the right, the liberal company Facebook misled the nation again and again about the nature of Russian interference in the election. They repeatedly fed right wing conspiracies while waving away criticism from the left. It\u2019s hard to see how an ardently Trumpist company could do much better.Historians claim 2018 is not the worst year to be aliveAsk medieval historian Michael McCormick what year was the worst to be alive, and he\u2019s got an answer: \u201c536.\u201d Not 1349, when the Black Death wiped out half of Europe. Not 1918, when the flu killed 50 million to 100 million people, mostly young adults. But 536. In Europe, \u201cIt was the beginning of one of the worst periods to be alive, if not the worst year,\u201d says McCormick, a historian and archaeologist who chairs the Harvard University Initiative for the Science of the Human Past.A mysterious fog plunged Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia into darkness, day and night\u2014for 18 months. \u201cFor the sun gave forth its light without brightness, like the moon, during the whole year,\u201d wrote Byzantine historian Procopius. Temperatures in the summer of 536 fell 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C, initiating the coldest decade in the past 2300 years. Snow fell that summer in China; crops failed; people starved. The Irish chronicles record \u201ca failure of bread from the years 536\u2013539.\u201d Then, in 541, bubonic plague struck the Roman port of Pelusium, in Egypt. What came to be called the Plague of Justinian spread rapidly, wiping out one-third to one-half of the population of the eastern Roman Empire and hastening its collapse, McCormick says.A television viewer who does not understand forests, science, firefighting, or management continues to share his opinions about the use of forest management in fire preventionPresident Trump, to Fox News in a new interview:\u201cI was watching the firemen the other day, and they were raking areas \u2014 they were raking areas. When the fire is right over there and they are raking trees, little trees like this, that are, not trees \u2014 little bushes. That you could see are totally dry. Weeds. And they are raking them \u2014 they are on fire. That should have been all raked out \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t have the fires. \u2026 Maybe [climate change] contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management. \u2026 You need forest management. I\u2019m not saying that in a negative way, a positive \u2014 I\u2019m just saying the facts.\u201dAnd to reporters before heading to California on Saturday to have a firsthand look at the wildfire crisis:\u201c[California officials and I] will be talking about forest management. I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. It should have been a lot different situation. But the one thing is that everybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing, and there\u2019s no question about it. It should have been done many years ago. But I think everybody\u2019s on the right side. It\u2019s a big issue, it\u2019s a big issue, a very expensive issue, but very, very inexpensive when you compare it to even one of these horrible fires. And we\u2019ll save a lot of lives.\u201dThe logging industry stands with Trump, per the Washington Times:\u201cThere is truth to statements he has made,\u201d said Daniel Dructor, executive vice president of the American Loggers Council, a coalition of state and regional associations that represents independent contract loggers. \u201cIt\u2019s time to rise above political posturing and recognize that active forest management \u2014 including logging, thinning, grazing and controlled burning \u2014 are tools that can and must be used to reduce fire risks and help mitigate the impacts to landscapes,\u201d Mr. Dructor said in a statement.Pesky science, via the AP:One reason that scientists know that management isn\u2019t to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren\u2019t \u201cfuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\u201d [Utah fire scientist Philip] Dennison said. In those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.The other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about forest management. These aren\u2019t forests,\u201d he said.The dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \u201cis much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\u201dThe socioeconomics of saving your home from wildfires[T]he fire department\u2019s capacity crunch in the face of devastating and erratic fires has showcased a growing social divide. In areas where some residents felt the need to put their lives on the line, celebrities and affluent homeowners filled the gap with private firefighters to protect their mansions from burning.In an\u00a0article published last spring, NBC highlighted that the insurance giant AIG offers wealthy homeowners access to their Wildfire Protection Unit, certified through authorities to respond to fires that threaten million-dollar homes.TMZ\u00a0reported\u00a0this week that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hired\u00a0private firefighters\u00a0to protect their $50m mansion in the hills of Calabasas. It narrowly survived the fire, but critics began wondering if the destruction-fueled \u201cnew normal\u201d meant the affluent, yet again, could save themselves while others suffered.Designer districtsPartisan gerrymandering has been carried out by both Democrats and Republicans throughout U.S. history. But\u00a0an Associated Press statistical analysis\u00a0based on 2016 election data found that more states had Republican-tilted districts than Democratic ones. Some of the largest GOP congressional advantages were in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where Republicans fully controlled redistricting after the 2010 Census. One of the Democrats\u2019 biggest edges was in Maryland, where they were in charge of the last redistricting.A follow-up AP analysis using preliminary 2018 election data shows the Republican statistical edge was cut in half under Pennsylvania\u2019s new court-ordered congressional map but grew even larger in North Carolina.Though an increasing number of states have adopted independent commissions, many states still rely on lawmakers and governors to draw legislative and congressional districts. Republicans controlled that process in far more states than Democrats because of their electoral success nationwide in 2010. Those maps were in place for the Nov. 6 elections, except in places where courts ordered them redrawn, and will be again in 2020.Florida, the jammed paperclip perpetually short circuiting America\u2019s democracyIn one of the most serious cases, Palm Beach County found \u201cdozens of precincts missing a significant number\u201d of votes during the machine recount, according to the supervisor of elections, Susan Bucher, causing the county to conclude that entire boxes of ballots may not have been counted.Ms. Bucher blamed an overheated and outdated ballot-scanning machine. But the manufacturer of the high-speed scanner used in Palm Beach said its technicians had witnessed Palm Beach County elections workers, apparently worried that one of the machines was running too fast, jam a paper clip into the scanner\u2019s \u201center\u201d button in an effort to slow it down. That, in turn, caused a short circuit that cut off the power, a company spokeswoman said.The president who is permanently \u201cat odds\u201d with the conclusions of his nation\u2019s intelligence community (and yes, he has been briefed on this)[T]he CIA [has]\u00a0assessed with high confidence\u00a0that the Saudi leader [Mohammed bin Salman] ordered the killing [of journalist Jamal Khashoggi], based on multiple sources of intelligence.\u00a0\u201cWe haven\u2019t been briefed yet. The CIA will be speaking to me today,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before leaving to survey damage from wildfires in California.\u00a0But the president has already been shown evidence of the prince\u2019s alleged involvement in the killing, and privately he remains skeptical, Trump aides said. He has also looked for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed, the aides said.\u00a0The president\u2019s most recent comments put him at odds with the findings of the CIA and senior intelligence officials.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201dWhen the vote-counting is finished, the GOP may not even have enough lawmakers in California\u2019s 53-member House delegation to field a nine-person softball team.\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d Mike Madrid, a former political director of the California Republican Party, said of the state GOP. \u201cIt exists in small regional pockets, where there are enough white, non-college-educated working-class communities for there to be a Republican Party. But that\u2019s not much.\u201dOther states tilt lopsidedly in favor of one party or the other. But never before has a state with California\u2019s huge populous and enormous import \u2014 socially, culturally, economically \u2014 been so dominated by a single political party. The implications will take years to fully comprehend.Analysis from our own California politics mavenAnd in urban areas and Western states, minorities make up the majority of their generation, according to PewDon\u2019t miss the major political implications of this [Pew study]: 48% of Post-Millennials (now aged 6 to 21) are members of racial or ethnic minorities\u2013far above the 39% in the Millennial generation (which itself was the prior record-holder). They are just starting to join the electorate..The better educated, more diverse generation to comeA new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that the \u201cpost-Millennial\u201d generation is already the most racially and ethnically diverse generation, as a bare majority of 6- to 21-year-olds (52%) are non-Hispanic whites. And while most are still pursuing their K-12 education, the oldest post-Millennials are enrolling in college at a significantly higher rate than Millennials were at a comparable age.The parents of post-Millennials are more well educated than the parents of Millennials and those of previous generations, and this pattern most likely contributes to the relative affluence of the households in which post-Millennials live. \u2026 The high school dropout rate for the oldest post-Millennials (ages 18 to 20 in 2017) is significantly lower than that of similarly aged Millennials in 2002. And among those who were no longer in high school in 2017, 59% were enrolled in college \u2013 higher than the enrollment rate for 18- to 20-year-old Millennials in 2002 (53%) and Gen Xers in 1986 (44%).The changing patterns in educational attainment are driven in part by the shifting origins of young Hispanics. Post-Millennial Hispanics are less likely than Millennial Hispanics to be immigrants \u2013 12% of post-Millennial Hispanics were born outside the U.S., compared with 24% of Millennial Hispanics in 2002. Previous research has shown that second-generation Hispanic youth tend to\u00a0go further in school\u00a0than foreign-born Hispanic youth. That is borne out in this analysis, as 61% of second-generation Hispanics ages 18 to 20 who were no longer in high school were enrolled in college in 2017, compared with 40% of their foreign-born counterparts.The hazardous air quality in northern California is not expected to improve until the middle of next week at the earliestThere have been\u00a0widespread school and university closures. Many businesses have urged employees to work from home.\u00a0Some public transit\u00a0in San Francisco has been made free, in an effort to keep people inside as much as possible if they must commute. In a region whose weather is usually pretty temperate, smoke days have become the Bay Area\u2019s version of snow days. But instead of a joyful respite from work, wildfire smoke mixes a blizzard\u2019s large-scale logistical nightmares with the anxiety of worsening climate change and a class divide that plagues American public health. Three of the five largest fires on record in California\u00a0have occurred\u00a0in the past three years, all in the northern part of the state. For the region\u2019s residents, smoke days won\u2019t go away once the Camp Fire is contained.The risk posed by wildfire smoke is significant, and it goes far beyond a few days of coughing or headaches. According to Kristie Ebie, a professor of global public health at the University of Washington, the consequences of breathing wildfire smoke extend to other parts of the body because of the noxious nature of the tiny debris the smoke carries with it. \u201cThat affects not only people\u2019s lungs, but it gets absorbed into people\u2019s systems,\u201d she says. Recent research\u00a0shows\u00a0that absorption can lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, and other deadly outcomes.With kids home from school, people working from home, and few safe ways to leave the house, Northern Californians are looking for any outlet available to find some relief.The ongoing search for remainsAs many as 7,000 households have been displaced by the Camp fire in Butte County , CaliforniaCamp fire missing persons list now over 1,000, confirmed death toll up to 71Searchers combing through the ruins of the deadliest wildfire in California history found eight more bodies Friday, bringing the number of dead in the Camp Fire to 71 as more than 1,000 people remained unaccounted for.Seven of the eight bodies were found in the town of Paradise, which was all but destroyed in the fire that broke out Nov. 8, and the other was in Magalia, north of Paradise, said Butte County Sheriff-Coroner Kory L. Honea said. All were found inside structures.Honea cautioned that the number of unaccounted for \u2014 1,011 as of Friday night \u2014 could include names that are duplicates or have different spelling variations, and that investigators were working to verify them. \u2026The Camp Fire has displaced thousands of people and led to the evacuation of some 52,000 at the fire\u2019s peak. About 47,200 remained evacuated Friday, officials said. The fire has burned 146,000 acres and was 50 percent contained Friday. \u2026 [It] has destroyed at least 9,700 single-family residences, 144 multi-family residences and 336 commercial buildings, according to Cal Fire."}
