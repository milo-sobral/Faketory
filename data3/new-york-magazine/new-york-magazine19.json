{"id": "The Best Rowing Machines on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy (like pillows), but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try everything. Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2019em) products and single out the most convincing. While we\u2019ve written before about other home exercise equipment, like treadmills, stationary bikes, and ellipticals, here we\u2019ve rounded up the best-reviewed rowing machines on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m picky about my decorating and hate the way workout equipment looks. But the quality and good looks of this rower makes me proud to put it in my bedroom. Friends have commented that it looks like a piece of furniture. Rowing is easy on the joints and gives me a full-body workout. I feel like in the few short weeks I\u2019ve owned it, my body is more toned and I feel stronger. I don\u2019t think anyone would be disappointed in this machine.\u201d\u201cWhat a great machine. My wife and I have never been gym rats; it\u2019s just not how we choose to work out. We have a very decent treadmill, but have never been drawn to using it consistently. This rower is amazing. So effortless to use and still get a great workout. There is something Zen about the sound of the water as you complete each stroke. I\u2019m drawn to work out every day, just for those 30 minutes of solitude.\u201d\u201cUpon receiving the unit, my son and I had it out of the box, set up, and operating in just 15 minutes. Outstanding design. Simply one of the easiest to assemble pieces of exercise equipment I have ever used. What immediately strikes you about it is how well-made it looks and feels. Every piece of this device is best in class. Other rowers just don\u2019t compare. The Concept2 is a Tesla among Yugos when it comes to air-resistance rowers. Everything from the manuals to the box it came in screams quality. You are getting your money\u2019s worth, and that feels good in this day and age.\u201d\u201cThis is an excellent rower, especially at this price point. The Stamina Air Rower definitely gets my heart rate elevated and provides a very good leg workout, so long as you row using the proper technique. The resistance is excellent. There is no damper to control the air flow, but as with all air rowers, you can increase the resistance by rowing harder.\u201d\u201cThis is one of our best choices in fitness equipment and worth every penny spent. Assembly was fast and easy. We thought it might sit too high, but it is actually nice not having to lower yourself all the way to the ground to use the machine. The seat and row bar move smoothly. I can\u2019t think of anything that I don\u2019t like about this equipment. It offers a full-body workout and makes it fun to boot.\u201d\u201cI have been using the Stamina Avari Magnetic Rower for over a month now. I am extremely happy with the product. One thing I think everyone will like is how quiet it is! Since resistance is determined by a magnetic setup, it is crazy quiet. I could be rowing in my bedroom and most likely not wake my wife. I really like the preprogrammed \u2018courses\u2019 \u2014 it offers variety without having to spend a ton of time trying to program it yourself. They also allow for on-the-fly adjustments in difficulty.\u201d\u201cThis is a good, solid rowing machine. I\u2019m amazed that this unit functions very smoothly and quietly \u2014 and it gives a great workout. It feels stable and solid \u2014 not rickety at all. I checked out all of the electronics/counters and resistance controls, and they all function perfectly. The cosmetics are fine, too. I\u2019m pleased with it \u2014 especially at this price, and recommend it to anyone who is looking to get a good cardio workout at home.\u201d\u201cI bought this machine as an affordable addition to my home gym. It came mostly preassembled, and the rest of the assembling was very simple and quick to do. The machine itself is a great workout on my abs and arms on the higher intensity levels. The computer is a neat way to track how many times you\u2019ve rowed, but definitely avoid the calorie portion because it highly overestimates how many calories you\u2019re burning. Overall, it is very useful and a great addition to my gym.\u201d\u201cFor the price, this is a great machine. I row in a regular shell on the local lake in good weather, and use this to keep in practice during the winter. The oars are set up so that they mimic the natural action on the water, which allows me to keep my form in a way that many machines don\u2019t. It also allows for a great range of motion to change up workouts by varying your hold on the oars. Putting it together was a bit of a hassle but not terrible. It\u2019s quiet enough to use while watching TV or holding a conversation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to try a rowing machine for a while now but didn\u2019t want to spend a fortune and needed one that would support my weight. This machine fit the bill on both scores. Assembly was easy,\u00a0and the machine is solid, sturdy, and seems to be very well constructed. It works like a charm, too! I am not an avid exerciser but took to the rowing machine like I\u2019d been out in actual rowboats all my life. The ability to change resistance is a nice feature, and I felt like I got a good workout while using the machine.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
