{"id": "What Jean Pigozzi Can\u2019t Live Without", "paragraph": "If you\u2019re like us, you\u2019ve probably wondered what famous people add to their carts. Not the JAR brooch and Louis XV chair, but the\u00a0hand sanitizer\u00a0and the\u00a0electric toothbrush. We asked designer, photographer, and collector Jean Pigozzi, whose new book Charles and Saatchi is out now, about the camera, ice cream, and beverage he can\u2019t live without.This is the only ice cream that I eat. If I can\u2019t find H\u00e4agen-Dazs coffee ice cream, I\u2019ll abstain, but if I find it, I eat a lot of it. I\u2019m actually not a coffee drinker, but I think they got the taste really right. I like the consistency, too. It\u2019s not too sugary. I think it\u2019s a masterpiece.I\u2019m addicted to UGGs, but I don\u2019t wear them outside. I\u2019ve never been seen in public wearing them, but as soon as it gets cold, I wear them all around the house. They\u2019re not the slippers though. They\u2019re the outdoor shoes that I wear indoors. I have three pairs of the classic ones that go up to the mid-calf.I\u2019ve been wearing these shirts for the last 25 years. I find them incredibly comfortable. They\u2019re the only thing I can sleep in. I actually just bought five more yesterday. I\u2019m always scared they\u2019re going to discontinue them, so I hoard them. They only get better and better after you wash them hundreds of times. I have about 40 of them.I\u2019m glued to it. About 90 percent of what I do is on the iPad Mini. I\u2019ll read the papers, do my emails; I even have my music on it. Sometimes I\u2019ll take photographs, too. Not for my work, but if I\u2019m explaining a chair or a piece of plumbing or something, that\u2019s how I\u2019ll use it. It also fits in the pocket of some of my suits. I like that it\u2019s a bigger screen than the iPhone, and I like the convenience of all my apps, which you don\u2019t have on the laptop. They just came out with a new one, so I\u2019m running to the Apple store to get it.I have never shaved with a blade in my life because this razor is good and fast and does the job.It\u2019s the most modern, new Leica, so the camera\u2019s not too big, but it\u2019s very fast and easy to use. I bring it around everywhere, though I don\u2019t really print out my pictures. Most of them just sit on my computer. When I do a book, I\u2019ll print them out just to see how they\u2019ll look, but otherwise they\u2019re just digital.I can\u2019t start the morning if I haven\u2019t read \u201cPage Six.\u201d It\u2019s hard because in Europe it doesn\u2019t come out until 10 in the morning, and sometimes 10:05 or 10:06. Half the time, I don\u2019t know who the people they\u2019re talking about are. I know Nicki Minaj, but some of the rappers or TV people, I don\u2019t know them at all, but I think it\u2019s fun to know what\u2019s happening in New York, especially if you\u2019re in Europe.This is the smell I like. I was at a Jesuit school when I was young, so it reminds me of church.Pellegrino has the best bubbles. Perrier is too aggressive, but San Pellegrino gets the number of bubbles right. I\u2019ll drink seltzer, too, but I like Pellegrino better. I never take it with lime, though. You don\u2019t want to spoil it.I don\u2019t know if you want this on the list, but it\u2019s like a toothpick with a brush that my dentist recommended for cleaning between your teeth. I highly recommend it. If you get it, get the No. 3, which is the best size. I feel most comfortable with it. I keep one in my back pocket at all times.My dogs Charles and Saatchi are the subject of my new book. Charles is the girl and Saatchi\u2019s a boy. Saatchi\u2019s very energetic, but Charles\u2019s absolutely lazy.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
