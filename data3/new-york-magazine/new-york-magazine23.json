{"id": "The Best Ugly Christmas Sweaters on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try\u00a0everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing. We\u2019ve covered the best\u00a0artificial Christmas trees,\u00a0Christmas tree toppers,\u00a0Christmas lights, and\u00a0wreaths, and now we\u2019re zeroing in on the best ugly Christmas sweaters on Amazon. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cI love Christmas and I love being able show my Christmas spirit in my fashion choices! The sweater is very thick (which is good for when the weather gets colder because I\u2019ve found that a lot of Christmas sweaters that I buy from other stores are very thin and not very warm at all). The styles available are all very cute and stylish. The sweaters are great for ugly sweater parties and are a great way to spread holiday cheer. Overall, it has quickly become one of my favorite sweaters!\u201d\u201cThis is really a very nice sweater. I wanted something cute, and maybe a bit \u2018dorky\u2019 that I could actually wear for Ugly Sweater Days at work over the holiday season, and this fills the bill perfectly. It isn\u2019t too heavy or bulky, but still heavy enough to \u2018take the chill off.\u2019 It seems to be quite well made. I ordered an XL, and it actually fits more like a L. This is fine for me, but if you really need an XL it might be a bit small for you. Over all, I\u2019m quite pleased with this sweater.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hideous\u2013but it\u2019s supposed to be. Big hit at Xmas shows I played. Only reason for losing a star: since the LED\u2019s are motion-sensitive, if it\u2019s hanging on my bedroom clothes rack (aka treadmill), every little breeze in the room (or brush-past by my cat) lights it up in the dark.\u201d\u201cThe pictures don\u2019t really do this sweater justice. It\u2019s really nice quality, thick and warm and the infinity scarf is an added bonus. I wore this to an \u2018ugly sweater\u2019 party, but it\u2019s just too cute to be considered ugly! One thing to note, I\u2019d normally wear an XS but they didn\u2019t offer that size. I opted for the small which fits but is a tad bigger. For someone who normally wears small, this would fit as expected.\u201d\u201cI ordered this sweater as a cheap, fun thing to wear around the holidays. The quality exceeded my expectations for the price since it is thick. The large size, however, was much larger than expected. I\u2019m five-foot-five and 160 pounds and probably should\u2019ve ordered a small. Will still look okay with boots and leggings for an ugly sweater party.\u201d\u201cThis sweater is going to be great for my husband to wear to the family \u2018Ugly Christmas Sweater\u2019 party! He laughed out loud when he saw it. I ordered one size up just in case it shrank in the wash. I turned it inside out and washed it on the gentle cycle in cold water and then dried it on low heat. It may have shrunk just ever so slightly, but it came out of the washer soft and fluffy and the colors didn\u2019t fade any.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely fantastic! I bought this as a tacky Christmas sweater then just never took it off!!! I can simultaneously anger my girlfriend and scare my dog. I didn\u2019t think this was even possible! For any fans of sloths, sweaters, or Christmas in general this is a must have.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely amazing. Nice material. Great design. I\u2019m a bigger guy so I ordered as big as I could, and I REALLY got what I paid for. I usually wear hanes XL T shirts, and this thing will need to shrink just once in the wash and will be perfect. Best $30 I ever spent. I can\u2019t go ANYWHERE without getting compliment.\u201d\u201cGood material and excellent craftsmanship. I needed a sweater for a work function and this is a classic cut and will last for many December\u2019s to come.\u201d\u201cThis is a great holiday sweater, got loads of compliments on it. Quite slim fitting IMO. Relatively soft, fingers crossed that keeps after a wash but frankly at this price you cant expect too much on a rarely worn holiday sweater.\u201d\u201cSo adorable! Needed a Christmas sweater for my son for a Christmas party and this was perfect. The colors are nice, the sweater is not too thick but warm enough. The reindeer design is so cute. We got a lot of comments from this sweater.\u201d\u201cThis sweater is awesome and was the talk of my son\u2019s school. Both of my daughters would wear it the days after he\u2019d worn it. What\u2019s not to love about a llama staring at you on a Christmas sweater?\u201d\u201cPretty true to size. It is so cute and ugly at the same time. My son is in love with it and has worn it so many times. Washes very well.\u201d\u201cBought this for my 10-year-old son for Ugly Sweater Day. I bought a medium. He wears a boys\u2019 size 12. Sometimes I don\u2019t know if I should get him a Medium or a Large. Other shoppers said that this sweater runs large. It does. It is wide. A large would have been much too big. Even though the sweater in our opinion is horrendously ugly (which he LOVES), it is well made. The dinosaurs are constructed of a heavy felt material and are sewn onto the sweater very nicely. If you are looking for a loud and obnoxious sweater, this is it!\u201d\u201cGET THIS SWEATER FOR YOUR KID!!!! This is high-end quality for a fraction of the price. This sweater is well made and lovely. This was a perfect choice for dresses-up holiday gatherings, family photos, and even church! I am so pleased with the look, fit, coziness, and quality in relation to the price! Get it!\u201d\u201cOur granddaughter looks adorable in this sweater! She wore it for her preschool concert\u2013it was perfect.\u201d\u201cGreat quality, perfect thickness. I have purchased a lot of different brand sweaters for my 15-pound Westie and this one fits him the best! A perfect fit in large. He did not want to take it off.\u201d\u201cThis is a great dog sweater. Cuter in person. As others have said, not too thick nor thin. The only problem we have is my short fat dog has thick arms and a broad chest (schnauzer mix). I went with a medium based on the length. I may have to stretch the arms out a bit to make it more comfy for him.\u201d\u201cIt was hilarious to watch my puppy wearing this cute costume. She is such a joy and we had a full dose of happiness during Christmas when we watched her reaction to this shirt. Lighting worked very well.\u201d\u201cSuper cute sweater! High quality - someone put some effort into making this sweater warm and adorable. Only nine bucks! Great deal!! I got my 16-pound terrier a size medium and it fits well. Maybe a little too big on him. Hope that helps!\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
