We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          Finding the perfect holiday gift can be maddening \u2014 is this the color they\u2019d want? Is it something they already have? Is it so last year? \u2014 but really, once you have a sense of a person\u2019s taste, it\u2019s not impossible. This season, we\u2019ll be talking to members of various tribes (we\u2019re calling them the Hard-to-Shop-Fors) to find out exactly what to get that serious home cook, skin-care Redditor, or gamer in your life. Think of it as a window into their brain trust \u2014 or at least a very helpful starting point. We all know people who have an especially hard time sleeping. Maybe they always wake up the in middle of the night, or they\u2019re just reluctant night owls. These people need sleep, and the best gift you could possibly give them is a few extra hours of REM.I spoke with self-identified \u201cinsomniac\u201d Cori DeCicco, who has done a lot her own research into the matter. DeCicco has had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as long as she can remember. \u201cI try to be in bed by 10 p.m.,\u201d says DeCicco. \u201cAnd I usually wake up around 1 or 2 a.m. and eventually fall back asleep.\u201d Regardless of when she gets to bed, DeCicco is up for good between 4 and 6 a.m., so she really needs to make the most of the time she can get. DeCicco walked us through the things she has found helpful, and the items on her wish list.DeCicco went with the URPOWER for the same reasons most people do: \u201cIt was the best-reviewed option on Amazon, and it\u2019s a great price.\u201d She uses it with lavender essential oil to relax.If you\u2019re like DeCicco and buying a diffuser for yourself, you probably will think more about about function and value, but it\u2019s nice to splurge a little on a gift for someone else. The Vitruvi is much more design-minded than your average diffuser, so it feels more like a special gift and less like a small appliance. The matte ceramic cover and organic shape make it stand out from the pack.If you want to give someone the benefits of sleep-inducing aromatherapy but think they would rather not to deal with an electric diffuser, the Bodha Calm Ritual Spray is a great option.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about weighted blankets lately,\u201d says DeCicco. When she wakes up in the middle of the night, it can be hard to fall back asleep. \u201cThere\u2019s an anxiety aspect to it.\u201d She wakes up at 1 or 2 a.m., and then can\u2019t help thinking about everything she has to do the next day. She wants to fall back to sleep right away so she can function in the morning, but of course it\u2019s a self-perpetuating cycle \u2014 worrying about not getting enough sleep makes it harder to sleep. A weighted blanket is at the top of DeCicco\u2019s wish list because she has read that the physical sensation of extra \u201cgravity\u201d can give people something to focus on, encouraging relaxation and eventually \u2014 hopefully \u2014 sleep.Another thing DeCicco wants to try is meditation. \u201cI like the Headspace app,\u201d she says. She especially appreciates that Headspace has some guided meditations specifically designed for sleep. \u201cAnd the guy has a nice, relaxing, therapeutic voice.\u201dWhen DeCicco wakes up late at night, she sometimes will try reading a book to help her relax and fall back to sleep. She uses a red bulb in her bedside lamp because it\u2019s a gentle light, and if she\u2019s with her boyfriend it doesn\u2019t wake him up. \u201cMy roommate actually bought it for Halloween a few years ago and I decided to keep it \u2026 It\u2019s really great. It doesn\u2019t hurt your eyes and it makes your house look like a goth rave.\u201dIf you feel weird about giving someone a red LED bulb, this salt lamp would also be a great addition to a bedside table with its soft amber light.\u00a0We like this fair-trade model.On the other hand, if you want go all-in on the red LED bulb gift, you could try the Philip\u2019s Hue Starter Kit. The best thing about the Hue system is you can customize every bulb in your room or house with the Hue app, so you shift everything to orange or red at night and then to bright white in the morning.This is another great option for reading at night. The Somnilite\u2019s bulbs are specially made to give off a soft orange light, which does not interfere with circadian rhythms (unlike the jarring bright-white light emitted by most book lights).Light disturbance is one of the most common sleep-cycle disruptors, and sleep masks make a much nicer gift than blackout curtains. The Lunya silk sleep mask is 100 percent washable silk, and it comes in a variety of colors.DeCicco buys chopped dried kava root in bulk from a local spot and brews it into a tea at night: \u201cI just add a few spoonfuls to a teapot and then hot water.\u201d She says it can taste pretty bitter and isn\u2019t for everyone, but it helps her relax. She also likes Yogi\u2019s Kava Stress Relief tea.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
