{"id": "The Best Stemless Wine Glasses, According to Restaurant Owners and Frequent Party Hosts", "paragraph": "Stemless wine glasses can be divisive: \u201cI think elitists still believe it is somewhat gauche to carry stemless glasses versus \u2018proper\u2019 wine glasses in a restaurant,\u201d says Zach Jones, wine director at Chicago restaurant Pacific Standard Time. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a silly way to think, but it is true that, at least in a restaurant, stemmed wine glasses are easier to store and transport because they can be hung upside down.\u201d But then, the opposite is true for klutzy people at home with small kitchens: \u201cWhen shelf space is limited, they\u2019re a real lifesaver, without having to deal with giant racks or having to make space for tall glassware,\u201d says Roman Tartakovsky, beverage manager at Hudson\u2019s in New York. Plus, as many experts pointed out: a stemless wine glass works equally well for Aperol spritzs, Sangria, a nightcap of something brown, or even just water. So as a way to praise the stemless wine glass, here are over a dozen wine experts, restaurant owners, beverage directors, and frequent party hosts who\u2019ve chosen their favorites.Austrian glassware company Riedel, which has been around since 1756, is the perennial favorite wine glass, but its \u201cO\u201d series of stemless glasses \u2014 around half of the pros interviewed for this story raved about them \u2014 didn\u2019t come about until 2004. Introduced initially as tumbler glasses, this particular style is technically intended for Cabernet and Merlot red wines. Cedric Nicaise, wine director at Eleven Madison Park, likes these because there are relatively few compromises compared to a traditional stemmed style. \u201cIt still provides great aromatics and the glass is very thin, so smelling and drinking wine are great experiences,\u201d Nicaise says. (Although he warns about using them for cocktails: \u201cthe glass is delicate, so be careful when putting in ice.\u201d)Tartakovsky\u2019s favorite Riedel stemless style is the curvaceous, undulating silhouette of the Swirl, because of its \u201cunique shape for swirling the wine,\u201d he says.Vanessa von Bismarck, co-founder and partner of PR firm BPCM, is a self-described traditionalist when it comes to wine glasses, usually opting for stemmed styles, but she\u2019s also a fan of the wide, ultra-rounded Pinot/Nebbiolo style in the O series. \u201cThe shape and the hand feel is more comforting than the more traditional long-stem wine glass,\u201d she says. Von Bismarck also likes to serve white wine or gin and tonics in stemless glassware when she\u2019s entertaining at home.\u201cWhat makes a great glass is similar to what makes a great wine: you like how it feels; for a wine, when drinking it, for a glass, when it\u2019s in your hand,\u201d explains Andrew Bell, wine director and sommelier at Playboy Club New York, who likes Riedel but also recommends the Aero style from Luigi Bormioli. \u201cThere is the weight of the bowl, and how the glass or crystal feels when you drink; the key in high-end glassware is the provenance of the sand, and the purer the sand, the greater the opportunity for the glass to be flawless.\u201dVictoria James, beverage director at New York Korean steakhouse Cote, suggests this sturdy style for at-home drinking, saying they feel French. \u201cThis tumbler brings me back to brasseries and vineyards in France, where these are used for a simple casse-cro\u00fbte,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thickness of the glass allows you to grip it and not heat up the wine too much, which is an issue with thin, stemless tumblers; they are dishwasher safe, stackable, and last forever,\u201d James says. She says to use these for a casual Tuesday-night bottle: \u201cThey\u2019re meant to be used for everyday, glou-glou wine, something that you would gulp alongside a sandwich.\u201dOr, opt for a slightly more squat style. \u201cThis glass is classic and elegant, while still looking modern, and it feels comfortable in your hand,\u201d says Thom Neil, beverage director at Ribbon Midtown, opening this fall. Neil discovered the style while researching glassware and \u201cspotted a brand I didn\u2019t know made glasses, which piqued my interest,\u201d he says. \u201cThe glass fits the hand nicely, with a very balanced weight, and they are sturdy enough to handle a dishwasher.\u201dThese angular glasses, intended for wine or cocktails, won\u2019t chip or break, and have a nice, thick base. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a big fan of Schott Zwiesel\u2019s products: They\u2019re not the most inexpensive wine glasses out there, but they\u2019re aesthetically beautiful, functional, and generally more durable than their closest competitors,\u201d Jones says. Although there are different versions available for red or white wine, Jones suggests using these for any grape. \u201cIt\u2019s wide enough at the base to be considered proper for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, but the overall shape is sleek and vertical, like a Bordeaux glass, so it\u2019s perfectly suitable for Sauvignon Blanc or rich reds like Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel.\u201dYvette Leeper-Bueno, owner of Harlem restaurant Vinateria, only uses stemmed glasses at the restaurant, but loves these short bodega-style glasses for at-home drinking. \u201cWhen I was traveling in Spain I saw them everywhere in Barcelona,\u201d she says. \u201cThe culture of drinking there is so casual and fun,\u201d which goes with the informality of these flat-bottomed glasses. They\u2019re not technically perfect for wine, as they don\u2019t let it breathe. \u201cSo anything too special might not be a good fit for these glasses,\u201d Leeper-Bueno says. \u201cBut they are easy to hold, stackable, and super to easy to throw in the dishwasher; they are just casual and fun,\u201d Leeper-Bueno says. [Editor\u2019s note: These are also one size smaller than the favorite of our own deputy editor Jason Chen, who likes the slightly larger ones for wine, too.]Pottery Barn also stocks a bodega glass, which Ariel Arce, owner and restaurateur of Air\u2019s Champagne Parlor and Tokyo Record Bar, likes for the short, stout shape, \u201cso you can\u2019t knock them over,\u201d she says.Arce was tipped off to the beauty of the bodega glass by friends who went to Spain and started drinking txakolina, the sparkling white wine that comes from the Basque region. \u201cThey had a dinner party where they served wine in these glasses, and I fell in love.\u201dYes, there are stem-free ways to drink bubbles that aren\u2019t a traditional flute, like this clever inverse design from MoMA. Eric Smith, co-owner of Baltimore\u2019s Atlas Restaurant Group, keeps a couple of these in his bar cart at home. While drinking whites or sparkling wines out of most stemless glassware presents the problem of warming the drink with your body heat when sipping, that\u2019s not an issue here: \u201cThese solve that problem in an innovative, visually stunning way that doesn\u2019t compromise the sparkling liquid within,\u201d he says. He also says that they\u2019re delicate and not easy to clean, so, they don\u2019t exactly go in the dishwasher.Govino is \u201cthe only stemless \u2018glass\u2019 I tend to use,\u201d says Steven Grubbs, wine director at Atlanta restaurants Empire State South and Five & Ten, who uses them for \u201ccasual, rugged, and outdoor portable drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe if you\u2019re in a scenario where stems are too precious or dainty, then actual glass is probably a liability there, too; enter good, smart, effective plastic wine cups.\u201d Thomas Pastuszak, wine director at the NoMad (and founder of Empire Estate, a winery in the Finger Lakes region) uses the 12-ounce ones too: \u201cIt\u2019s a super-versatile size, great for sparkling, white, or red wine, and it also nicely fits cocktails on ice, too, like an Aperol spritz,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a really convenient dimple on the bottom and side of the glass, for an even more stable grip.\u201dAndy Maturana, chef and owner of RAPT, an NYC-based catering company, goes through approximately 3,000 Govino stemless styles at his company\u2019s events each year; he likes the slightly larger 16-ounce versions.\u201cThese glasses are pretty and are a no-brainer: They can\u2019t break, and look nice on the table,\u201d says Arce. Her earliest encounters with indestructible drinkware is quite relatable: \u201cPlastic glassware was a big thing in college; you didn\u2019t have to worry about breaking anything.\u201d These days, she likes using them for outdoor parties.Philanthropist Jean Shafiroff frequently hosts dinner parties (in addition to many charity galas), and when entertaining at home, she opts for glassware that looks as fancy as possible. \u201cI love Saint Louis wine glasses; they make whatever you are drinking look expensive,\u201d she says. This handcrafted crystal tumbler is from the French brand that dates back to the 16th century.Or, there\u2019s this more modern, clean-edged version that\u2019s just slightly more affordable.Another work of art masquerading as a stemless wine glass: this gorgeous, hand-blown Murano glass style, which Jenny Vorhoff, of design studio Studio Riga, uses at home. \u201cI have a few sets of six in various colors, and they look even more chic and collected when mixed together,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are actually quite sturdy and feel heavy in the hand, like crystal,\u201d Vorhoff says. Using stemless wine glasses has a subtle but important purpose when entertaining at home, as it \u201ctells my guests that dinner is going to be relaxed, and relaxed dinners are the most fun.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
