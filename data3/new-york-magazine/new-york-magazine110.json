We\u2019re talking to experts and testing products ourselves to get those precious eight hours a night.\n                          It wasn\u2019t long into my first brush with Korean beauty that I became infatuated with sleeping packs (also known as sleeping masks). They have a funny name, but they\u2019re basically overnight masks that you apply as the final step in your evening skincare routine (after moisturizer), which give you an extra boost of moisture and treatment. They\u2019re a bit heavy for nightly use, but they\u2019re great to use about once a week (much like a regular face mask), before a special occasion, or when your skin is going through a rough patch and could use some extra care.I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cReally? Another step to my skincare routine?\u201d But it\u2019s quick to throw on, and I\u2019m always thrilled with how plump and bright my skin looks after I\u2019ve used one. Here\u2019s a secret: sometimes when I come home super late and can\u2019t be bothered to do my whole routine, I\u2019ll wash my face and slap on a sleeping pack and call it a night \u2014 and to be honest, I\u2019m usually really happy with how my skin looks when I wake up. Below, a few of my all-time favorite sleeping masks for all different kinds of skin issues, so you can wake up looking well-rested and hydrated this winter.This mask actually doesn\u2019t contain any honey, but it does include propolis, a residue that honeybees use to fill and seal the crevices of their honeycombs. That might sound odd, but there\u2019s tons of K-beauty brands that claim propolis as a holy grail ingredient in their products. And here\u2019s why: research suggests that propolis is antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral, which means it\u2019s the perfect ingredient for regenerating skin, softening, and smoothing. That\u2019s the case with this wonder of a sleeping pack from Cosrx \u2014 when I use it, I wake up with skin that\u2019s noticeably more glowing, brighter, and softer. When I\u2019m trying to bring my skin back from the brink after a series of gnarly breakouts, this mask, which I put on after I throw on my moisturizer, is a true lifesaver at combatting the damage I\u2019ve done, while also hydrating and plumping my skin. It\u2019s the boost I need, especially during my time of the month.In my opinion, Huxley\u2019s Sahara Sleeping Mask is a fall essential. When it comes to shifting seasons, soothing and hydrating your skin is a must. This sleep mask does exactly that, because it includes prickly pear cactus extract, an ingredient full of antioxidants that are beneficial to your skin, as well as hyaluronic acid for hydrating, and centella asiatica for soothing. This isn\u2019t the mask I reach for when I\u2019m combatting active breakouts (see above) but this has never, ever made me break out, and its soothing benefits have helped me get rid of some gross scabby situations before. While the results are deeply moisturizing, the texture actually feels quite gel-like, so if a thick, creamy sleeping mask sounds like a nightmare to you, this one is your match. This will sink into your skin quite quickly.Who doesn\u2019t want to get a little boost of hydration that also happens to have some anti-aging benefits? This vegan, organic, lightweight mask is formulated with oligopeptides to re-texturize and buff out any fine lines and wrinkles, leaving your skin looking super plump and radiant. It also uses hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and snail extract for skin renewal. This is perfect for those who are less concerned with acne, and more concerned with rewinding the clock.When I had the pleasure of interviewing Jude Chao, she told me that it was criminal I hadn\u2019t tried this mask. It\u2019s certainly not cheap, but after one use I understood the hype. It totally wakes your skin up \u2014 not only does it appear softer and nourished, it just makes your skin look super bright and alive. I love a lot of the Sulwhasoo products, but this one was a real game changer for me. With an ingredient list that features scutellaria root, walnut extract, and angelica acutiloba,\u00a0it gives your skin extra nourishment, and nurtures it while you sleep.The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
