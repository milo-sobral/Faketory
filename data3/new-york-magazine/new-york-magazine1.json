{"id": "The Best Milk Frothers on Amazon, According to Hyperenthusiastic Reviewers", "paragraph": "Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t try\u00a0everything. Which is why we have\u00a0People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that\u2019s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of \u2018em) products and single out the most convincing. And while we\u2019ve written extensively about nearly everything you need to make caf\u00e9-quality at home, including coffee makers, espresso machines, coffee grinders, even gifts for coffee lovers, here, we\u2019re going deep on the best milk frothers, so you can make cappuccinos and lattes at home, according to the people. (Note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity.)\u201cGreat product. We just returned home from a family vacation in Spain and Italy and really missed the great\u00a0morning\u00a0coffees we had in Europe. I wanted to re-create these frothy coffees, so I found this milk frother on Amazon and purchased as a result of all the positive reviews. Could not be happier. We are now enjoying the same quality coffees that we learned to\u00a0love\u00a0in Europe. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for an\u00a0easy\u00a0way of frothing milk for coffee without spending a lot of money for a high-end cappuccino or espresso machine.\u201d\u201cI\u00a0love\u00a0this milk frother! It is compact, efficient and\u00a0easy\u00a0to clean up. I purchased the black one because it matches my kitchen appliances, so it fits just right with the color scheme. I like to keep my counter uncluttered, and this is the perfect size, and the stand makes it\u00a0easy\u00a0to use, clean, and store. Perfect for a small kitchen or limited space. It is battery-operated, so there are no unsightly cords to deal with. It turns my\u00a0morning\u00a0coffee into a real treat, and it is saving me money in\u00a0lattes\u00a0at the local coffeehouse. I have only had it for a week, and it has paid for itself in savings. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t buy one sooner!\u201d\u201cThis has been a pretty cool tool to have for an avid latte drinker. I love that it has a one-button start-up feature that does everything, especially when I\u2019m a zombie in the morning just wanting my coffee fix. It has two different attachments: one for\u00a0frothing\u00a0and one for just heating. When one is not in use, the other conveniently fits into the lid for storage. It\u2019s extremely easy to use. I let it do its thing, and by the time my single-cup coffee maker (Keurig) is done, the\u00a0warm,\u00a0frothy\u00a0milk\u00a0is already waiting. It doesn\u2019t burn the\u00a0milk\u00a0and leaves it at the perfect temperature. Very easy to clean \u2026 Overall, great product that looks beautiful with my stainless-steel kitchen appliances!\u201d\u201cThis frother is terrific. It produces hot, dense foam in no time at all. It\u2019s so quiet that, at first, I would look through the clear lid to make sure it was working. It\u2019s very simple to use \u2014\u00a0you just push the\u00a0button\u00a0on the front. It takes up very little space on the countertop and is very easy to clean. I love it!\u201d\u201cThis thing is awesome! I love freshly frothed\u00a0milk. I put the milk in the glass, pop it in the\u00a0microwave\u00a0for about one minute, and then, I pull it out and vigorously\u00a0froth\u00a0it for about 30 seconds and pour the perfectly frothed milk into my coffee. I think it works better than any of the machine frothers out there. You just don\u2019t want to overheat the milk, or it won\u2019t\u00a0froth\u00a0up. Easy to use and easy to clean.\u201d\u201cWe have enjoyed the most amazing cappuccinos, lattes, and everything in between for over four years now with this amazing manual\u00a0milk\u00a0frother. I am from Italy and was never happy with the battery-operated milk frothers I had used over my 20 years in the United States. I\u00a0love\u00a0how versatile this\u00a0frother\u00a0is: Depending on how many times you pump the metal mesh, your foam gets thicker, leaving it up to you to choose the type of drink you want to create. I bought an extra one for my best friend this past Christmas, and I am now spreading cappuccino\u00a0love\u00a0all around my town!\u201d\u201cAmazing coffee machine. I was skeptical at first about the machine, but I actually really love it. The\u00a0milk\u00a0reservoir prevents waste of unused steamed milk; it is super easy to attach and detach. I also love the different settings for espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Another thing I love is that if my kids want hot cocoa, I can easily just\u00a0steam\u00a0them\u00a0milk\u00a0to have a coffeehouse-style hot cocoa, way better than just making it with hot water. The machine is a little loud, but I don\u2019t mind at all because I know that it is making an amazing cup of coffee. It heats up fast, which is also great, since some mornings I am running out the door in a hurry and don\u2019t have a bunch of time to wait while the machine heats up.\u201dThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
