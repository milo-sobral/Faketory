To score the first goal and come out of the first period with a lead is great because you can see in the dressing room the guys are a little more encouraged by it.\"Jonas Brodin made it 2-0 at 14:22 of the second period on a wrist shot from the left circle with Kings goalie Jack Campbell (22 saves) screened.Video: LAK@MIN: Brodin wires wrist shot past Campbell\"It's just tough,\" Campbell said. \"We expect to win here. [The Kings aren't] just any other team where maybe they've been through this before. This is a winning team and we expect to be winners and expect to contend for Stanley Cups. This is real frustrating. We have the leaders in our locker room, whether they have a letter on their jersey or not, they're so many guys in this room that, personally, I look up to.\u00a0\"Just keep the boots moving and keep working every day. I think that's what everybody is trying to do.\"Clifford picked up the puck after a turnover by Nick Seeler and scored from the right face-off circle to pull Los Angeles within 2-1 at 3:39 of the third period.Video: LAK@MIN: Clifford steals puck and scoresMikael Granlund scored a shorthanded empty-net goal with 45 seconds remaining to make it 3-1, and Mikko Koivu scored into an empty net with 24 seconds left for the 4-1 final.\u00a0Minnesota killed off three penalties in the final 7:28.\u00a0\"I thought [the Kings] were a team that didn't have a lot of confidence, which is why I was worried when they made it 2-1 because then they could sit there and my thought was 'Oh, OK, we're right here. Let's go,'\" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"But we were lucky enough to kill three penalties after that, so that was good.\"\u00a0\"Losing in this game is not enjoyable. \u2026 At the end of the day, results are two points, [whether] you do good things or don't do good things. I thought the guys played hard tonight but we need more execution in what we're doing. We're in this business to win. And when you don't win, it's not fun.\" -- Kings coach John Stevens\"I was just telling [my teammates], I said, 'I might call in sick on Saturday so we don't have to do that (pregame celebration) just to get it over with. Hopefully after Saturday it'll be done.\" -- Wild defenseman Ryan Suter on being recognized for playing his 1,000th NHL game Thursday\u00a0\u00a0The Kings have been outscored 29-8 during their losing streak. \u2026 Los Angeles last lost six straight Jan. 4-19. ...
