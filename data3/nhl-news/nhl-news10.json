I liked, we had a push there mid second period. We started to really skate and pressure the puck, and I thought we were a little bit better in our own end, which helped us to create a little more.\"Colliton, at 33 the youngest coach in the NHL, was promoted from Rockford in the American Hockey League.\"We were skating and had some zone time and were able to generate some energy,\" he said. \"Of course we scored, but it looked like we had some push back, which was nice to see, and we carried that over into the third. We had our chances, we had our pressure moments, and we scored the third goal. It looked like we were close to really turning the game.\"\u00a0[WATCH: All Hurricanes vs. Blackhawks highlights]\u00a0Chicago (6-7-3), which trailed 4-0, has lost six straight games.

We've played with the same guy for 10 years, so obviously any type of change is going to be different, but I thought for his first game he was very calm and seemed like he had a powerful message there in the first and second, just to clean up some things and have a better response, but any time you play for a new coach there's going to be a few differences here and there. But as far as judging a coach, I thought he was a good presence behind the bench.\" -- Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane on Jeremy Colliton\u00a0Blackhawks forward Marcus Kruger did not return for the third period after injuring his left leg.
