He was scratched when Pittsburgh lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 at PPG Paints Arena on Thursday.Sullivan did not disclose when Crosby was injured but confirmed he does not have a concussion. Crosby had two assists in 21:32 of ice time in a 4-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday. He did not practice Wednesday, when he was evaluated for the injury.\"We're going to have to do it by committee at this point,\" Sullivan said. \"We've got a couple of our centers (also Derick Brassard) that are out. It's going to be a great opportunity for others to step up and play a more significant role, more significant minutes. So guys have to take advantage of that opportunity. So we believe we have capable people in the lineup, and we just have to make sure that everyone steps up and brings their best game.\"Video: The crew discusses Sidney Crosby's upper-body injuryCrosby has 19 points (eight goals, 11 assists) in 16 games this season.The Penguins have lost seven of their past eight games following a four-game winning streak from Oct. 18-27. Their game against the Lightning was the first of four they play in the next week.\"We've got to find some consistency in our game,\" Sullivan said Wednesday. \"If you don't, then change is inevitable. That's just the reality of our business. We're trying to push this team in the right direction to play the game the right way, to play a certain way that gives us the best chance to win. We've done it at times through this early part of the season, but not nearly consistently enough to get the results.\"\n                    The NHL uses cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
