I still believe we can,\" Rutherford said. \"Whether we can come out and do it this year, or whether we have to make some changes and do it next year, I still believe we have a window here. We're going to start making changes to this team here. ... We're going to make some changes and hopefully get it on track.\"Video: Hall records four points in Devils' 4-2 win vs. PensDuring a radio interview with 105.9 FM in Pittsburgh on Nov. 7, Rutherford expressed disappointment before the Penguins lost a fifth straight game that day. He said some players were too reliant on forwards Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Phil Kessel, and defenseman Kris Letang, who are 31 or older. He also described the goaltending as inconsistent and said Pittsburgh seemed to lack urgency.Rutherford didn't change that narrative Wednesday but did say he doesn't feel the Penguins, who won the Stanley Cup in 2016 and 2017, have bottomed out.\"As bad as we feel right now as to where the Penguins are right now and how we're playing, I don't think we're at that point,\" Rutherford said. \"Certainly over the next couple of months, I'll watch the situation a lot closer to see where we are.\"President and chief executive officer David Morehouse said he was confident Rutherford would do what's necessary.\"We're in a little bit of a downturn, but we're not panicked over it,\" Morehouse said. \"He's going to do what he needs to do to make the team better. That's his job.\"Video: ARI@PIT: Crosby beats Kuemper with sweet backhandHagelin won the Stanley Cup twice with the Penguins after being acquired from the Anaheim Ducks in a trade for David Perron and Adam Clendening on Jan. 16, 2016. Hagelin played mostly second-line left wing with Malkin at center this season and had three points (one goal, two assists) in 16 games.\"At some point in time, we'll have to make some tough decisions on some good players that are the favorites,\" Rutherford said. \"Obviously, most of our players are favorites because when you win a championship, that's what happens. And turn those players into younger players.\"Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said he hopes this trade and any in the future light a fire under his players.\"I think it should be a wakeup call to all of us that we've got to find some consistency in our game,\" Sullivan said. \"Part of the burden of responsibility when you have success is the expectations are extremely high. No one has higher expectations than the people in this dressing room.\"Hagelin was popular within the locker room, Rutherford said. He went on to say he was sure Hagelin's departure would affect the chemistry, which might be for the best.\"I'm not sure how strong the chemistry is right now based on what I'm seeing,\" Rutherford said.Asked if chemistry has been a concern, Letang said the outcomes speak for themselves.\"I don't think we're playing the way we want right now,\" Letang said. \"I don't think we're happy about the results. I think [trades] happen in those circumstances. ... When you're not getting the results, clearly there's a problem. The [general manager] and the coach have certain jobs to do. That's what they try to do. They try to spark things up and try to get us on the right track.\"Letang's review of the Penguins seemed to mirror Rutherford's. But despite his critiques, Rutherford said he expects Pittsburgh to succeed.\"I just think we're in a funk now,\" Rutherford said. \"We're a fragile team. We're struggling. But for the most part, I still believe in this team.\"\n                    The NHL uses cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
