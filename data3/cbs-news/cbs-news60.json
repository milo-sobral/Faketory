Tallahassee police have identified Beierle as the 40-year-old man who entered the Hot Yoga Tallahassee during a Friday night class and started shooting, killing two and wounding six. Police said Beierle then turned the gun on himself but have offered no motive in the attack.Quick said Beierle was able to grab the gun back and then pistol-whip him. \"I jumped up as quickly as I could,\" said Quick, who had visible injuries on his face. \"I ran back over and the next thing I know I'm grabbing a broom, the only thing I can, and I hit him again.\"It created a window of opportunity for some people in the studio time to flee. \"Thanks to him I was able to rush out the door,\" Daniela Garcia Albalat told \"Good Morning America.\" She was in the class and thought she was going to die when the shooting broke out. \"He saved my life.\"Two women \u2014 a 61-year-old faculty member at Florida State University and a 21-year-old FSU student from Atlanta who was due to graduate in May \u2014 were fatally shot.Dr. Nancy Van Vessem was an internist who also served as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, the area's leading health maintenance organization.
