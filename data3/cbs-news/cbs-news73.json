I-- I-- I do think Congressman O'Rourke has his eyes set on Iowa and New Hampshire. He--JON WERTHEIM: You?TED CRUZ: --all-- all-- clearly lookin' forward to that. Now, but listen, I'm-- I'm-- you know-- you know, that-- that there's the old line about glass houses. So I've-- I've run for Senate and then run for president. And I-- you know, if he wants to do that, that's-- he can do that.\u00a0JON WERTHEIM: We've heard a lotta people speculate that you and Sen.
