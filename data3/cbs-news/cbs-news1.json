Three years ago, at age 39, Maribel Ramos was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. The type was triple negative.\"I was angry and sad,\" Ramos said. \"Because I know that the triple negative is a type of cancer that is really hard to treat.\"Ten to 20 percent of breast cancers are called triple negative because they don't have receptors \u2013 such as ones for estrogen \u2013 that can be targeted by certain medications. Treatment options are limited, and these cancers tend to be more aggressive, with worse outcomes. \u00a0 In 2016, Ramos entered a trial to test the immunotherapy drug Tecentriq on patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer.\u00a0Maribel Ramos.The drug works by targeting proteins found on immune cells and some cancer cells.
