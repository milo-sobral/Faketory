In the second trial, the time to symptom relief was the same for patients who took Xofluza as those who took the other antiviral flu treatment, according to the FDA.The most common side effects in patients taking Xofluza were diarrhea and bronchitis.According to Dr. Debra Birnkrant, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's division of antiviral products, \"Having more treatment options that work in different ways to attack the virus is important because flu viruses can become resistant to antiviral drugs.\"Still, Gottlieb noted, \"while there are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs to treat flu, they're not a substitute for yearly vaccination.\"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting a flu shot before the end of October.\nPet health care bills can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars as new technologies and treatments drive up costs\nIf you're having a hard time shedding pounds, try adjusting these common eating habitsCopyright \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.All rights reserved."}
