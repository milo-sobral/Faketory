The \"We the People\" rally was scheduled to start late morning and take place at Philadelphia's Independence Mall through the early afternoon.The event's Facebook page describes it as a rally for the \"silent majority,\" comprised of \"Patriots, Militia, 3%, constitution loving Americans, pro good cop, pro ICE, pro law and order, pro life, pro American value, pro gun and anti illegal immigration.\" The event description adds, \"ITS [sic] TIME TO SHOW PHILLY WHAT PATRIOTISM REALLY IS!!\"Although the Facebook page said that \"any violence, racism, or display of hate by any group or individual is extremely prohibited,\" some are concerned that the rally could turn violent if any violent right-wing groups show up. The Proud Boys, an all-men white nationalist group whose members often attend white supremacist rallies such as the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville in 2017, may make an appearance at the rally.Protestors gather on Independence Mall in Philadelphia on November 17, 2018.\u00a0A few counter-protests have been organized, including one by the progressive PushBack Campaign.
