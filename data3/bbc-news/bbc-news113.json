The 33-year-old has not retired from the international game but is taking a break following the summer's World Cup in Russia and his move from Real Madrid to Juve.His country missed him in Milan. Even with creative players such as Bernardo Silva, Ruben Neves and Andre Silva in the side, they failed to pose a significant threat to the hosts, particularly during a limp first half.Home keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made just one significant save - albeit a brilliant one - from a long-range William Carvalho shot during an improved second-half showing from the visitors.One factor that contributed to Portugal's lack of attacking edge was home defender Giorgio Chiellini, winning his 100th cap, making him the seventh Italian player to reach the milestone.Captaining the team, he was typically excellent in his reading of the game and defensive duties - summed up by a superb tackle to block a shot from Bruma early in the game.Unfortunately for the home side, they were found lacking at the other end of the pitch.Ciro Immobile set the tone, side-footing over from close range after Rui Patricio had palmed out Lorenzo Insigne's long-range shot.Other chances fell to Alessandro Florenzi, Leonardo Bonucci and Federico Chiesa but each contrived a way to miss the target and their belief in getting a positive result waned during a more predictable second half.The only consolation for the Italians is that they have done enough over their four games to retain a place in the top tier of the Nations League.Match ends, Italy 0, Portugal 0.Second Half ends, Italy 0, Portugal 0.Attempt missed.
