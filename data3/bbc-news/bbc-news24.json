Dr Owen Peters, a lecturer and one of the researchers, said the flies can help us understand brain function.\"Flies allow us to do imaging techniques which we aren't able to do in other model systems,\" he said. \"If we find a gene in the human genetic studies that looks like it's linked to Alzheimer's disease - and flies have it - it allows us to have a very rapid, inexpensive system, which we can test to see how these affect brain function.\" Fruit flies are just a small part of the genetic research which is looking to understand better how a family of diseases, which also includes  Parkinson's and Huntingdon's, behave. We know now that what we thought of as brain-rot - a slow decay of the brain in people with dementia - isn't that at allGenetic studies have suggested that the body's own defence system could contribute to Alzheimer's disease. In normal circumstances - for example when a baby's brain is developing -  the body's own response serves an important purpose -  helping to \"prune\" the brain  of \"rubbish\" and get rid of \"redundant\" tissue that's damaged or died.However it's thought in diseases like Alzheimer's that response somehow could be damaging healthy cellsPaul Morgan, professor of immunology, will be trying to try to develop a better understanding about those mechanisms\"We know now what we thought of as brain-rot, a slow decay of the brain in people with dementia - isn't that at all. Instead it's an inflammatory disease where the inflammation is driving the destruction of brain cells,\" said Prof Morgan. \"And knowing that give us new approaches to therapy because were good at treating inflammation in other diseases like arthritis and we can now start thinking of applying those approaches to brain diseases like Alzheimer's.\" Prof Julie Williams, associate director of the institute, said with a team of more than 70 scientists in Cardiff and collaboration within the network, she believes it marks a \"step change\" in the way this set of diseases is studied.\"There are thousands of genes which will affect our susceptibility to develop these diseases so we can now capture most of that information so can indentify people who will be at a very high risk of developing the disease in the future,\" said Prof Williams. \"That will allow us by using samples to create cell models - mini-brains based on stem cells which we can grow and to mould into different tissues - so we can model the disease in a way we've not been able to do in the past.\"The Welsh Government is funding a \u00a31m robotic microscope - made in Llantrisant - which is able to scan and analyse thousands of individual cells at high speed. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething, officially opening the institute, said the investment \"demonstrates our commitment to tackling this devastating disease and forms part of our plan to make Wales a dementia-friendly nation, as set out in our Dementia Action Plan.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesFormer Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab criticises the \"lack of will and resolve\" in dealing with the EU.What are the differences between the two?"}
