He was born in Ghana but left when he was four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes had said that all foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment are subject to automatic deportation, unless there are compelling reasons for them to remain.Since he was detained on 3 September, more than 74,000 people have signed a petition against Adoboli's deportation, with more than 130 members of the UK and Scottish parliaments signing a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid asking him to intervene.Adoboli was found guilty for booking fictitious trades to cover up big losses during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2011. He pleaded not guilty, saying his senior managers knew what he was doing and encouraged him to take risks.Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab criticises the \"lack of will and resolve\" in dealing with the EU.What are the differences between the two?"}
