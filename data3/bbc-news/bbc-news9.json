The Blaenau Gwent Film Academy's first production - Knight of the Blood Moon - has just been finished after costing \u00a310,000 and taking local youngsters five months to write, film and edit.Tutor Kevin Phillips called it a \"blood splattering feast\", adding: \"Likable characters will have you rooting for their survival in this blood bath of mayhem.\"With no escape, a monster with no remorse, no pity, and a craving for blood is upon them, a vicious game of cat and mouse begins.\"It will have its premiere in Tredegar's Little Theatre over Halloween while it has been entered in a number of film festivals.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sitesFormer Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab criticises the \"lack of will and resolve\" in dealing with the EU.What are the differences between the two?"}
