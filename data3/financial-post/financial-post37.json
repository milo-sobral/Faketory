{"id": "NEB\u2019s latest Trans Mountain pipeline review just as flawed as the first one, First Nations, environment groups sayEnergyTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 23, 20184:10 PM EDTLast UpdatedOctober 24, 20183:10 PM EDTThe National Energy Board is repeating its mistakes with a new review of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, laying the groundwork for another court challenge, say First Nations, environmental advocates and politicians in British Columbia.The new review of the project\u2019s impacts on the marine environment is too rushed and limited and the federal government must urgently step in to expand the scope, said Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs Grand Chief Stewart Phillip.\u201cI find it absolutely amazing that the prime minister is without conscience, without any sense of responsibility to the citizens of this country and future generations,\u201d he said at a news conference Tuesday.The Federal Court of Appeal quashed the government\u2019s approval of the project in August, citing the energy board\u2019s failure to examine impacts on the ocean ecosystem, including B.C.\u2019s endangered southern resident killer whales. It also found Canada failed to meaningfully consult with First Nations during the final phase of discussions.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government, which purchased the pipeline and expansion project for $4.5 billion, ordered the energy board to review the project\u2019s marine shipping effects within 155 days and issue a report no later than Feb. 22.The board limited the review\u2019s geographic scope to 12 nautical miles off the B.C. coast. But whales inhabit waters well beyond that area, so the scope should be 200 nautical miles, said Eugene Kung, a lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law.\u201cThey\u2019re continuing to ignore key issues like climate, like project economics and instead importing wholesale the stale evidence from the last time around,\u201d he said.The court ruling in August followed a lengthy legal battle waged by First Nations, environmental groups and Metro Vancouver cities. On Tuesday, several of the same parties said the new process appeared headed toward another court challenge.Kung said any challenges would likely be filed after the energy board publishes its report in February, as any legal cases filed now could be tossed out for being filed too soon.Phillip said he\u2019s firmly opposed to the project and there is no review process that could satisfy him.\u201cThis project has always been a real stinker from the very beginning,\u201d he said, adding that climate change has contributed to worse wildfires and flooding that disproportionately affect First Nations.Vancouver\u2019s new mayor, Kennedy Stewart, was scheduled to appear at the news conference but organizers said his busy schedule prevented him from showing up. Stewart, a former New Democrat MP, was arrested protesting the project earlier this year.\u201cI just want to remind the prime minister that people who opposed this pipeline are being elected,\u201d said Jean Swanson, a newly elected Vancouver councillor.Green Leader Elizabeth May, who was arrested alongside Stewart, noted a recent United Nations report found a temperature increase of only 1.5 C will have catastrophic impacts.\u201cWe have a very troublesome (energy board) process with the same flawed mindset, but in a new context, a context in which we can no longer pretend that you can \u2026 dig a hole and get out of it at the same time,\u201d she said.She described the energy board as \u201cmanifestly incompetent\u201d to do environmental assessments.Energy board spokesman James Stevenson said the board has been conducting such assessments since the mid-1990s and has experienced, expert technical staff.The board sought comments on whether the review should extend to Canada\u2019s territorial sea limit of 12 nautical miles or to Canada\u2019s exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles, and it decided in favour of the former \u201con a principled basis,\u201d he said.The focus of the review is to apply the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the Species at Risk Act to project-related marine shipping, he said, adding the board is confident it can complete a thorough review within 155 days.Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi has met and spoken with First Nations and Metis leaders and will continue to engage with Indigenous communities, said press secretary Vanessa Adams.\u201cThe Federal Court of Appeal was clear that our government needed to do a better job consulting Indigenous peoples and to take into account the impact of marine shipping, and that is exactly what we are doing,\u201d she said.Calculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
