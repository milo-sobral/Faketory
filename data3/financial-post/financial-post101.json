It\u2019s a much smaller number of jobs with fewer economic benefits, and, more importantly, the value created through intellectual property flows out of the country.\u201cOur FDI approaches have been the same for the intangibles, where, when you bring these companies in, they put a half a dozen people in a lab, they poach the best talent and they poach the IP, and then you lose all the wealth effects,\u201d Balsillie said.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I believe in open economies. They\u2019re going to come here anyway; I just don\u2019t know why we give them the best talent, give them our IP, give them tax credits for the research, give them the red carpet for government relations, don\u2019t allow them to pay taxes, and then have all the wealth flow out of the country.\u201dWhen Carmichael asked about the recent push for tax cuts in Canada to match those enacted by U.S. President Donald Trump, Balsillie suggested that the bigger story is how the U.S. is entrenching its advantage on digital trade.\u201cWe had lower taxes than the U.S. for 15 years, and our productivity went down, tick, tick, tick, for 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what the U.S. has said is that you\u2019ve got a one-time holiday to repatriate all your cash, but from now on all your IP gets taxed in the U.S. so they\u2019re accruing the economic benefits and state power that comes with building those intangible assets.\u201dI think they confuse a cheap jobs strategy \u2026 (and) foreign branch plant pennies with innovation billionsWhile Balsillie said that for years Ottawa didn\u2019t listen as he sounded the alarm on intellectual property issues, he said he is now getting feedback from politicians that suggests the message is starting to get through.During Friday\u2019s conversation, Balsillie also stressed that, if small countries such as Canada make a point of prioritizing the intangible economy, there are huge opportunities. He pointed to Israel, Finland and Singapore as examples of how smart policies and specialization can reap big rewards.\u201cI could literally see enormously powerful positions for Canada if we choose the right places. I mean, there are some obvious ones: value added in the food business, and precision data and IP in agriculture; certainly in energy extraction and mining, which are data and technology businesses,\u201d he said.\u201cWe actually have enormous opportunities to build the resilience and opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd how can you threaten a country with a picture of a Chevy and 25 per cent tariffs when you\u2019ve built these kinds of very powerful innovation infrastructures that you can\u2019t stop with a tariff because they move with the click of a mouse?\u201d"}
