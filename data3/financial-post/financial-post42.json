But if people have overextended themselves, given the low interest rates, then we\u2019ve got a transition issue. That\u2019s why we\u2019re putting so much emphasis on that and analyzing it so carefully, and choosing our pace as we gather the data.\u201dWe want to improve your reading experience"}
