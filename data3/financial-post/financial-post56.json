In the report, the watchdog warned that that culture had potentially increased the risk of mistreating customers, albeit with the caveat that it did not discover \u201cwidespread mis-selling\u201d of products or services.Authorized foreign banks would also be subjected to stronger provisions in relation to the protection of customers and the public, according to a summary of the bill.\u201cAny advertisement in Canada that is made by an institution shall be accurate, clear and not misleading,\u201d adds another section.\u2022 gzochodne@postmedia.com | Twitter.com/geoffzochodneWe want to improve your reading experience"}
