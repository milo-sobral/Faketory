We don\u2019t do that\u2026. We make best-in-class products and this is an opportunity to buy best-in-class technology and use it for our own footwear line.\u201dFootwear will eventually join a widening roster of offerings that already includes a number of lighter weight products, such as rain gear and knitwear.That means, as the company eyes new locations for expansion, it won\u2019t be confined to desperately cold places, Reiss said.That expansion will take its next step on Friday, when Canada Goose opens a flagship store in temperate Vancouver, to be followed by others in Montreal and Beijing before the holiday shopping season begins in earnest.The Beijing store comes after the opening of a Canada Goose flagship in Hong Kong last month, and the opening of a Shanghai regional office and a China e-commerce sales partnership through through the Alibaba Group. Since its wildly successful initial public offering last year, Canada Goose has been focused on its entrance into China while continuing to grow its retail stores.\u201cWe\u2019ve built this brand by doing things that other people aren\u2019t doing,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cNow, in these times, more often than not, brands are closing stores \u2026 There\u2019s this so-called retail apocalypse.\u201cTo be able to be in a situation where we\u2019re opening stores in this kind of landscape \u2026 that\u2019s just another example of how, even as a larger company, we can continue to swim upstream.\u201dThe push to open news stores started in 2016, with the goal of opening up to 20 locations by 2020 \u2013 a target Reiss said Canada Goose is on track to meet with stores currently in Toronto, New York, London, Chicago, Boston, Calgary, Tokyo and New Jersey. Next, Reiss said, he sees more \u201cgeographic opportunities\u201d in the U.S. and Europe, as well as more in China and Canada. But he wouldn\u2019t say where.\u201cIf you had to guess the list, I think you\u2019d probably do pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t rule out hot climates. But we have a long list of cities that we\u2019d like to be in and we want to do it very carefully and methodically.\u201dTo be able to be in a situation where we\u2019re opening stores in this kind of (retail) landscape ... that\u2019s just another example of how \u2026 we can continue to swim upstreamBut that kind of expansion can\u2019t be without complications. Asked if there were challenges to growth in China, Reiss said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of bureaucracy in China that you have to be prepared to deal with.\u201d The expansion could have also riled the giant department store chains that are his wholesale partners, upset with the prospect of competing with Canada Goose store in certain markets. But that didn\u2019t happen, Reiss said.\u201cIf you asked them, \u2018Would you rather if Canada Goose opened a store or not?\u2019 They\u2019d say no. And that\u2019s natural, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBut not even! That\u2019s not even true, entirely. Because, you know, flagship stores for global brands are common and really help elevate the brand both in global and local markets. So no, we really have experienced little pushback.\u201dReiss, who two decades ago took over the family business his grandfather started in the 1950s, has become an ardent protector of the Canada Goose brand. To date, he said, he has inspected each location before signing the lease and visits each store on an annual basis.\u201cDepending on how many stores we have, one day I might not be able to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take that one day at a time, or one year at a time, or one month at a time or something like that.\u201dCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
