The near doubling of yields to just under 3 per cent over the past year is a clear signal the U.S. economy, stock market and credit market have peaked and a recession is likely on the way, he said.\u201cWe are scraping the bottom of the barrel on the pool of available labour. That is inflationary,\u201d Rosenberg said in an interview Tuesday as equities plunged, before paring losses later in the day. \u201cInflation and the Fed have ended every single bull market and economic expansion in the modern era.\u201dTax cuts, deregulation and easy money are behind the markets, he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s left are tariffs and trade barriers and a high degree of political uncertainty layered on top of that, and a Fed chairperson with a slightly hawkish bent.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to say when the next recession will hit but Rosenberg says he\u2019s building a base case for the second half of next year. He recommends investors stand ready to take advantage of a \u201crenewed, dramatic widening in credit spreads,\u201d and be defensive in stocks, including utilities and consumer staples. Financials however \u201coffer good value now.\u201dHe favours companies with low cyclicality, high earnings visibility and high capital-labor ratios that won\u2019t suffer margin compression from rising costs. \u201cIt\u2019s more about style than price points,\u201d he said, declining to give a target for U.S. stock markets. Investors should cull their portfolios, remain highly defensive and focus on liquidity.Gluskin Sheff\u2019s balanced funds are at about 50 per cent equity, 15 per cent equity alternatives and 35 per cent fixed income and its risk average portfolios are at 40 per cent equities and 60 per cent fixed income, Rosenberg said.Bloomberg.comThis content was provided by Market One for commercial purposes."}
