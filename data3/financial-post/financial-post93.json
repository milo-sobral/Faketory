Apple introduced the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in late September. Previously, Amazon sold only older model iPhones.\u201cAmazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want,\u201d the Seattle-based company said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally.\u201dIPhone unit sales barely increased in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Apple reported earlier this month, even though the new flagship devices came out in the period. The smartphone remains the Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s most important device, generating about 60 percent of quarterly sales and tying customers to other services such as Apple\u2019s music and video streaming.The two tech giants have clashed in the past.Amazon in 2015 stopped selling the Apple TV media-streaming device that wasn\u2019t easily compatible with the e-commerce giant\u2019s video service, an example of Amazon using its clout as the world\u2019s biggest online retailer to promote products that helped push its own streaming content.In 2016, Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging that the online retailer was selling counterfeit Apple products on its web store.Amazon won\u2019t be selling Apple\u2019s HomePod, the iPhone maker\u2019s competitor to Amazon\u2019s popular Echo brand of home wireless speakers.Bloomberg.com"}
