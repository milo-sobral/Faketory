{"id": "Banks' advice to Stephen Poloz: Consider Alberta's oil woes before plotting your next rate moveNewsTop Stories", "paragraph": "November 9, 20183:34 PM ESTThe wider Canadian economy will soon start feeling the pain being endured by Alberta oil producers for the past few months, and that should give the Bank of Canada reason to pause before plotting its next move, according to two of the country\u2019s major banks.Most Canadian oil producers put up a strong show in the third quarter, but warned of production cuts and lower spending as their barrels are fetching roughly a third of the global prices due to pipeline shortages.\u201cMore immediately, production is being curtailed in Q4 in an effort to alleviate pressure on the differential from pipeline and rail bottlenecks,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients Friday. \u201cThere will therefore be negative real GDP impacts beginning in the current quarter and extending into next year, as well as hits to the nominal trade and current account balance.\u201dCanadian heavy oil benchmark Western Canada Select was trading at a US$42 discount to West Texas Intermediate on Friday, according to Bloomberg data.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. plans to reduce drilling activity and cut production due to pipeline constraints.\u201cThese factors will play a prominent role in 2019 and future capital allocation decisions,\u201d the company said at its third-quarter earnings announcement.Adding to the industry\u2019s woes, a judge in Montana ordered TransCanada Corp. on Thursday to halt construction on Keystone XL pipeline \u2014 a vital conduit that would connect Alberta to the Gulf Coast and would alleviate price pressures on Canadian barrels.Global oil markets are also in a state of flux, having lost 22 per cent in less than a month that\u2019s plunged it into bear market territory. U.S. crude was trading at US$60.04 Friday, after dropping under US$60 a barrel to its lowest in eight months.Douglas Porter, BMO Capital Markets\u2019 chief economist, argued in a note Friday that policymakers have been too calm about the softness in WCS, chiding Governor Poloz for suggesting in a speech earlier this week that the recent \u201cespecially large\u201d discount was due to maintenance and will be temporary.\u201cHeading into a wave of fall fiscal updates, most notably from Ottawa on November 21, the deep dive in oil is the one new factor that could throw the proverbial cat among the revenue pigeons.\u201d Porter noted in his report on Friday, referring to Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s announcement later in November expected to provide incentives to the private sector.Similarly, Sheffield says that while Bank of Canada\u2019s October Monetary Policy Report was sanguine on the country\u2019s brewing oil crisis, \u201cit will be hard to ignore when Poloz\u2019s team announces its December rate decision.\u201dThe Bank of Canada did mention in its monetary policy report that the drop in Western Canada Select prices was weighing on Canada\u2019s terms of trade.\u201cFirms are continuing to expand capacity in response to strong domestic and foreign demand, except in the oil and gas sector, where transportation constraints are an ongoing challenge,\u201d the Bank said in its report.Oil accounted for nearly two-thirds of the growth in exports in the third quarter, primarily due to higher prices, according to Statistics Canada.But the sector, which is the country\u2019s largest export product and accounts for a third of business capital spending, is expected to be a drag on GDP growth in the next few quarters.\u201cAs much as the Bank of Canada wants to demonstrate it can hike on a rate decision date that\u2019s not accompanied by an MPR, December won\u2019t be the time to do so with this story in the spotlight,\u201d wrote Shenfeld.Porter concedes, however, that it\u2019s tough to argue against the Bank slowly lifting rates amid the lowest jobless rate in 40 years and core inflation hovering right around target.\u201cHaving said all that, and even recognizing that the Bank won\u2019t be swayed by market volatility, an extended period of weakness in oil prices is one new development that could indeed stay its tightening hand,\u201d Porter said.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that the odds on a hike over the next two meetings (i.e., by January 9) are lower than the market\u2019s guess of 90%.\u201dThere is a 75 per cent chance the Bank of Canada will maintain rates at its December 5 meeting, according to a Bloomberg forecast.We want to improve your reading experience"}
