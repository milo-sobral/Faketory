{"id": "Bank of Canada inches closer to normal with rate hike \u2014 and signals more to comeEconomyTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 24, 20182:56 PM EDTLast UpdatedOctober 24, 20184:26 PM EDTThe Bank of Canada can finally see \u201chome\u201d on the horizon.Governor Stephen Poloz and his deputies on the Governing Council raised the benchmark interest rate a quarter-point to 1.75 per cent on Wednesday, as expected.They said they feel pretty good about the economy, now that politicians in Canada, Mexico, and the United States have agreed on a revised trade agreement, and that evidence suggests households are adjusting well to higher borrowing costs. Policy makers raised their outlook for business investment and exports, suggesting the economy is becoming less reliant on debt-fuelled spending and the housing market.\u201cThe Canadian economy continues to operate near its capacity, and growth is relatively broad-based across sectors and regions,\u201d Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor, said at a press conference in Ottawa. \u201cWhat stands out is that, even with today\u2019s increase \u2026 monetary policy remains stimulative.\u201dWilkins\u2019s emphasis on the still-low level of borrowing costs was a reminder that the public needn\u2019t panic at the sight of marginally higher interest rates, and a gentle warning that no one should expect interest rates to stay at this level.The economy is growing a little faster than the Bank of Canada predicted a few months ago, and \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d from elevated levels of household debt are \u201cedging lower,\u201d it said. Policy makers reiterated that interest rates must rise, and for the first time offered a more definitive notion of where it wants to go.\u201cGoverning Council agrees that the policy interest rate will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve the inflation target,\u201d the bank said in a statement explaining the latest policy decision.Poloz, who took over as the governor of Canada\u2019s central bank in 2014, has talked wistfully about returning interest rates to a level that economists associate with normal, a place where the cost of money is neither stimulating expansion nor curbing growth. The central bank estimates that \u201cneutral\u201d interest rate \u2014 which Poloz has characterized as \u201chome\u201d \u2014 is something between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent.There will be a debate on Bay Street and Wall Street about how fast the Bank of Canada wants to close the gap between the neutral rate and the current setting. Analysts tended to call the central bank\u2019s latest communication \u201chawkish,\u201d a widely used term that implies the central bank is more apt to raise interest rates than to cut them or leave them unchanged. The value of the dollar jumped in the minutes following the release of the policy statement, as traders noticed that \u201cgradual\u201d had been dropped from the text. Policy makers had used that modifier in three consecutive policy statements to make sure the public knew that the economy was facing a lot of headwinds.There will be a temptation to assume the central bank\u2019s decision to take out the eraser is a signal that interest-rate increases will become more frequent. In fact, the Bank of Canada\u2019s outlook is about the same as it was a few weeks ago; if there\u2019s a shift, it\u2019s that policy makers are more confident that outlook will come true.More likely, Poloz, who has made a point of avoiding explicit guidance, wanted to keep investors and others from reverting to their old habits of putting textual analysis ahead of number crunching. The new policy statement says the pace of interest-rate increases will be determined by \u201chow the economy is adjusting to higher interest rates, given the elevated level of household debt\u201d and \u201cglobal trade policy developments.\u201d The resolution of the North American trade dispute is a relief, but the central bank expressed heightened concern of the U.S. trade war with China.\u201cYou may have noticed that we have not used the word \u2018gradual\u2019 to describe the pace of policy adjustments,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cThis is to avoid the impression that we are following a preordained, mechanical path.\u201dPoloz acknowledged that the new wording gives the Governing Council more flexibility, but that he and his lieutenants have no idea how they will use that maneuverability. He said he was prompted to make the change because the Street had come to associate \u201cgradual\u201d with an increase every couple of meetings. \u201cThis is serving notice that it could be faster or it could be slower,\u201d Poloz said.That\u2019s probably right. The numbers suggest interest rates could be higher, but that understanding of how the economy works is based on periods when household debt was much lower than it is now. The central bank went out of its way to say that even though it\u2019s comfortable with the way Canadians are adjusting to higher borrowing costs, household vulnerabilities \u201cremain elevated.\u201d Wilkins also said stronger business investment probably means the economy has more capacity to produce inflation-free growth. If so, the central bank\u2019s path \u201chome\u201d could still be gradual, although policy makers might refrain from calling it that.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how markets can focus on one word,\u201d Tom O\u2019Gorman, director of fixed income at Franklin Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, said. \u201cThey are going to be data dependent and that makes sense.\u201d\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevinWe want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
