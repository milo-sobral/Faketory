The deal is expected to close before the end of the company\u2019s current fiscal year in February 2019, pending regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.BlackBerry noted the deal would particularly complement its QNX unit, which makes software for cars, and its UEM unit, which helps secure various devices, such as smartphones or laptops.A presentation on the deal said that Cylance\u2019s AI-backed products both predict and protect \u201cagainst known and unknown threats.\u201dThe private company and its approximately 900 employees, according to BlackBerry, can typically identify and analyze threats 25 months before they emerge. Cylance says it does its work by applying AI, algorithmic science and machine learning to cybersecurity.\u201cWe prove every day that you can actually identify attacks long before they ever start,\u201d said Stuart McClure, chairman and chief executive at Cylance. \u201cWhat we call the unknown-unknowns, and we truly prevent them.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Cylance would continue to function as an independent business unit, one that recently offered to provide antivirus software, free of charge, to all of the 2018 political campaigns in the U.S.In an August press release, McClure said that \u201cit is clear that malicious actors are ramping up their activity in advance of the midterms, and we know malevolent hackers will exploit any vulnerability at any level to undermine a candidate\u2019s run for office.\u201cWe want to do our part to protect the democratic process from interference however we can, wherever we can.\u201dThere are no doubts in my mind that we are acquiring cutting-edge technologyThis month, Cylance also released a research report that it said \u201cexplores the identification and tracking of a new \u2014 and likely state-sponsored \u2014 threat actor.\u201d That actor, the company added, had conducted a year-long espionage campaign aimed at Pakistan\u2019s air force.\u201cCylance calls the campaign Operation Shaheen and the organization The White Company \u2014 in acknowledgement of the many elaborate measures the organization takes to whitewash all signs of its activity and evade attribution,\u201d the press release added.Prior to that, in 2014, Cylance published a report alleging that there had been \u201ccoordinated attacks by hackers based in Iran on more than 50 targets in 16 countries around the globe,\u201d a release said.BlackBerry said the acquisition would bring in approximately 100 additional patents and patent applications in cybersecurity and machine learning.Chen said that Cylance\u2019s customer base would also complement that of his own company, which he noted includes clients in the financial service and government sectors.\u201cThere are no doubts in my mind that we are acquiring cutting-edge technology,\u201d\u00a0he added.Shares of BlackBerry rose following news of the deal, and closed up 1.46 per cent on Friday in Toronto, at $11.82.\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne"}
