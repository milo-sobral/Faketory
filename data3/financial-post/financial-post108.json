Its applications seek to block malware or infiltration attempts rather than react after a breach.Cylance, which has over 3,500 active enterprise customers, had been considering filing for a stock market floatation, according to a report in Business Insider.\u201cCylance\u2019s leadership in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity will immediately complement our entire portfolio,\u201d BlackBerry CEO John Chen said in a statement.The California-based company\u2019s Chief Executive Stuart McClure, in turn, said it would be able to leverage Blackberry\u2019s strength in mobile communications and security to adapt its AI technology.Besides the US$1.4 billion that BlackBerry will pay, the deal also includes the assumption of Cylance\u2019s unvested employee incentives, BlackBerry said.Cylance will continue to operate as a separate business unit after the deal closes, BlackBerry said. The deal is expected to close by Feb 2019.U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry were marginally up in light pre-market trading.\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018"}
