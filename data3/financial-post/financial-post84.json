{"id": "Apple, suppliers tumble as signs mount of weak iPhone demandPersonal TechTop Stories", "paragraph": "November 12, 201810:38 AM ESTApple Inc\u2019 and major suppliers to the company\u2019s iPhone fell Monday as investors fretted that one of the most important product lines in the technology sector was seeing weak demand.The latest warning sign was Lumentum Holdings Inc. cutting its second-quarter outlook after one of its largest customers asked to \u201cmeaningfully reduce shipments\u201d for previously placed orders. Lumentum didn\u2019t name the customer, but Apple is its biggest, according to Bloomberg supply-chain data. Shares of Lumentum plummeted a record 30 per cent while Apple dropped as much as 4.1 per cent. Oclaro Inc., which is being bought by Lumentum, lost 11 per cent, on track for its biggest drop since April.\u201cWe think investors should consider Lumentum\u2019s updated guide as reflecting as much as a 30 per cent cut in Apple orders,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note to clients.Loop Capital Markets also said the customer is likely Apple. The development \u201cis not entirely surprising\u201d but \u201cit seems very likely to us that the market for 3D sensing-related light sources and other components is going to be smaller next year than previously anticipated,\u201d analyst James Kisner said in a research note.Among other Apple suppliers, Cirrus Logic Inc. dropped 10 per cent at 9:49 a.m. in New York. Qorvo Inc. slid 7.3 per cent, Skyworks Solutions Inc. fell 2.8 per cent, Finisar Corp. dropped 4.7 per cent and Broadcom Inc. fell 5.3 per cent. Semiconductor stocks were broadly lower with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down 3 per cent. Lumentum\u2019s outlook comes a week after Nikkei reported that Apple was cancelling a production boost for its iPhone XR line, and less than two weeks after Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter results showed tepid unit sales growth. The company also said it would stop providing unit sales for iPhones, iPads, and Macs in fiscal 2019, a step Nomura Instinet said raised \u201cthe spectre of a sustained iPhone downturn.\u201dAdding to Monday\u2019s negative news, Longbow Research cautioned that Apple is facing weak iPhone demand in China. And Citi downgraded Skyworks to neutral and slashed its price target to US$85 from US$116, citing both \u201cdisappointing iPhone XR unit sales\u201d and \u201cbroad smartphone weakness.\u201d Last week, Skyworks gave a first-quarter outlook that missed expectations because of smartphone weakness, prompting at least two other downgrades.Citi also cut its target on Qorvo on Monday due to iPhone XR weakness.\u2013With assistance from Kamaron Leach.Bloomberg.com"}
