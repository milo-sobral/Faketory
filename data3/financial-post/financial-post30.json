{"id": "Realizing the possible: Mentoring women to be heard in the boardroomEntrepreneurTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 24, 20188:28 AM EDTLast UpdatedOctober 24, 20188:28 AM EDTWith her father\u2019s encouragement, Daniela Tixi learned to fly a plane at the age of 16, even though she wouldn\u2019t be able to get her driver\u2019s licence for another two years. This accomplishment would set the mantra for her entire career: Never feel boxed in, because anything is possible.Today, as CEO of Strategic HR Asset (SHRA) and the first female president of the M&A Club in Toronto (a professional network created to encourage M&A and financing conversations), Tixi is proving this mantra true. She has earned a reputation as a mentor, change advocate and avid promoter of Canadian brands across Europe and the U.S.Through her boutique company, SHRA, which she founded in 2016, Tixi is leveraging human capital and business strategies to scale small and medium-sized enterprises in Canada to Europe and or the U.S. The organization, which fluctuates in number of employees depending on project, employs entrepreneurs and C-Suite executives as well as HR specialists. Tixi considers herself a \u201cvisionary culture champion\u201d inspiring employees to \u201clive and breathe\u201d their brands, and has a portfolio of clients ranging in assets from $5 million to $1 billion.Last November, Tixi was approached by the folks at M&A to present on the important role of strategic HR in terms of due diligence in finance discussions.Soon after, she was approached by the group\u2019s founder to head the Toronto chapter as president, a post she officially began in January 2018. Discovering that there were so few female members, Tixi has made it part of her agenda to improve the gender ratio. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m filling a quota, but I\u2019ll do anything I can to promote the validity of females in leadership roles,\u201d says Tixi. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re not seeing more women participating in M&A discussions because they\u2019ve never been invited to the table.\u201dThe daughter of Italian diplomats, Tixi\u2019s business and leadership savvy was instilled early on. \u201cMy father was an orphan raised in the air force who ended up working on high-level strategies for diplomatic missions around the world,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother spoke five languages and was a commissioner with the Italian Trade Commission while raising five kids.\u201d Dinner conversations would often focus around global politics and trade opportunities. \u201cIt was a very rich education overall, and certainly not typical dinner conversations for a child,\u201d says Tixi. \u201cBoth my parents are the reason I feel confident as a woman today because they\u2019ve never distinguished between the genders.\u201dBorn and raised in downtown Rome and the oldest of the siblings, Tixi was trained in accounting and worked at various Italian-based companies in her early career. There she quickly realized that the leadership traits encouraged by her parents would never be put to good use. \u201cIn a room full of voices, the women were never heard,\u201d she says of the atmosphere in those first workplace settings, noting that similar issues still prevail across Europe. \u201cI always had to have a male on my team to advance my ideas.\u201dSo in 1994, at the age of 24, she moved to Toronto, landing a job at Telelatino (now part of Omni Television) and helping the Italian Trade Commission expand its markets for top Italian brands \u2014 from helicopters to food and fashion. In 1997, Tixi joined Ferrero Canada well before its hazelnut chocolate confectioneries became a household name. \u201cWhen I joined the company it was losing millions and only the Italian community knew the brand in Canada,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were told this was a peanut butter country and that we\u2019d never sell our brand.\u201d As the first woman to join and ultimately design the company\u2019s HR department, Tixi was instrumental in building the executive team and helping persuade the top executives to build the company\u2019s largest confectionery plant in Ontario instead of New Jersey, which resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs.I see myself as a conscientious vessel through which other women can voice their decisions in the boardroomOne of her biggest breakthroughs came soon after in working with Pusateri\u2019s Fine Foods. There she helped restructure and reposition the Toronto-based family grocer, which eventually led to a partnership with Saks Fifth Avenue. Her success with Pusateri\u2019s prompted her to open a business where she could help startups with the funds and strategies to find their own successes. \u201cThe more I talked to other companies, the more passionate I got about this made-in-Canada concept,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how I can help these Canadian companies scale up and bring their brands to Europe and elsewhere.\u201d In fact, Tixi was part of the first CETA trade delegation in Milan and Rome with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017.Tixi also thrives in mentoring women behind the scenes, saying that she could have used some female mentors herself. \u201cI sit down and help women structure their companies but then it\u2019s their success to claim,\u201d she says. \u201cAll throughout my career, I saw myself as a conscientious vessel through which other women could voice their decisions in the boardroom \u2014 and I was promoting women executives in every organization I ever worked for.\u201dCaroline Spivak, founder and principal of Profile Communications in Toronto, met Tixi at a women in finance investment event more than a year ago. \u201cHer high energy, drive, strategic mind and overall success made us immediate kindred spirits,\u201d says Spivak. \u201cI aspire to achieve her level of success and am privileged to benefit from her enthusiasm and guidance.\u201dSpivak says Tixi provides her with direct and practical advice on an ongoing basis, and has championed her business ideas while opening doors to others in her network. \u201cEveryone needs help at every level of their career or business development in order to scale to the next level,\u201d says Spivak, who just celebrated her company\u2019s 10th anniversary. \u201cMentorship is not just for those starting their careers.\u201dAs for future plans, Tixi points to bold aspirations ahead. \u201cMy dream is for Canada to be at the forefront of trade and for our governments to help us get there,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to inspire women and companies to realize what they think is the impossible.\u201d"}
