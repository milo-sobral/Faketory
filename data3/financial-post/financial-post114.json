{"id": "'Borderline treasonous': Oil executives sound alarm as foreign investors fleeEnergyTop Stories", "paragraph": "November 15, 20186:39 PM ESTCALGARY \u2014 Canadian energy executives are becoming increasingly vocal about the country losing its competitive edge relative to their peers in the United States, saying it\u2019s \u201cvery, very worrisome\u201d that investors are exiting the domestic energy sector.\u201cIf the people of Canada think for one moment that we can only have Canadian investors and hope to drive any type of business going forward, they are absolutely, massively mistaken,\u201d Grant Fagerheim. president and CEO of Whitecap Resources Inc., said in in an interview about the exodus of foreign investors in the domestic oil and gas industry.Their concerns were echoed by a foreign institutional investor in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that was shared with the Financial Post. The letter marks the second time in recent weeks a fund manager outside of Canada has directed their concerns to Trudeau.\u201cMoving forward, I hope your government will start to recognize the numerous issues that are affecting Canada\u2019s energy sector, and do everything in its power to support an industry which has benefited Canadian prosperity for a long period of time,\u201d Susan Johns, a U.K.-based fund manager, said in the letter, dated Nov. 7.It follows a similar note last month by Darren Peers, an analyst and investor at Los Angeles-based Capital Research, a US$1.7-trillion fund, which criticized Ottawa for allowing Canadian energy competitiveness to lag.Johns, who was previously with London-based Consulta, but is now running her own fund called Susan Johns LP, stated in her letter that she has invested in Canadian junior and intermediate companies for more than 30 years.It is \u201chard for me to watch such a vibrant industry being strangled by regulation, carbon taxes and the inability of producers to get their product to world markets,\u201d she said in the letter.Fagerheim said Johns is a household name among junior and intermediate energy CEOs in Canada. Johns did not respond to a request for comment.In his Oct. 19 letter, Peers said that while he recognizes that Ottawa \u201chas done a lot to maintain Canada\u2019s competitiveness as a country to invest in, when it comes to energy it has not done enough.\u201dExecutives said the two letters should create a sense of urgency that Ottawa needs to take corrective action quickly.\u201cIt is very, very worrisome what is happening to the energy industry in Canada from a competitiveness perspective. That worry for me is even more exacerbated when I look at what\u2019s happening south of the border,\u201d said Cenovus Energy Inc. president and CEO Alex Pourbaix.Pourbaix said the U.S. government is working to streamline permit applications there and \u201cCanada ignores these red flags at its peril.\u201d\u201cNo one is required to invest in Canada,\u201d Pourbaix said.It\u2019s mystifying to me why there still doesn\u2019t seem to be action taken. It\u2019s borderline treasonousEric Nuttall, Toronto-based senior portfolio manager with Ninepoint Partners, who invests in Canadian oil and gas stocks, said \u201cit\u2019s not surprising\u201d that other fund managers are coming forward with their concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s mystifying to me why there still doesn\u2019t seem to be action taken,\u201d Nuttall said. \u201cIt\u2019s borderline treasonous.\u201dBut energy executives say fund managers and investors don\u2019t normally like to be in the limelight. Pourbaix said instuitional investors don\u2019t normally embark on letter-writing campaigns, and other executives agreed.\u201cI don\u2019t think investors like to be in the public eye with their investment risks and strategies. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common behaviour,\u201d said Precision Drilling Corp. president and CEO Kevin Neveu.Neveu said all of the country\u2019s investment banks track investment flows in and out of Canada, and the numbers show there\u2019s very little flowing into the country\u2019s oil and gas sector. That should be alarming to Ottawa, he said.\u201cOur government doesn\u2019t need investor letters to show them what is going on \u2014 the data is there,\u201d Neveu said.\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorganCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
