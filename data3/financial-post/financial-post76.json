Analysts were looking for US$92.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Apple said it will stop reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads, and Macs beginning in fiscal 2019, CFO Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call.Apple\u2019s shares extended a slump in late trading after the comments, falling as much as 7.4 per cent.Apple has long reported unit sales and revenue numbers for its major devices, such as the signature iPhone. Maestri said a 90-day snapshot of how many units are sold isn\u2019t an accurate picture of Apple\u2019s business.Fiscal fourth-quarter sales rose 20 per cent to US$62.9 billion, Apple said. Profit came in at US$2.91 a share. Analysts expected revenue of US$61.4 billion and earnings of US$2.78 a share.The company sold 46.9 million iPhones in the quarter, generating revenue of US$37.2 billion. The number fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates and was a disappointment, considering there were no big iPhone launches in the same quarter last year. But higher prices of newer iPhones helped. The period included about a week and a half of sales of the high-end iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max models, which cost as much as US$1,449.The iPhone XR is one of the few outliers from the trend of more costly Apple gadgets. With a starting price of US$749, it\u2019s expected to be a popular holiday gift, luring owners of older iPhones to upgrade. The iPhone still looms large over Apple\u2019s fortunes, accounting for more than 60 per cent of revenue. It\u2019s also the central hub for connecting the other devices and using services.The average iPhone selling price was US$793. Analysts were looking for 48.4 million iPhone units in the quarter, and an average selling price of US$729.This content was provided by Market One for commercial purposes."}
