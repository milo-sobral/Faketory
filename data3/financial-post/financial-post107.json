Dozens of trailers were also sitting idle in Montreal and Vancouver.The Crown corporation issued new contract offers this week aimed at reaching agreements with its approximately 42,000 urban employees and 8,000 rural and suburban carriers.CUPW said the latest proposals made positive steps, but not enough to put an end to walkouts, which rotated Friday through most of Manitoba, as well as communities in Ontario, B.C., Alberta and New Brunswick.The offers were time sensitive, with Canada Post imposing a deadline of Saturday at one minute before midnight for acceptance.CUPW national president Mike Palecek wouldn\u2019t say whether tentative deals could be reached by then, but said the union would not be held to an arbitrary deadline.Palecek was also critical of Canada Post for halting shipments from outside Canada.\u201cThere is no reason to halt international shipments,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLet us solve our issues at the bargaining table.\u201dThe union said it wants concrete proposals for dealing with an escalating number of work injuries at Canada Post.Hamilton said the corporation has proposed a way for the company and union to work together to identify ways to make the workplace safer, and offered to fast-track a review of workloads to reduce overburdening of carriers who have seen a rapid increase in the number of parcels they have to deliver while letter volumes have declined.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned last week his government will act to end the rotating strikes if there is no significant progress in the negotiations. Trudeau did not specify what type of action might be taken, nor did he provide a timeline.Earlier this week, eBay called on Trudeau to legislate an end to the dispute in time for Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events tied to American Thanksgiving that begin Nov. 23."}
