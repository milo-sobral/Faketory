That time, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government was overstepping its authority, which led to the creation of the current cooperative model with the participation of Ottawa and willing provinces.So far, the cooperative regulator, while not truly national, has the support of Ottawa, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and Yukon.Anita Anand, a law professor at University of Toronto who specializes in securities and governance issues, said Friday\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201cwell reasoned\u201d and should allow the creation of the new regulator to move forward within the established boundaries.The court ruled that the current model does not impede provincial powers to enact securities regulation, and held that the federal government has the constitutional power to regulate in the area of \u201csystemic\u201d risk because this type of regulation is not intended to affect day-to-day regulation of securities markets.With the court\u2019s endorsement of the current regulatory model, Anand said a question remains about where the Liberal government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, stand on the idea of a cooperative regulator, which they inherited when they took power.\u201cThey have been conspicuously quiet on the issue of securities regulation in this country, which is surprising given that over 50 per cent of adult Canadians are invested in the capital markets,\u201d she said.Mark Machin, chief executive of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, called Friday\u2019s court ruling \u201can encouraging development,\u201d adding that \u201cnationwide regulation is generally a good thing.\u201dBrigeeta Richdale, a partner and securities litigator at law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell in Vancouver, said there isn\u2019t yet a clear timeline for when the new regulator will be functional, but the cooperative model should improve enforcement and harmonize policy interpretation.\u201cIndustries that have been struggling to navigate regulation in Canada will be provided greater clarity in a more transparent and supportive regulatory environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThese conditions are critical to ensure long-term success in emerging markets like cryptocurrency and cannabis as we enter a progressive new era of conducting business at a global scale.\u201dHowever, investor advocates remain critical of some aspects of Canada\u2019s newest securities regulator, which would not carry forward an investor advisory panels or investor education offices established by existing provincial regulators such as the Ontario Securities Commission.\u201cWhile the objectives of the proposed cooperative system are long standing and laudable, the delicate process of inter provincial negotiations has resulted in a proposed system which waters down or eliminates key investor protection initiatives by some provinces,\u201d said Harold Geller, a lawyer at MBC Law Professional Corp. in Toronto.\u201cWe will be stepping back to a time when the civil courts were the protectors of investors from dealer and advisor abuses and negligence,\u201d added Geller, a former member of the OSC\u2019s investor advisory committee.We want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
