In Canada, the two main providers of this function for the banks are the not-for-profit Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) and ADR Chambers Banking Ombuds Office (ADRBO), a private, for-profit company.\u2026 the question of how the banks resolve customer complaints remains a sensitive subject in CanadaBill C-86 would not force the two external complaints bodies to change their names.\u00a0The status quo, though, has met with dissatisfaction from consumer groups, which was reignited after the Bank of Nova Scotia announced in September that it would switch from OBSI to ADRBO for banking-related complaints, joining Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada. OBSI remains the ombudsman for investment-related complaints for all the banks.CARP (formerly the\u00a0Canadian Association for Retired Persons), the Consumers Council of Canada and FAIR Canada have already launched a letter-writing campaign to push Ottawa to mandate that there be a \u201csingle impartial, non-profit external complaints body \u2014 one that is not perceived to favour the banks,\u201d a press release put out on Thursday said.\u00a0The same release criticized the federal government for not making the change to a single ombudsman with Bill C-86, saying the legislation\u00a0\u201cleaves in place a multiple external complaints body system and, therefore, fails to protect Canadian banking customers by denying them access to a non-profit, independent dispute resolution provider.\u201dHowever, the federal government says that Bill C-86 will still require the banks to be a member of an approved independent external complaints body.Those bodies, the government added, \u201cmust maintain a strong reputation for being operated in a manner consistent with the standards of good character and integrity, and to ensure that complaints are addressed in an impartial and independent manner.\u201d\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodneWe want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
