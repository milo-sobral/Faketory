The defendants said no prison time was justified.Lawyers for Tanner and Davenport did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The case was the first criminal prosecution arising from multiple probes into Valeant\u2019s business practices, including its ties to the now-defunct Philidor.Those ties began drawing scrutiny in October 2015, when investors learned that Valeant had in 2014 acquired an option to buy Philidor, and was suspected of using it to boost sales.The revelations contributed to a steep fall in Valeant\u2019s share price that was compounded by the probes and the Laval, Quebec-based company\u2019s heavy debt load.Management was overhauled, and Valeant changed its name to Bausch Health Cos in July, taken from the name of its Bausch & Lomb eye care unit.Tanner had managed Valeant\u2019s relationship with Philidor as well as Valeant\u2019s \u201calternative fulfillment\u201d program, through which the drugmaker sought to increase prescriptions for its own drugs instead of generic substitutes.Prosecutors accused Tanner of steering Valeant business to Philidor, while concealing a US$9.7 million kickback from Davenport that came from the roughly US$50 million Davenport received when Valeant acquired the option to buy his company.\u201cI deeply regret giving money to Gary Tanner,\u201d Davenport told Preska.Prosecutors said that to keep the scheme secret, Tanner often used an email account with the name \u201cBrian Wilson\u201d to communicate with Davenport and sabotage potential business with rival pharmacies.\u201cTanner was entrusted to manage Valeant\u2019s relationship with Davenport\u2019s company,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. \u201cInstead, they devised a scheme to pillage Valeant and share the proceeds.\u201dThe case is U.S. v Tanner et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cr-00061.\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018We want to improve your reading experience"}
