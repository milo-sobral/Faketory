Goodman and CPPIB have committed a total of US$5 billion to the partnership.Machin said the trade issues and fiscal tightening are developments that could nonetheless have an impact on economies around the world.\u201cIt\u2019s a concern that we have this really high trade tension between the U.S. and China\u2026. I think it\u2019s unlikely it goes away quickly, unfortunately,\u201d he said.Still, prices remain buoyant in the U.S., where future earnings expectations are much higher than elsewhere in the world, possibly unrealistically so, Machin suggested.\u201cWe\u2019re quite late cycle in the U.S. Markets are pricing in quite an optimistic outlook for corporate performance,\u201d he said.It\u2019s a concern that we have this really high trade tension between the U.S. and China\u2026. I think it\u2019s unlikely it goes away quickly, unfortunately\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at investments we have to be very careful the companies we\u2019re investing in are actually priced appropriately for the risk that they\u2019re not going to be able to meet those lofty expectations in the future.\u201dCPPIB reported investment returns of 0.6 per cent in the three months ended Sept 30, a period in which a strong Canadian dollar created a \u201ccurrency drag\u201d on returns. Many investments are held in foreign currencies, but the pension management organization reports in Canadian dollars and does not hedge currencies.Machin said returns can be expected to fluctuate with global economic cycles, and more focus should be placed on five- and 10-year returns because sustainability of the CPP Fund, which is invested to pay future benefits of the Canada Pension Plan, is measured over a 75-year period.The five and 10-year returns are 12.1 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively.We want to improve your reading experience"}
