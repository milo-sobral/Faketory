But we have to change. We have to continue to change to reach 300 billion or 500 billion,\u201d said Chief Executive Daniel Zhang, who is credited with being the architect of the original Singles\u2019 Day sale.Alibaba kicked off this year\u2019s sales with a gala event that featured U.S. singer Mariah Carey, a Japanese Beyonce impersonator and a Cirque du Soleil performance.It\u2019s expected to be the company\u2019s final November sale with founder and Chairman Jack Ma at the helm, with Zhang set to take over as chairman next year, the company said in September.During this year\u2019s event the company said it worked with 180,000 brands across over 200 countries, and shortly before midnight on Sunday it had sent over a billion packages.A disproportionately large number of sales were recorded in the first minutes of the 24-hour spending spree, when a huge queue of transactions went through for pre-ordered items.The company settled roughly US$1 billion within the first minute and 25 seconds after midnight.Analysts said the sales continued to be cannibalized by competing events, including the \u201c618\u201d festival spearheaded by Alibaba competitor JD.com Inc in June.JD.com, which also does a longer Singles\u2019 Day sales event culminating on Nov. 11, said sales in the period had hit 159.8 billion yuan (US$23 billion) this year, up about 26 per cent from last year.\u201cWith an increasing number of promotion events a year, consumers no longer feel that Double 11 is the only opportunity to get good bargains,\u201d said Pedro Yip, partner at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\u201cHaving said that, there are more consumers who still enjoy shopping at Double 11 than those that don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018"}
