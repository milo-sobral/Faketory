These also happen to be the stocks that have seen short-seller losses in excess of US$100 million this year.It isn\u2019t just the positive overall performance of the cannabis sector that has posed a challenge for short sellers.Currently, Dusaniwsky said, the shorts\u2019 biggest problem is that it has been difficult for brokers to locate shares to borrow and as a result the cost to do so has become inflated.Cannabis shares are mostly owned by retail investors, most of whom do not have the margin accounts necessary to borrow and lend shares, Dusaniwsky said. So high demand and low supply have resulted in borrowing fees that have reached the 30 to 40 per cent range and beyond, in some cases.Investors looking to short shares of Tilray currently have to deal with a 38 per cent borrow rate, according to S3. With a total short position worth about US$415 million as of Friday, that means shorts altogether are paying approximately US$388,000 per day to short the company.So far this year, shorting Tilray has been a costly trade, with total losses suffered by short sellers reaching US$340 million, according to S3.You've got to be right and you've got to be right pretty quick or else the stock borrow price is going to eat into your (profits)Those interested in Cronos Group will have to deal with a 42 per cent borrowing fee, while the highest borrowing fee \u2014 50 per cent \u2014 belongs to shares of Mississauga, Ont.-based The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd.Because of the borrowing costs, Dusaniwsky said, most investors cannot risk shorting cannabis stocks over the long term.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be right and you\u2019ve got to be right pretty quick or else the stock borrow price is going to eat into your (profits),\u201d he said.While they\u2019re interested in shorting individual companies, investors have shied away from shorting ETFs such as the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF. Dusaniwsky said this might suggest that investors are still confident the sector as a whole will continue to perform well, but individual companies may not.Going forward, long investors will continue to be enticed by the sector in hopes that a U.S. market solidifies, Dusaniwsky said, something that could bring more volatility \u2014 and more short sellers.Never miss a beat on stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs with customized Watchlist and Email Alerts.
