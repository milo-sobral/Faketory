That could involve reopening negotiations with Mexico, although U.S. and Mexican negotiators have both publicly ruled out that possibility.\u201cTrump made it seem like this was a done deal, but there is a long, long way to go,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., who is likely to be named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.The House will consider the agreement first under the Constitution\u2019s provision mandating that revenue bills originate in the lower chamber. A vote could take up to nine months or longer, according to senior administration officials.House Democrats are particularly concerned about a provision that would require at least 30 per cent of the labour used to build each car in Mexico to be completed by workers earning at least US$16 an hour. That amount will rise to 40 per cent by 2023 but the US$16 wage is not indexed to inflation, meaning the increase will be diluted over time as prices rise.The text of the agreement also requires Mexico to make it easier for workers to join unions.All of these actions were intended to make it less likely that automakers and other manufacturers would shift American jobs south for cheaper labour. But Democrats and their allies in manufacturing unions \u2014 who have remained neutral on the proposed pact \u2014 maintain that the new requirements, while an improvement on the original NAFTA, do not go far enough.They are demanding more specifics about how the deal will be enforced, and raising questions about whether the US$16-an-hour benchmark for Mexican workers \u2014 which is about four times the typical wage for Mexican autoworkers \u2014 is high enough to stanch the flow of American jobs to Mexico.\u201cWithout enforcement you don\u2019t have anything. Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding NAFTA,\u201d Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said last week, days before voters swept her party back into power.\u201cRight now, it is a work in progress,\u201d said Pelosi, a former speaker who is expected to reclaim that post. \u201cMexico has to pass a law about labour rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement. Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labour and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have both said publicly that they will not take up the agreement this year, although several free-trade proponents in their own party, led by Sen. Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are urging them to reconsider.Toomey has his own reservations about the deal \u2014 he believes it includes too many potential restrictions on free trade \u2014 but he warned his fellow Republicans that entering a protracted negotiation with Democrats would be a losing strategy.\u201cI would be shocked \u2014 shocked \u2014 to learn that Nancy Pelosi is going to make passing new NAFTA, which would be a big win for the president, her top priority,\u201d he said.Robert E. Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, has repeatedly assured Trump that he will be able to sell the deal to Democrats and the leaders of the United Steelworkers Union, the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers Union, according to current and former White House officials.\u201cWe are very confident that Congress will approve USMCA,\u201d said Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u201cFrom the beginning, Ambassador Lighthizer has worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate on the renegotiation of this agreement,\u201d he said, adding that the pact \u201cis a balanced deal with strong provisions that will benefit U.S. businesses and workers and that enjoys broad support among key stakeholders.\u201dBut there are signs that Lighthizer, who has a close working relationship with many labour leaders and pro-union Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, may have a tougher time than he anticipated.\u201cWords on a paper won\u2019t stop jobs from going to Mexico, unless there\u2019s real teeth behind them,\u201d Brown said.In late October, Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers Union and chairman of the U.S. trade representative\u2019s labour advisory council, reviewed the preliminary text of the deal and concluded that the new agreement contained provisions that \u201cundermine the interests of workers and consumers\u201d while doing too little to \u201ccurtail the illegal suppression of wages in Mexico,\u201d according to a letter sent to Lighthizer.In the letter, Gerard took issue with the administration\u2019s decision to maintain steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and questioned the effectiveness of the agreement\u2019s proposed automotive rules of origin intended to increase the percentage of cars built by American workers.But he saved his sharpest criticism for the Mexican wage provisions, arguing that the US$16 hour average wage mandated in the deal \u201cis arguably too low to make a significant difference\u201d in persuading manufacturers to keep their plants in the United States. He suggested making the wage standard a minimum, rather than an average, and suggested indexing it to inflation to ensure that the wage increases aren\u2019t \u201cmeaningless.\u201dAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist who was elected president of Mexico in July, supports wage increases but it is unclear if he can pass sweeping labour reforms through the country\u2019s legislature.During a private meeting with House members of both parties last month, Lighthizer conceded that the labour provisions needed to be strengthened, but he declined to reopen talks with Mexico, according to three people who attended the meeting.The NAFTA vote will be up or down and Congress cannot amend the text, according to the rules governing fast-track trade agreements. But negotiators from each country are free to negotiate potential changes to secure enough votes for passage in their respective chambers.Mexican officials have said the labour standards in the deal are sufficient. Emerson said Lighthizer rejected as \u201cfalse\u201d the idea that he would consider reopening the deal. The labour standards included in the deal, he added, \u201care ambitious and enforceable,\u201d he said.But Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who attended the meeting last month, called the provision \u201ca major flaw\u201d and said \u201cthere will have to be some attempt to discuss this with Mexico\u201d for the deal to win Democratic backing.Lighthizer remains eager to conclude a deal as quickly as possible, people close to him said, so he can focus on China, whose trade practices he sees as a far bigger threat to American workers than NAFTA, which has helped stitch together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States.But there\u2019s one tactic he refuses to use to break the logjam: withdrawing from NAFTA as a means of pressuring legislators to act quickly.Trump has raised the possibility repeatedly since being elected, but has been talked out of it by Lighthizer and other advisers, most recently the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of the situation.We want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
