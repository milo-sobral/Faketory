Trade is not an event and we\u2019re having a continuous dialogue with our Chinese counterparts about a whole variety of products.\u201dLast week, Treasury Board President Scott Brison told the Globe and Mail the best way to move forward quickly with China on trade would be to focus on opportunities for immediate gains in areas such as food and agriculture.And indeed Canada has sector-by-sector targets, including an aim to double Canadian agricultural exports to China to $75 billion by 2025, Carr said. \u201cWe\u2019re well on our way to meeting those goals,\u201d he said.Brison\u2019s comments echoed those put forward by dozens of business experts in a recent Public Policy Forum paper, warning that a sweeping deal risks provoking the United States. President Donald Trump has been raising trade barriers with China.Canada\u2019s efforts to start formal free-trade talks with China stalled late last year after Chinese leaders bristled at a Canadian trade agenda that includes gender, labour and Indigenous rights.Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over a clause in the new United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement that allows any of the countries to withdraw from the deal on six months\u2019 notice if one of the partners enters a free-trade agreement with a non-market economy \u2014 language widely seen as referring to China.China questioned Canada about the USMCA during talks this week and was informed of the provision that could affect negotiations between China and any of the three USMCA countries, Carr said.A number of federal and provincial officials have been in China over the last week to talk trade and drum up import and export deals between Canadian and Chinese businesses. Canadian companies taking part in the China International Import Expo last week secured $1.67 billion in agreements.China\u2019s interest in so many Canadian products could ultimately lead to a comprehensive trade agreement, Carr said.Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who\u2019s also in China, said high-level economic and financial discussions this week between the two countries were productive, and those talks will continue regularly to keep the momentum going.But he also noted that while Canada is actively promoting itself as \u201copen for business\u201d with China, when it comes to state-owned enterprises looking to invest in Canadian companies, Canada will be cautious.\u201cWe will examine those investment to make sure there are no security or other challenges for the Canadian economy,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with the way other countries consider these investments.\u201dWe want to improve your reading experience"}
