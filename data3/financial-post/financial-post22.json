{"id": "Rate hikes to cost Canadian households $2,500 each year \u2014 but it isn't uncharted territory: reportEconomyTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 24, 20184:47 PM EDTCanadian debt holders \u2014 especially millennials \u2014 may see their savings and discretionary spending under pressure as the Bank of Canada announced it would be hiking interest rates to 1.75 per cent, according to an Environics Analytics study.Canada\u2019s central bank raised interest rates by a quarter point \u2014 marking the fifth time it has\u00a0 done so since the summer of July 2017. Canadian interest rates have remained relatively low since the global recession in 2008 as the bank attempted to stimulate the economy. But now the bank is more optimistic about the economy, pointing to the USMCA trade deal signed with the U.S. and Mexico on Sept. 30.Rising interest rates may mean that mortgage and non-mortgage debt-holders \u201care starting to feel the pinch,\u201d\u00a0Environics research associate Isanna Biglands and senior vice president of research and development Peter Miron wrote.\u201cOver the past 10 years Canadian debt holders haven\u2019t had much reason to fret about interest rates, but they may now,\u201d they wrote.In 2017, the average Canadian household only paid an additional $286 of their discretionary income \u2014 what\u2019s left of household income after deducting personal taxes, shelter and food. While most may not notice spending an additional 0.57 per cent, that number isn\u2019t completely accurate, according to the study. The full-year effect of the hikes actually means that Canadians would\u2019ve been spending, on average, an additional $686.When the 2018 hikes are taken into consideration, the average Canadian household will actually be spending an additional $1,715. The study notes, however, that the full effect of the hikes can only be determined after five years. In that event, the cost rises to $2,516 per household per year, which equals five per cent of discretionary income.The Bank of Canada says that while it\u2019s not dismissive of the difficult adjustment for those who will be renewing their mortgages at higher interest rates, it had been laying the ground for quite a while.\u201cIt\u2019s precisely why we have put in place a two percentage point stress test for getting a new mortgage,\u201d Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said at a press conference Wednesday. \u201cBecause everybody knew interest rates were lower than they would end up being, so it made perfect sense. We advocated it for quite a long time before it became practice \u2014 that people should be self testing.\u201dWhile baby boomers may see a boost in discretionary spending because of the rate hikes, millennials and members of Generation X may face the worst consequences. According to the study, debt holders that belong to mid-affluent suburban areas of Canada \u2014 social groups that the authors call \u201csuburban upscale diverse\u201d and \u201csuburban younger\u201d \u2014 will be impacted significantly.The study defines these areas as being of \u201cnew development on the edge of major cities,\u201d where most first-time homeowners and younger families would be living. Unlike baby boomers, millennials living in these areas haven\u2019t spent years building savings accounts.\u201cThese younger families have not had time to build up their capital and will find their consumption and savings rates pinched, particularly by the increased interest payments on their higher mortgage balances,\u201d Biglands and Miron wrote.Urban social groups, meanwhile, won\u2019t see much of a difference because of lower levels of home ownership. The groups that the study said is most \u201cinsulated\u201d from the rate hikes are those it defines as being Francophone. This is because the homes in these areas have appreciated very little over the years and as a result, owners haven\u2019t seen increased mortgage debts.It\u2019s not all bad, though, Biglands and Miron wrote. Higher interest rates are a sign of a stronger economy, which should in turn result in higher household incomes.\u201cAdditionally, even when fully factoring in the five interest rate increases observed so far, the debt service ratio is still only at pre-financial crisis levels; this is not uncharted territory,\u201d they wrote.Email: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77We want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
