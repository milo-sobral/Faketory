Here\u2019s a look at some of the proposals.Naming and shaming The chief watchdog for banking customers, the FCAC, has issued 131 decisions over the years, but the name of an offending bank hasn\u2019t been published since 2004, allowing for lenders to remain anonymous when they are taken to task for flouting consumer-protection rules.For instance, the group\u2019s latest ruling centred on a bank that \u201cfailed to provide accurate mortgage payment frequency information in a clear, simple and not misleading manner to its customers as required by the Cost of Borrowing Regulations,\u201d but the bank was never named.The new budget-implementation legislation, however, proposes amending the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act to state that, subject to any regulations, the FCAC commission \u201cshall\u201d make names public, instead of the current wording which gives it the option.\u201cIn making public the nature of a violation,\u201d the bill adds, \u201cthe Commissioner may include the reasons for his or her decision, including the relevant facts, analysis and considerations that formed part of the decision.\u201dAt the same time, the budget implementation bill is proposing to seriously crank up the level of fines the FCAC can impose on a bank, increasing it to a maximum of $10 million for a violation from the current limit of $500,000.Whistleblower protectionsBill C-86 could hand regulators and government another tool in uncovering misconduct, as it sets out protections for bankers thinking about turning whistleblower.According to the legislation, any employee, \u201cwho has reasonable grounds to believe that the bank, authorized foreign bank or any person has committed or intends to commit a wrongdoing,\u201d could report this to the proper authorities, which would be required to keep the employee\u2019s identity confidential.In addition, the legislation also proposes that a bank would not be allowed to fire any employee who has blown the whistle.Sales tacticsWhile the FCAC said it found no \u201cwidespread mis-selling\u201d at the banks, it did warn that a sales-heavy environment could increase the possibility of selling products or services to customers that may be incompatible with their needs.Bill C-86, however, explicitly states that a bank \u201cshall establish and implement policies and procedures to ensure that the products or services in Canada that it offers or sells to a natural person other than for business purposes are appropriate for the person having regard to their circumstances, including their financial needs.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the following section sets out that a financial institution shall make sure how it pays its officers and employees in Canada \u201cdoes not interfere with the person\u2019s ability to comply\u201d with those aforementioned policies and procedures.The bill also reiterates that, subject to any regulations, a bank would not be able to provide a person with a financial product or service without first obtaining their \u201cexpress consent,\u201d which must be asked for \u201cin a manner, and using language, that is clear, simple and not misleading.\u201d While similar language already exists in other regulations, Bill C-86 would enshrine it within the Bank Act itself.Regulatory reliefWhile Bill C-86 may place a greater regulatory burden on the retail side of the banking business, it could also remove some restrictions as well.One section of the bill would make it easier for banks to make smaller acquisitions or increase its investments in some businesses by allowing transactions below a certain threshold to proceed without requiring the approval of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.Clarification:An earlier version of this story referenced proposed measures banks would have to take to notify consumers upon closing a branch. Banks are already subject to such regulations \u2014 Bill C-68 proposed to include them directly in the Bank Act.\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne\u00a0We want to improve your reading experience"}
