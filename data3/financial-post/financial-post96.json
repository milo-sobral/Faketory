The strength of the Canadian dollar, which hit a four-month high in September, means that overseas earnings are not worth as much when they are converted back to the fund\u2019s domestic currency.The fund does not hedge against currency movements saying that while they may impact its results in the short-term, it does not expect them to have a significant impact on its long-term performance.In May, CPPIB reported an 11.6 per cent return on investments in its latest fiscal year but warned that double-digit growth was not sustainable with competition for assets intensifying.\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018We want to improve your reading experience"}
