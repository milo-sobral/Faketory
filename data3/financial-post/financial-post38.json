{"id": "Free trade in the age of Trump: Can Canada save the crumbling WTO?EconomyTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 23, 20183:17 PM EDTCanada will step back into a familiar role this week when it kick starts a 13-nation mission in Ottawa to help bridge the bitter impasse threatening to sink the beleaguered World Trade Organization.In the unwieldy 164-member club of the WTO, where solutions to larger problems often begin life in smaller, informal gatherings, Canada has frequently played the part of an influential middle power pushing for compromise.The question now, given U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s clear contempt for the central organ of the world\u2019s multilateral trading system, is how effective the approach will be this time around.The slow moving animal of the WTO is facing an urgent crisis as the United States continues to block the appointment of judges to its appellate body \u2014 or top court \u2014 an action that could leave it powerless by late next year.And the early Canadian suggestions for reform \u2014 outlined in a discussion paper provided ahead of this week\u2019s meetings \u2014 have already been criticized by Dennis Shea, the U.S. Ambassador to the WTO, for not taking a tough enough stand.\u201cI think the whole tenor of the paper is more trying to be a middle road kind of approach, like let\u2019s have more discussions, let\u2019s start a discussion,\u201d Shea said during an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies earlier this month. \u201cI think we\u2019re beyond that point. Yes, discussion is important, dialogue is important, but we need to get some actions in place.\u201dCanada\u2019s Minister\u00a0for International Trade Diversification Jim Carr, who will host the Ottawa meetings, remains undeterred. Any reform to the complex international organization will ultimately require broad consensus that is best accomplished \u201cincrementally, but also with purpose,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a sense of movement. There has to be a sense that we\u2019ve got to do better than we have done. There\u2019s lots of purpose and I\u2019m very hopeful it will take us to a place further along that path than we are now.\u201dThe meetings in Ottawa starting Wednesday will include senior ministers from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Union, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland.Crucially, they will not include China or the United States, a decision Carr has said is part of a strategy to first build consensus among countries that believe in a rules-based trading system before moving out to bring others on board.Present or not, the influence of the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2014 currently locked in a trade war in which tariffs on US$360 billion in goods have been exchanged \u2014 will undoubtedly loom large over the talks.You've got a bully of a Trump administration, you've got China and you've got a system that is collapsing and has actually become irrelevantU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the WTO, accusing it of treating the United States harshly while failing to address unfair trade practices by China, including its alleged use of industrial subsidies, its policies around state-owned enterprises and its requirements that companies hand over technology in exchange for market access.With the seven-member appellate body now down to three judges \u2014 the minimum required to hear WTO cases \u2014 continued American efforts to block appointments could soon render it paralyzed.That would leave countries without a mechanism to address trade disputes, paving the way for a proliferation of bilateral deals, the application of more tariffs and an overall breakdown of the system, trade experts warn.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bully of a Trump administration, you\u2019ve got China and you\u2019ve got a system that is collapsing and has actually become irrelevant,\u201d said Gregory Shaffer, director of the center on globalization, law and society at the University of California, Irvine.\u201cThe Trump administration is threatening tariffs and imposing tariffs, all of it in violation of WTO rules. So the system only exists in name right now and the question is how to make it effective at all.\u201dCanada\u2019s ideas for reform, described in the discussion paper, focus on three main issues. The first calls for improving the monitoring function of the WTO, under which members are required to notify the organization of how they are applying its rules and give other countries the opportunity to object. Another identifies the need to update aging trade rules and the framework for deciding what sorts of obligations developing countries are exempted from.The most contentious point tackled, give U.S. frustrations, is how to strengthen and safeguard the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system. Canada\u2019s suggestions include streamlining proceedings, excluding some issues from adjudication and using mediation in certain cases.Solving the impasse over the appointment of appellate body members \u2014 an issue that \u201cthreatens to bring the whole dispute settlement system to a halt\u201d according to the paper \u2014 will mean addressing concerns that its rulings have interpreted the rules in a way that has added to the obligations of members, it states.Canada\u2019s blueprint for change \u201caddresses everything the U.S. wants vis a vis China on substantive rules and is even open to curtailing the power of the appellate body,\u201d said Shaffer of UC Irvine.\u201cI think Canada is operating in the shadow of power. It is trying to position itself in a neutral, principled way here but of course in doing that it\u2019s going to address the U.S. concerns quite seriously because if you argue the U.S. is playing in bad faith you\u2019re not going to get anywhere. To make it effective you\u2019ve got to address the U.S. position, you\u2019ve got to play the broker and that\u2019s what Canada is trying to do.\u201dOttawa isn\u2019t the only force trying to organize a rewrite of the WTO\u2019s complex rulebook for global trade. The EU issued a separate blueprint for reform in September. Like Canada\u2019s submission, it calls for solving some disputes through \u201cplurilateral discussions\u201d involving smaller groups of interested players rather than by seeking unanimous approval of all member states. The U.S. has also engaged with the EU and Japan to develop new rules and methods of enforcement.A key difference among the proposals comes back to the Canadian approach, which stands in contrast to the top-down efforts of the Trump administration, says Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at the School of Policy Studies at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston.We'd done all the easy liberalization and what we were then asking was to do the hard stuff and nobody wants to do the hard stuff\u201cThe Americans want to say we\u2019ve got a good idea and we\u2019re going to use our weight to get everyone to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, Canada\u2019s not big enough to say \u2018we have the solution, do it\u2019 but that wouldn\u2019t be our way anyway and I don\u2019t think that would work. China isn\u2019t going to change how it governs state-owned enterprises because you tell them to. It\u2019s going to do it by working with you and coming to the conclusion that the way they manage state-owned enterprises isn\u2019t working for them and is causing problems for other people.\u201dThe more the dispute between the U.S. and China intensifies, the harder it could become to achieve a compromise on key issues. That adds to the urgency of the situation and also makes excluding the two superpowers from this week\u2019s talks a reasonable decision, said Simon Lester, a trade policy analyst at Washington\u2019s Cato Institute.\u201cWhen you have these big powers going at each other like the U.S. and China are, I think its reasonable to think well, you\u2019re not going to get to a solution with them in the room,\u201d Lester said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly reasonable and sensible approach to try and do it this way. Whether it has a chance for success, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s certainly worth considering and I don\u2019t have any other great proposals for what to do about the current situation.\u201dShea has credited the \u201cdisruptively constructive leadership\u201d of the U.S. for prompting a renewed interest in WTO reform that many countries acknowledge is necessary. The WTO and its post-war predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are credited with lowering tariffs and increasing global trade volumes \u2014 a dynamic economists credit with reducing poverty and lifting living standards. However, in recent decades, the pace of liberalization has slowed and failed to address newer areas of trade including services.\u201cIf you look at the WTO after 1995, not a whole lot got done\u201d said Lester. \u201cThrow Trump into the mix and it all looks a lot more chaotic and confrontational but it was already really difficult. We\u2019d done all the easy liberalization and what we were then asking was to do the hard stuff and nobody wants to do the hard stuff.\u201dBut part of the challenge in charting a path for reform is determining exactly what changes the U.S. wants, he added. Despite deriding various aspects of the WTO, he said, the U.S. has put forward few concrete proposals for how they should be overhauled.\u201cArguably it\u2019s just a negotiating strategy where they make everybody so concerned that they\u2019ll be willing to give the U.S. everyone what they want. Maybe you can look to the NAFTA experience as a guide. The changes to NAFTA weren\u2019t earth shattering. Maybe we\u2019ll go in the same direction at the WTO but it\u2019s not clear how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201d\u2022 Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: Naomi_PowellWe want to improve your reading experienceCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
