As domestically sensitive U.S. segments like homebuilders and regional banks have tread water over the past week, the Nasdaq 100 Index has fallen nearly 5 per cent.It\u2019s pushed the spread between the Cboe NDX Volatility Index and the Cboe Volatility Index close to the highest levels of the year. The former measures the implied volatility of the Nasdaq 100 over the next month, while the latter does the same for the S&P 500.Catching a falling knife in tech will be hard. Not only have positive catalysts \u2014 like the highest beat rate on earnings this reporting season \u2014 failed to buoy shares, but it\u2019s also tough to know just where investors can be confident the selling will abate based on the fundamentals.\u201cUnlike industrials or materials stocks, there isn\u2019t any clear \u2018valuation floor\u2019 for tech,\u201d said Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of how much you\u2019re willing to pay up for growth.\u201dThe Nasdaq 100\u2019s forward price-to-earnings premium relative to the S&P 500 is near its lowest levels of 2018. But even after this narrowing, it would still make for the biggest valuation gap compared to the prior three years.\u201cWe saw for over two years how the market bowed at the altar of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook,\u201d said Dave Roberts, a Washington-based independent trader of volatility options and products. \u201cBreadth was weak, signs of deterioration showed up almost everywhere, yet it was all covered up by five stocks. Now, they\u2019re broken.\u201dMandy Xu, chief equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, contrasts the relatively low level of implied and realized correlation among S&P 500 members with the opposite in tech stocks.\u201cDespite the sharp correction over the past month, we\u2019re still trading at below average levels of correlation and about 35 points below where correlations typically trade in a large S&P 500 drawdown environment,\u201d she writes. Meanwhile, the implied correlation among Nasdaq 100 constituents has seen \u201ca significant surge over the past week, up 15 points to 55 per cent indicating more widespread concern over the sector\u2019s outlook.\u201dRealized correlation among the stocks in Goldman Sachs VIP basket of hedge fund longs has also more than quadrupled over the past month, she added. That\u2019s a sign some of the carnage is driven by the community checking out from hedge fund hotels.At the same time, signs that the pendulum has swung too far away from risk assets has some on Wall Street sniffing out an ideal buying opportunity.Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, notes that the realized swings in the S&P 500 compared to a basket of low-volatility stocks from the benchmark gauge has reached \u201crisk aversion extremes.\u201dFor the Nasdaq 100, the spread is even wider \u2014 the most since 2009.\u201cOnce we hit a risk aversion extreme, the trend usually reverses itself over the next 1-3 months with the market rewarding \u2018risk-on\u2019 stocks over \u2018risk aversion\u2019 names,\u201d writes Harvey. \u201cCurrent vol spread levels support our view that now is the time to take on risk.\u201dSome of his high-quality recommendations within the Nasdaq 100 include Facebook, Microsoft, PayPal and Nvidia.Bloomberg.comThis content was provided by Market One for commercial purposes."}
