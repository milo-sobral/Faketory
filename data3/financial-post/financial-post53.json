Power Corp. entities previously spent $240 million on fintech companies.\u201cWhat brings together all of the investors is that they view the financial services industry as being ripe for change and they want to be positioned to take advantage of that change,\u201d said Portag3 co-Founder and Executive Chairman Paul Desmarais III, the son of Power Corp.\u2019s co-chief executive officer Paul Desmarais Jr.Desmarais said the fintech companies Portag3 invests in are giving Power Corp. a window into the latest trends in tech and consumer adoption. In exchange, they benefit from the global company\u2019s deep pockets and extensive network. Power Corp. has already deployed $165 million from its first funding round into Wealthsimple, a robo-adviser that targets millennial investors.Increased competition in the wealth-management industry and a decade of low interest rates have taken a toll on the shares of Power Corp., which controls some of Canada\u2019s biggest insurance and mutual-fund businesses. While looking for large acquisitions to spur growth, it\u2019s using its foray into fintech as a way to force its own companies, such as Great-West Lifeco Inc. and IGM Financial Inc., to improve their digital services.While a direct competitor to some of Power\u2019s wealth-management companies, Wealthsimple tends to attract younger customers who distrust established players. Wealthsimple manages $3 billion in assets for more than 100,000 clients.As a controlling shareholder, Power supports Wealthsimple\u2019s plans to go public in the future, according to Desmarais.\u201cOur goal is to create a global category leader based in Canada, and I think we\u2019re well on our way to doing that,\u201d he said in an interview.Portag3\u2019s strategy is to inject cash in early stages, help the start-ups grow and stay for the long term, according to Desmarais. The new fund will focus on Europe and North America and take higher stakes than the initial fund, Desmarais said.\u201cI believe that in fintech you need a minimum of 10 years to see winners emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to accompany companies through that cycle.\u201dFintech services haven\u2019t fully bloomed in Canada, where only 18 per cent of people say they are regular users, well below the 33 per cent global average and China\u2019s 69 per cent, according to a report by accounting firm EY. Canadian banks have taken a collaborative approach with startups to make their own operations more efficient and add features for customers who are increasingly using mobile devices and computers for routine banking.\u2013With assistance from Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.comWe want to improve your reading experience"}
