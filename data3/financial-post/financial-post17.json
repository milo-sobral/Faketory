{"id": "Stocks tumble as sentiment suddenly soursInvestingTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 18, 20184:20 PM EDTA risk-off tone gripped global financial markets, with U.S. stocks sliding while Treasuries climbed with the yen on demand for havens.American equities fell the most since last week\u2019s rout as investors fretted over the U.S.-China trade war\u2019s impact on economic growth, the Italian debt crisis and rising interest rates. High-flying technology shares again led the sell-off, while defensive sectors like utilities and real estate fared better. Mixed earnings, with disappointments from key industrial and tech names, added to investor anxiety.The S&P 500 slid back toward its 200-day moving average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 300 points and the Nasdaq 100\u2019s rout topped 2 per cent.The weakness comes after China sank overnight, bringing losses in its major benchmark to 30 per cent since January highs. The dollar touched the highest in more than a week, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.17 percent. Italy\u2019s yield spread over Germany\u2019s hit the highest level since 2013 as European Union officials questioned the country\u2019s budget plan.\u201cLike every other spurt of volatility, it\u2019s hard to give an exact reason, but we have all the usual culprits: concern about global trade, earnings season and companies potentially staring down the barrel of another tariff maybe over the winter,\u201d said Kevin Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s a hodgepodge. You have all these things that come together at the same time.\u201dEarnings remain in focus though the depth of the sell-off overshadowed most major reports. Weak results from Germany\u2019s SAP and Taiwan Semiconductor dragged American tech indexes lower. Earnings misses from several U.S. industrial firms and a Bank of America downgrade of the housing sector fueled worries that higher interest rates and the trade war are hitting profits. Philip Morris surged on strong demand, buoying consumer shares.Here are some key events for the rest of this week:Third-quarter GDP for China comes Friday in addition to last month\u2019s retail sales and factory output.These are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index declined 1.4 per cent as of 4 p.m. New York time, the most since Oct. 11.
