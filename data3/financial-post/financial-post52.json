We aren\u2019t just bargaining for today, we are bargaining for the future \u2014 for our members and everyone who relies on the postal service.\u201dLast Tuesday, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu appointed Morton Mitchnick, a former chair of the Ontario Labour Relations Board, to help the two parties resolve their contract differences.We want to improve your reading experience"}
