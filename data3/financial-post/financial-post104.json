Some digital asset industry pundits have already begun referring to it as the crypto winter.Bloomberg Intelligence says the drama\u2019s just starting. Analysts predict the price could fall to US$1,500, which would indicate another drop of more than 70 per cent from current levels. The digital token tumbled 12 per cent on Wednesday alone to its lowest level in over a year, and has lost more than 60 per cent of its value so far this year. Many of Bitcoin\u2019s closest peers, including XRP, the cryptocurrency also known as Ripple, fell in tandem.\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well last night,\u201d Travis Kling, founder of the hedge fund Ikigai, said on Thursday as he tracked the Bitcoin Cash split. \u201cThere\u2019s a small chance that, it\u2019s difficult to estimate, that something really bad could happen related to Bitcoin Cash that could then impact the entire crypto market.\u201dSome investors believe that two versions of Bitcoin Cash, which had broken off the original Bitcoin in 2017, could be sucking investment and miners away from the largest cryptocurrency.That rang true to Mike McGlone, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who warned that the slide could get much worse.The slump \u201cwas sparked by the pump for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork,\u201d said McGlone. \u201cThat pump that began a few weeks ago, got the market a bit too offsides with speculative longs playing for the good-old days. But this is an enduring bear market.\u201dThe bad news didn\u2019t stop there. Chipmakers were also hammered Friday as Nvidia Corp. issued weak sales forecasts for the current quarter, saying that it saw lingering loss of demand from the collapse of cryptocurrency mining. The mining of digital tokens, computer code that carries value in online transactions, had helped stoke demand for the company\u2019s graphics chips. Shortages related to a spike in demand from miners led to an oversupply of parts when the crypto market crashed.\u201cThe drop in the stock price of Nvidia is reflective of a future where cryptocurrency fuelled demand has cratered,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, president and co-chief investment officer of Creative Planning, in an email. \u201cWhile this is, of course, bad news for Nvidia, it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201dNelson Saiers, a former hedge fund manager turned artist, is hoping the renewed focus will help raise the profile of his work \u2014 he\u2019s installing inflatable Bitcoin rats in London and Washington to showcase the token\u2019s influence on society.\u201cThey exist without permission. They are hated, hunted and persecuted,\u201d he said about rats, which serve as a proxy for Bitcoin in his art. \u201cAnd yet they are capable of bringing entire civilizations to their knees.\u201dOr maybe just those who bet big on cryptocurrencies.Bloomberg.com"}
