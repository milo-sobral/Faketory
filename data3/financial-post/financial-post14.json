If at some stage of the game we enter into a conversation about a full free-trade agreement, we will inform our North American partners as we are obliged to do,\u201d said Carr.\u201cBut it does not constrain us in continuing to deepen our ties with China, or any other nation in the world.\u201dCarr says the clause is \u201creciprocal\u201d and applies to the U.S. and Mexico as well. If Canada does enter into free-trade talks with China, it will duly inform the North American partners, he added.\u201cAnd if our partners don\u2019t like it, they have the capacity to bolt from the agreement, just as they do now.\u201dCarr noted the current North American Free Trade Agreement as well as the newly negotiated USMCA have a broad termination clause that allows any party to leave the agreement, for any reason, by giving six months\u2019 notice.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa has blasted inclusion of the new clause, saying it targets China\u2019s potential trading partners and unfairly brands it as a non-market economy.Trade experts and analysts support the careful approach Carr is advocating because it gives Canada room to talk to China, without overtly angering the U.S.The U.S. is embroiled in a trade war with China that has seen the imposition of hundreds of billions dollars of tariffs by the Trump administration on Chinese goods and retaliation by Beijing.We want to improve your reading experience"}
