Last week, a pipe bomb was delivered to his house in Westchester County, New York. It was one of 14 explosives sent to people who are regularly disparaged by the right. Authorities have charged an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump with sending the bombs.On Oct. 22, Johnston shared a Twitter post about the caravan, adding a comment in which he said, \u201cSee those vans on the right? What you don\u2019t see are the troop carriers and the rail cars taking them north. @OpenSociety planned and is executing this, including where they defecate. And they have an army of American immigration lawyers waiting at the border.\u201dCampbell Soup said in a statement Monday that Johnston had been scheduled to leave the company in early November. \u201cIn the last few days, the company and Mr. Johnston agreed that under the current circumstances it would be best to accelerate the timing of his departure,\u201d the company added.Johnston\u2019s last day was Thursday, the company said.The Open Society said in a Twitter message last week, \u201cMr. Johnston, neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society is funding this effort. We are surprised to see a @CampbellSoupCo executive spreading false stories. We do support the historic U.S. commitment to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands.\u201dKeith R. McLoughlin, Campbell Soup\u2019s interim chief executive, wrote to Patrick Gaspard, president of Open Society Foundations, last week to tell him that Johnston\u2019s remarks did not represent the company\u2019s position and were \u201cinconsistent with how Campbell approaches public debate.\u201d\u201cWe regret that this episode happened and has coloured his service to us,\u201d McLoughlin said in the letter, which was dated Oct. 23.Soros founded Open Society more than 30 years ago to promote democracy and human rights. He made his fortune running a hedge fund and has donated to Democratic candidates in the United States and to liberal causes.Soros has been a target of anger from right-wing groups and of anti-Semitic smears. Roseanne Barr, whose television show was cancelled by ABC after she posted a racist message on Twitter, is among those who have spread far-right conspiracy theories about Soros, accusing him of being a Nazi and wanting to overthrow the U.S. government.The conspiracy theories about Soros have been spread against a backdrop of increasing hostility toward Jews in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League said there was a 57 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States last year compared with 2016.On Saturday, a man who told police that he \u201cwanted all Jews to die\u201d killed 11 people in a rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue.Other executives and officials have run afoul of their employers over comments on social media. In one prominent instance, CBS fired a company lawyer, Hayley Geftman-Gold, last year after she said on Facebook that the victims of a mass shooting in Las Vegas were \u201cRepublican gun toters\u201d who did not deserve sympathy.The New York TimesCalculate your monthly mortgage paymentsCompare payments and other costs associated with getting a new mortgageBegin the process of finding out how much you can borrowSee how much you have left to save and where your money is being spentSee how much your investment savings could be worthWhat will it take to help reach your savings goalsCompare currencies from across the globeCalculate what it will take you to save one million dollars"}
