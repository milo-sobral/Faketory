In fact, the policy rate today is still negative in real terms, that is, once you adjust for inflation,\u201d said Poloz.\u201cThe policy rate will need to rise to neutral to achieve our inflation target,\u201d he added.The overall annual inflation rate was close to the bank\u2019s 2 per cent target, he said, while noting there could be further volatility in coming months.\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2018We want to improve your reading experience"}
