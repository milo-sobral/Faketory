{"id": "Federal deficit came in at $19 billion last year, final report on 2017-18 spending showsEconomyTop Stories", "paragraph": "October 19, 201810:12 AM EDTLast UpdatedOctober 19, 201812:18 PM EDTOTTAWA \u2014 The federal government ran a shortfall of $19 billion in the last fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the previous year, Ottawa\u2019s annual financial report card shows.The deficit for 2017-18 was slightly smaller than the federal government predicted in February\u2019s budget.However, the Finance Department\u2019s fiscal monitor estimated in May the federal books would post a deficit of just $16.2 billion for last year.To confuse matters, the government says it has changed the way it calculates its pension liability \u2014 a fix officials say has been at the top of the list for auditors for years. And that led to revisions of 10 years\u2019 worth of budget numbers.As a result, the slim surplus Conservatives left with much fanfare in 2014-15 is now noted as a small deficit.Tax revenues rose year-over-year, but it was less a windfall than what officials described as a \u201cnew normal\u201d after the Liberals created a new tax bracket for high-income earners. The Finance Department says there was a $9.9-billion increase in personal tax revenue from the previous year.Beyond 2017-18, Morneau\u2019s February budget predicted an $18.1-billion shortfall for this fiscal year \u2014 a number that\u2019s expected to gradually shrink to $12.3 billion in 2022-23, including annual $3-billion cushions to offset risks.Following the 2015 election, the Liberal government abandoned campaign pledges to run annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to balance the books in four years \u2014 by 2019.Instead, Morneau has been focused on reducing the net debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 also known as the debt burden \u2014 each year. After the pension-related revisions were taken into account, the debt ratio dropped to 31.3 per cent of GDP in 2017-18, from 32.0 per cent a year earlier.The latest numbers for 2017-18 pushed the overall national debt to $671.3 billion.The document didn\u2019t provide a long-term outlook for the debt burden, but officials say internal projections still show the measure on a downward track, even if the numbers have shifted slightly due to accounting changes.Morneau has cited a weaker-than-expected economy for the bigger shortfalls as well as a need to make investments to lift Canada\u2019s long-term growth.But the economy has delivered a strong performance for more than a year and the lack of a road map to return to balance has drawn criticism, particularly from the opposition Conservatives.There are concerns over the Liberals\u2019 deficit-spending plan at a time of economic expansion and warnings it could find itself far deeper down the deficit hole in the event of a recession.We want to improve your reading experience"}
