He was previously chief compliance officer at K2, the commissioners were told.Daniel Gosselin, K2\u2019s president, settled for sanctions including a $20,000 penalty, a 6-month prohibition on trading, and a five-year prohibition on becoming or acting as a chief compliance officer or ultimate designated person at an investment firm.Separately, K2 paid a penalty of $400,000, as well as costs of $30,000.Raphael Eghan, counsel for staff of the OSC, said the agreed sanctions were acceptable to address the \u201cserious conduct\u201d because they would \u201csend a powerful deterrence message\u201d to K2 and its principals, as well as anyone else considering engaging in manipulative trading.Between October and December of 2016, Kimel and Gosselin engaged in trading on behalf of their funds that contributed to a \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d impression about the supply or demand for derivatives listed on the Montreal Exchange, which allowed them to trade at \u201cartificial prices,\u201d according to an agreed statement of facts set out in the settlement agreement.\u201cThrough their misconduct, the Respondents wrongly benefitted by approximately $250,000,\u201d said the document, which was made public following the OSC\u2019s acceptance of the settlement agreement.There were about 60 incidents of the \u201cimpugned trading,\u201d also known as spoofing.In some cases, as described in the document, Kimel would place direct electronic access (DEA) orders to buy or sell small quantities of certain options, which would increase of decrease the national best bid and offer \u201cto the advantage of K2.\u201dGosselin would then initiate a chat session with one or more Canadian financial institutions and negotiate a larger desk trade on the opposite side of the order entered by Kimel. Very soon after the desk trade was confirmed, \u201coften within seconds,\u201d the DEA order previously entered would be cancelled, the settlement agreement says.There were about 60 incidents of the 'impugned trading' According to the document, \u201cKimel and Gosselin coordinated their conduct regarding the Spoofing Events. In certain circumstances, Gosselin would notify Kimel when the desk trade had been successfully negotiated so that Kimel could quickly cancel his DEA order.\u201dThe settlement agreement noted that K2 and its two principals had no prior record of securities regulatory misconduct and that they had cooperated with OSC staff at all times during the investigation. It was also noted that there was no harm to retail investors, since the counterparties to the trades were \u201csophisticated institutional derivatives traders.\u201dThe document says K2 offered to compensate a counterparty to the trading, but that offer was declined.Kimel and Gosselin were subject to \u201cinternal sanctions\u201d including a three-month ban on options trading for Kimel, and a three-month ban on all trading for Gosselin, according to the settlement agreement. They were also required to complete a trader training course program.As part of their settlement with the OSC, Kimel and Gosselin will have to have all trades preapproved by K2\u2019s chief compliance officer for a period of 18 and 12 months, respectively, after their prohibition on trading ends.Despite their trading prohibitions, the settlement agreement says Kimel and Gosselin will be permitted to redeem units of The K2 Principal Fund LP, \u201cin which they have sole legal and beneficial ownership.\u201d\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPostWe want to improve your reading experience"}
