Now, the Tories say they intend on abandoning this plan.A press release from the\u00a0Canadian Federation of Independent Business said they were pleased with the move, saying that Ontario\u2019s decision makes it the first province to formally announce that it would not match Ottawa on the tax change.\u201cIt is critical that the province maintain every tool possible to ensure small business competitiveness, and that includes access to the small business tax rate,\u201d\u00a0said Plamen Petkov, CFIB\u2019s Ontario vice-president, in the release.Under the watch of Premier Ford, Ontario would also no longer \u201cstand in the way\u201d of pipelines transporting oil to or through the province from Western Canada, the update said.\u201cIn every way possible,\u201d it added, \u201cOntario will support its partners looking to expand oil distribution, and at the same time, protect their competitiveness from the federal carbon tax.\u201dFord is not proposing to diverge from the Liberals in every way, as the update says Ontario will \u201crespect\u201d the recent Supreme Court of Canada ruling that was supportive of a co-operative national securities regulator.In addition, Thursday\u2019s update said that the Ford government is proposing to amend provincial legislation to allow for the regulation of financial benchmarks in Canada, such as the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate. Both moves had been raised under Ontario\u2019s former Liberal government.The Liberals had also projected in their spring budget that Ontario would have a $6.7-billion deficit for 2018-19. But Ford\u2019s government had ordered up an independent inquiry into the province\u2019s finances after winning a majority in June\u2019s election, which pegged the estimated deficit for 2018-19 at $15 billion.The fall update now claims that the Tories have already managed to cut into that shortfall with some of their policies, and are now projecting a $14.5-billion deficit for 2018-19. When the province would return to a balanced budget under Ford, or if it would this term, remains to be seen.\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodneWe want to improve your reading experience"}
