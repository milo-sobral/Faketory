{"id": "Ariana Grande Says Pete Davidson Turned Her Heart Black", "paragraph": "The emoji queen opens up about her fave black heart...Ariana Grande loves her emojis, let it be known.Whether it's the rain drop for 'No Tears Left To Cry' or her go-to cloud, the pop superstar lets her emoji choices do a lot of the talking a lot of the time, and her current\u00a0favourite is revealing a lot about her recent break-up with Pete Davidson.If you haven't already noticed, she has been a frequent user of the black heart emoji on social media as of late, often using it in place of any words and also to promote her record-breaking single 'thank u, next'.\nWhat does it mean, though? Some investigative fans quizzed their idol on the meaning behind it all, and the answer was a lot sadder than they probably hoped for.A fan on Twitter asked the singer \"Is the black heart some sort of tea or am i reaching?\" to which she initially just confirmed they were reaching, saying \"u reachin reachin baby.\"Just seconds later, however, she replied again to say\u00a0\"Jk i'm empty and my heart is black now so.\" Welp.Ariana has had a tough few months, which is well acknowledged enough to delve into, and has spoken openly online about her mental health.jk i\u2019m empty and my heart is black now soShe recently praised therapy for saving her life several times and has joked about the irony of releasing 'No Tears Left to Cry' earlier this year, so while this humour isn't new we do hope that she is alright underneath it all.If we know anything about Miss Grande, it's that she definitely does not have a black heart.We love you, queen!"}
