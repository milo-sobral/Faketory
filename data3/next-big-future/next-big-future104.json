Aerojet Rocketdyne, Exquadrum, and Sierra Nevada Corporation have been given contracts.OpFires seeks to develop innovative propulsion solutions that will enable a mobile, ground-launched tactical weapons delivery system capable of carrying a variety of payloads to a variety of ranges. Phase 1 of the program will be a 12-month effort focused on early development and demonstration of booster solutions that provide variable thrust propulsion across robust operational parameters in large tactical missiles.\u201cOpFires represents a critical capability development in support of the Army\u2019s investments in long-range precision fires,\u201d says DARPA\u2019s OpFires program manager, Maj. Amber Walker (U.S. Army). \u201cThese awards are the first step in the process to deliver this capability in support of U.S. overmatch.\u201dThe OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility for future tactical operating environments. Phase 2 will mature designs and demonstrate performance with hot/static fire tests targeted for late 2020. Phase 3, which will focus on weapon system integration, will culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests in 2022.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tControlling genome editing with nanomagnets \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab Photonic signaling for multi-chip modules "}
