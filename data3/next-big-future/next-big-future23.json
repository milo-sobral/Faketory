China\u2019s military budget will be about double in 2030. China would match US fighter jet production quantities around 2025. China might shift to mostly stealth jet production sometime around 2030. China\u2019s stealth jet production is highly uncertain as production is just starting. China does not announce production plans or force levels.The US has more jet fighter deliveries than China and Russia combined and the US has far more fifth-generation stealth fighters.China has about 700 4th generation fighters today and about 25 fifth generation fighters.\nChina could have 1100 4th generation fighters and about 60-120 fifth generation fighters in 2025.\nChina could have 1200-1600 4th generation fighters and 200-500 5th generation fighters in 2030.The US has about 450 fifth generation fighters today (F-22 and F-35s).\nThe US air force has about 1500 F-16s and F15s.
