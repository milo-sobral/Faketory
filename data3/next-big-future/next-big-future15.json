A 50-kilowatt laser should destroy low-end drones in less than a second and be able to stop incoming drones of swarms before they get through.The Army is developing a 100 kW laser mounted on a larger Oshkosh FMTV truck with about 5 to 10 tons of payload capacity.The 100-kilowatt laser trucks would be the second line of defense after the Strykers with 50-kilowatt lasers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOvzon fourth client SpaceX Falcon Heavy launches \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab USA number one in economic competitiveness for the first time in ten years "}
