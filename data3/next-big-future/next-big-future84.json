Category 3 requires as few as three successful flights and as many as 14 depending on the level of access given to NASA officials. The more access NASA has, the more likely officials are to certify a rocket with fewer successful launches under its belt.The Falcon 9 Block 5 has flown six successful missions \u2013 four from the Space Coast and two from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Including previous versions of Falcon 9, however, boosts that number to 60 missions with only one post-launch failure.\u201cLSP Category 3 certification is a major achievement for the Falcon 9 team and represents another key milestone in our close partnership with NASA,\u201d SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said Thursday in a company-released statement. \u201cWe are honored to have the opportunity to provide cost-effective and reliable launch services to the country\u2019s most critical scientific payloads.\u201dFalcon 9 has already boosted high-priority science payloads, such as this year\u2019s launch of NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, and the internationally developed JASON-3 satellite. Both were managed by LSP and were Category 2 missions.Moving forward, the certification will likely mean NASA and other agencies consider Falcon 9 for more complex and costly science missions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrbital Kinetic Bombardment gets close to nuclear on damage and cost \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab Asia will be over half of the world economy in 2028 "}
