Based on the data, the researchers estimated that the use of bitcoins in the year 2017 emitted 69 million metric tons of CO2.Researchers also studied how other technologies have been adopted by society, and created scenarios to estimate the cumulative emissions of Bitcoin should it grow at the rate that other technologies have been incorporated.The team found that if Bitcoin is incorporated, even at the slowest rate at which other technologies have been incorporated, its cumulative emissions will be enough to warm the planet above 2oC in just 22 years. If incorporated at the average rate of other technologies, it is closer to 16 years.\u201cCurrently, the emissions from transportation, housing and food are considered the main contributors to ongoing climate change. This research illustrates that Bitcoin should be added to this list,\u201d said Katie Taladay, a UH M\u0101noa PhD student and coauthor of the paper.\u201cWe cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, but if implemented at a rate even close to the slowest pace at which other technologies have been incorporated, it will spell very bad news for climate change and the people and species impacted by it,\u201d said Camilo Mora, associate professor of geography in the College of Social Sciences at UH M\u0101noa and lead author of the study.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnimal populations have dropped by 60% according to Wildlife report \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab High-performance solar cells with lower cost "}
