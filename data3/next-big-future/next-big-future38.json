As the biggest fleet of aircraft in the Army and widely relied on by the Department of Defense, Drozeski said the Black Hawk is the ideal platform for ALIAS to quickly benefit service partners.\u201cWe\u2019ve chosen the Black Hawk as the platform we want to demonstrate full integration of ALIAS-type capabilities \u2013 all the circuit breakers and switches and instruments in the aircraft, so that the capability ALIAS provides to a crew member is really like a co-pilot,\u201d said Drozeski. \u201cIt can fly routes, plan routes, execute emergency procedures, and do all that perfectly.\u201dHighlights of ALIAS\u2019 flexible architecture include:The potential for integration onto multiple fixed and rotary-wing platforms, both military and commercial;\nCockpit displays and human interfaces that support reduced workload and/or reduced crew, as well as improved safety, such as terrain avoidance;\nFull coverage of typical aircrew tasks and emergency procedures;\nThe ability to integrate directly with existing air vehicle systems, subsystems, and mission payloads;\nRedundancy and software assurance to support certification for human occupancy; and\nThe ability to rapidly integrate new applications including third-party algorithms and applications onto existing aircraft.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChina space program will get busy with moon missions and a space station \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab Boeing will spend 35% of military purchase in Israel "}
