Elon has said they will add more thermal protection to the upper stage. They will see what the least amount of mass necessary to return the upper stage in a condition that is reusable. Elon is confident reusability can be achieved. However, effort and focus is on the BFR.Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2018Won\u2019t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can\u2019t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWind tunnel and lasers for US hypersonic development \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab China Large Stealth Drone better than US RQ-170 drone "}
