{"id": "NASA funds improvement of Miralon to double CNT composite strength\nNextBigFuture.com\n", "paragraph": "NASA awarded a potential $8.1 million dollar contract to Nanocomp Technologies, now part of Huntsman,  for the \u201ccontinued improvement of manufacturing high-strength CNT yarn/tape for use in developing CNT composites with strength properties at least double that of carbon fiber composites in use today. Successful improvement of this nanotechnology that could enable lighter spacecraft and launch vehicles, making spaceflight and exploration more affordable.October 29, 2018, will have technology demonstrations of:* Next-generation yarn production\n* Miralon as a heat shield for space, aircraft and automotive applications\n* Furnaces producing sheet and yarn product\n* Miralon heated furniture and fixtures\n* Miralon yarn as a wire for lightingMiralon\u00ae is a continuous interconnected network of extremely long carbon tubes that does not require cross-linking or use of binders. Miralon is produced as sheets, yarn, and dispersed products. It is on the scale of millimeters (1mm-10mm) versus micrometers and classified by the EPA as an article, not a particle, which makes for safe handling. Miralon exploits many of the remarkable properties of individual CNTs spanning the electrical, mechanical, and thermal domains successfully at application scale.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA, China and Russia Military Jet Production and estimates for 2030 \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab MaZee and Crypto PR Lab Join to Provide Bundled Blockchain Marketing Services "}
