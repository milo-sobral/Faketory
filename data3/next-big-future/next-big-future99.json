Successfully completing the airport tunnel will make the tunneling company worth as much as $16 billion. This valuation will be before any full speed hyperloop implementation.In June 2018, Boring Company was selected as the contractor for a high-speed downtown-O\u2019Hare transport line. A Berenberg analyst has stated that the Boring Co. could be worth as much as $16 billion if it completes the project.The $16 billion estimate for the Boring Company\u2019s potential valuation was taken from the figures of the Channel Tunnel project, which connects England and France. This will add to the total valuation of Tesla. The electric car and energy company will be a key supplier for the high-speed transport line.Tesla would be designing and manufacturing the Boring Company\u2019s pods for the downtown Chicago-O\u2019Hare transport line.Musk said 18-mile high-speed tunnel would cost ~$1 billion to build. The Boring Co.\u2019s pods are designed to carry 16 passengers at a time.
