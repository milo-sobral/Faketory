They used a pair of modified F/A-18E/F Super Hornets using a combination of the powerful DTP-N processor, TTNT high-speed IP-based data-network and the long-wave Block II Infrared Search and Track (IRST) pod.The U.S. Navy will roll out new counter-stealth capabilities in the coming years as the Block III Super Hornet enters service in 2022. Russia and the Chinese possess the individual elements of all the required technologies to replicate the U.S. Navy\u2019s capabilities.The U.S. Air Force expects China and Russia to have effective anti-stealth around 2030.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSolid State battery for Dyson electric car \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab China could solve population problem with millions of IVF babies "}
