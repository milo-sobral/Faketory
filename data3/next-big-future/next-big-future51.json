A decade ago Chinese companies had success with \u201cCopying to China\u201d what worked elsewhere. Now others have success with \u201cCopy From China\u201d. Chinese companies adopted the business models of established US technology and internet companies.They are replicating\nTencent Holdings\u2019 WeChat super-app model,\nAlibaba\u2019s Taobao e-commerce model and\nAlipay\u2019s innovation of escrow payments for e-commerce transactions among others.Mobile-first business model were first pioneered in China. Mobile-first is becoming popular in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is at a similar stage of internet connectivity as China was a decade ago. Both regions have high mobile penetration rates. Singapore-based mobile classifieds platform Carousell pioneered the \u201csnap, list, sell\u201d model to sell second-hand items, earlier this year launched CarouPay, a payment system within its app that serves as an escrow service. If a buyer makes payment through CarouPay, the funds are held by the third party until the buyer has received the item, whereupon payment is then released to the seller.This model is similar to the strategy that Alibaba took with building its e-commerce empire, where it launched Alipay as a payment and escrow service to improve trust between buyers and sellers on its Taobao e-commerce platform. Alipay\u2019s escrow service is widely credited with increasing the popularity of the Chinese e-commerce platform as it created greater confidence between buyers and sellers in China\u2019s generally low-trust society.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead next:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2009 Honduran constitutional crisis and today \u00bb\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00ab More tariffs and more tax cuts for China "}
