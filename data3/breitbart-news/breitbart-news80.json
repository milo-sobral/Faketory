{"id": "Victor Davis Hanson: Macron Wants \u2018European Union Army,\u2019 Can\u2019t Make NATO Payments", "paragraph": "Hanson reflected on Macron\u2019s Sunday remarks at the centennial commemoration of World War I\u2019s armistice in Paris, France, where the French leader said, \u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is treason.\u201dHanson said, \u201cI was kind of shocked, because here the host was taking the occasion to pose as Europe\u2019s next leader by basically attacking not only Eastern European leaders, but Trump with his nationalist point, and then framing a hyper-fascist nationalist like Petain, who not only, you could argue about his behavior in World War I, good and bad, but he was the leader of French fascist nationalism in World War II, and yet Macron, historically illiterate, starts to praise him while he\u2019s attacking Trump.\u201dLISTEN:Hanson continued, \u201cAnd then [Emmanuel Macron] adds insult to injury by talking about, on the eve of the trip, how he\u2019s going to create a European Union army, and it\u2019s going to be used to protect France and Europe from not just China and Russia, but the United States, and yet he wants the United States to come over and commemorate coming in World War I and saving France, and by extension World War II, and by extension the Cold War, and yet he and the Germans can\u2019t even spend the two percent [of their GDP] towards NATO, and yet they\u2019re talking about an additional army. So the entire thing is absurd.\u201dHanson added, \u201cIt\u2019s what French leaders always do when their popularity is down in the 20s, which is where Macron\u2019s is.\u201dHanson examined historical lessons to be drawn from World War I\u2019s armistice and the lead-up to World War II.\u201c[Woodrow Wilson] ended up a tragic figure,\u201d assessed Hanson. \u201cHe missed one central point: When you\u2019re a wartime figure, you have to put your national interest first, and you have to ensure victory, and humiliation, and the defeat of your enemy before you talk about peace. He talked about peace first and victory second. That didn\u2019t work.\u201dHanson examined the failures of global governance structures such as the League of Nations and United Nations (U.N.) in maintaining peace between nations.Hanson stated, \u201cThe League of Nations was a complete failure. Remember, the Italians went in and just slaughtered the Ethiopians, and the British and the French had the two largest fleets in the Mediterranean, and all they had to do was stop the Italians from going through the Suez Canal. They could\u2019ve blown up every Italian ship with troops in them, and they would have never been able to get into East Africa, and yet they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dHanson went on, \u201cChina was attacked by Japan as early as 1932 and 1933, and the League of Nations could have stopped that. Japan had essentially no oil, and Holland and the Netherlands controlled the Dutch facilities next door, and we were an oil exporter, and yet we did nothing. The idea that the League of Nations failed because the United States didn\u2019t participate is kind of crazy.\u201dHanson warned against subversion of national sovereignty to international institutions such as\u00a0 the U.N. \u201cThere\u2019s not a good record of international conferences keeping the peace,\u201d noted Hanson. \u201cWhat keeps the peace is that countries that are democratic and have constitutional government are well-armed, and they deter bad actors, and say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t do what you want to do, because if you do a cost-benefit analysis you\u2019re going to pay a terrible price.\u2019 But when you lose that, you always lose that when you chop up or outsource your national security to something like the League of Nations or the U.N.\u201dHanson added, \u201cThen you get somebody who\u2019s pretty weak \u2014 Hitler in the late 30s, or Mussolini, or the Japanese government, and then later Tojo \u2014 they were pretty weak compared to the potential of the British Empire or the United States and the Western democracies in Europe, but they didn\u2019t feel they were weak because they looked at appeasement and isolationism and they thought, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s going to be easy to pick off this low-hanging fruit.\u2019 And it was until 1942.\u201dHanson cautioned against irresponsible benevolence via statecraft in wartime.\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to go in and defeat an enemy, and then to take your foot off his neck, so to speak, out of this false sense of magnanimity and humanitarianism, because once you do that, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed,\u201d noted Hanson.Hanson advised, \u201cSo if you want to go to war, you have to defeat the enemy, and you have to occupy his territory. You have to change his government, or at least change his mindset. We haven\u2019t learned that lesson. We\u2019re still dealing with the aftermath of the Korean War which also had an armistice and was not a surrender.\u201dHanson also examined left-wing news media hostility towards President Donald Trump.Hanson said, \u201cNow, with this 7-billion-person mob, and they don\u2019t know much about the past, they feel that they can just instantly serve as sort of a French revolutionary guillotine mob in the streets of Paris, and so it\u2019s instant thumbs up or down, and I think that\u2019s lost all perspective about Trump.\u201dHanson added, \u201c[Donald Trump] didn\u2019t say, \u2018Get in the their faces,\u2019 or \u2018Bring a gun to a knife fight,\u2019 or \u2018Punish our enemies,\u2019 or at least Melania didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019ve never been proud of this country,\u2019 or \u2018the United States is a downright mean country.'\u201dHanson concluded, \u201cThe idea that everything was normal until Trump came along is just a historical fallacy. For the media, there\u2019s something about [Donald Trump\u2019s] class, his accent, his appearance, his speech, and his background that they find antithetical to their whole notion of what a president should be, and they react accordingly.\u201dHanson is a professor\u00a0of Greek and director of the classics program at California State University in Fresno, CA. His forthcoming book, The Case for Trump, will be published on March 5, 2019.Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on\u00a0Twitter.\nNational SecurityPoliticsRadioAlex MarlowBreitbart News DailyDonald TrumpEmmanuel MacronEuropean Unioneuropean union armyFranceLeague of NationsNatoU.N.United NationsVictor Davis HansonwarWorld War IWorld War IIWWIWWII .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
