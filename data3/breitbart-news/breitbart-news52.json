In the past, it has done things like abolished slavery and given women if the right to vote. It\u2019s an extremely big deal to even put this out in the ether.\u201dShe continued, \u201cThis is a stereotype that people on the left want open borders and don\u2019t care about national security and people on the right are heartless and don\u2019t want anyone to come here at all. Most American meet somewhere in the middle when we talk about Dreamers and things like that. I just had so wished we would be so further along than this, because using this as a siren song as you eloquently put, Abby, to make voters care about the midterm election. This fear-mongering, It\u2019s very effective. It\u2019s irrational, but it\u2019s very effective.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nImmigrationVideobirthright citizenshipDonald TrumpMeghan McCain .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
