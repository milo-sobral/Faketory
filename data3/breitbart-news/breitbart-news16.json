{"id": "Trump: Democrats Obstruct Easy Fixes for Border Crisis, Caravan", "paragraph": "If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together, we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless  pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck & Nancy, call me!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2018Trump\u2019s tweet came as the Mexican government halted a Honduran caravan of roughly\u00a03,000 job-seeking migrants at its southern border.On Friday, the caravan broke through barriers at the Guatemalan side of the border and rushed onto a bridge\u00a0linking the two countries. Mexican police used tear gas to stop the migrant column, which then stayed on the bridge during the night.Mexican officials say they will allow 100 migrants through the barrier to seek asylum in Mexico. Once in Mexico, officials expect most of the migrants to travel north to the U.S. border alongside thousands of other migrants\u00a0who are being covertly trafficked into the U.S. by cartel-connected human smugglers.\u00a0Mexican authorities met the migrant caravan with tear gas https://t.co/uRR6Z0rwfN via @karlazabs who was at the Doctor Rodolfo Robles International Bridge in Mexico.\u2014 Adolfo Flores (@aflores) October 19, 2018Buzzfeed reported:Firing rounds of tear gas, authorities clashed with several members of the caravan, sending people on the bridge into a panicked retreat. In the mayhem, children were separated from their mothers and many fainted from heat and exhaustion. Some people jumped into the river while women and children \u2014 who had been instructed to stand at the front of the line \u2014 began trudging back the way they\u2019d came.At least 20 people were treated for injuries after clashes with authorities, including a Mexican reporter, according to the Guatemalan Red Cross.\u2026But after Mexican authorities pushed them back, clusters of defeated families sat on the bridge, trying to figure out what to do next.U.S.\u00a0media coverage of the caravan has dropped abruptly since Trump began spotlighting the group during his 2018 campaign speeches.Most of the caravan migrants are poor, male job-seekers, but the caravan\u2019s organizers \u2014 and media outlets \u2014 are showcasing the group\u2019s contingent\u00a0of women carrying children. Some of the men in the caravan also bring children because the children help trigger catch-and-release loopholes.The loopholes in U.S.\u00a0immigration law allow the migrants to live in the United States and to legally get jobs until backlogged U.S. courts reject their asylum applications. The wait for immigration court hearings can take up to two or more years. In 2017, for example, officials were forced to provide work-permit to more than 400,000 migrants, each of whom helps drag down wages for Americans\u00a0and also to boost routine consumer prices for food and other sales for U.S. retailers.This migrants\u2019 focus on economic migration \u2014 not sanctuary from criminals \u2014 is backed up by an Oct. 18\u00a0New York\u00a0Times\u00a0article which\u00a0highlighted\u00a0the migrants\u2019 focus\u00a0on jobs in the United States:For or all of them, heading north is a gamble for a better life. Most migrants said they were aware that jobs were plentiful in the United States, and many said they believed that having a child accompany them might help them avoid long-term detention \u2026Among those arriving at the motel in Tucson, there appeared to be more fathers than mothers traveling with a child. Asked why they had come north, one man after another said \u201ctrabajo\u201d \u2014 work \u2014 in construction, restaurants, landscaping or cleaning.\u201cI want to work \u2014 any job, I\u2019ll do,\u201d said one man, Efrain, as he cradled his sleepy 2-year-old daughter Suleymi and wiped her runny nose. Efrain said he had been a farmer in Guatemala and had sold a small plot of land to pay for the two-week trek to America. He said he and Suleymi were headed for Florida, where his uncle livesRead more here.\u00a0\u00a0\nBorder / Cartel ChroniclesImmigrationPoliticsDonald TrumpHuman Smugglingimmigrationmexican cartelsMigrant Caravanmigration .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
