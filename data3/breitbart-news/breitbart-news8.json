Planned Parenthood of Indiana. In the request, the state asks the Supreme Court to consider two questions:The request for a Supreme Court hearing arose out of a lawsuit\u00a0by Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK) and the ACLU over the law.\u00a0Planned Parenthood claimed the new law placed undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion and that it violated women\u2019s privacy since the group does not ask women the reason for seeking an abortion.Regarding the mandate to bury or cremate the aborted baby, Planned Parenthood said such a requirement introduces further costs for medical waste.As Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill\u2019s office explained\u00a0in a press release, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the state ban on discrimination abortions based on sex, race, or disability \u2013 asserting the law placed an undue burden upon women seeking abortion \u2013 and said that the provision regarding the remains of aborted babies served no governmental purpose.\u201cNothing in the Constitution prohibits states from requiring health facilities to provide an element of basic human dignity in disposing of fetuses,\u201d Hill said in a statement. \u201cThese tiny bodies, after all, are in fact human remains.\u201d\u201cFurther, states have every reason and right to prohibit abortions from being performed simply as a means of selecting the race, sex, or physical condition of a child,\u201d the attorney general added. \u201cThe right to abortion declared by our Supreme Court protects only the decision not to bear a child at all, not a right to decide which child to bear. Our nation knows only too well the bitter fruits of such discrimination\u201d:BREAKING: The state of Indiana has appealed @mike_pence's abortion law to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/4vIQhAc98r\u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPIndKentucky) October 15, 2018PPINK President Christie Gillespie said\u00a0in a statement that Indiana \u201ccontinues to defend those unconstitutional and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions.\u201d\u201cBy appealing to the Supreme Court, the state of Indiana is trying to not only chip away at Hoosiers\u2019 rights, but also threaten the rights of people seeking safe and legal abortion care across the country,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf they truly want to reduce the need for abortion in Indiana, our legislators should focus on expanding access to affordable birth control and comprehensive sex education, not blocking patients\u2019 access to care.\u201dThe Supreme Court will now need to consider granting certiorari, which requires four justices to agree to take up the Indiana case.\nPoliticsAbortionBrett Kavanaughgenetic abnormalitiesHouse Enrolled Act 1337Planned ParenthoodSCOTUSSex-Selective AbortionU.S. Supreme Court .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
