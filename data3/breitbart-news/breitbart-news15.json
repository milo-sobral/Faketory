{"id": "Watch \u2013 Aaron Klein: Iran Fingerprints on Gaza Terror Escalation", "paragraph": "Klein made the comments (video above) during a panel discussion on Israel\u2019s i24NEWS.Speaking on the news network\u2019s Spin Room program, hosted by Ami Kaufman, Klein stated:I think Hamas is very nervous right now about the economic situation in the Gaza Strip. You\u2019ve got Qatar pouring in fuel bypassing Hamas, bypassing the Palestinian Authority. And Hamas has to turn the anger of the Palestinian population again somebody and so they are trying to turn it against Israel.And by the way I am also wondering if Iran is sort of hijacking what is going on in the Gaza Strip as well because they are very nervous right now in Syria. And it looks like they might be telling Hamas to light things up in Gaza.Klein was speaking following a week of escalated attacks against Israel emanating from the Gaza Strip, including ramped up violent border riots, an increase in the number of incendiary devices being launched into Israel, the planting of an explosive device at the Israeli border fence, and the firing of two rockets toward central Israel. One rocket landed on an Israeli home in Beersheba, a city of 200,000, while a second rocket reportedly hit near the Tel Aviv area but fell into the sea.Klein criticized the Israeli government for its willingness to continue negotiating a truce with Hamas while Israeli cities come under fire.\u201cThe tit for tat has to stop here, though,\u201d he said, referring to the Israeli military\u2019s limited response. \u201cIsrael is feeding into this by even continuing to negotiate while on the other hand Hamas is leading a war against it.\u201dHe called for the Israel Defense Forces to \u201creestablish deterrence\u201d and \u201csmash Hamas.\u201d\nIsrael / Middle EastVideoAaron KleinGaza StripHamasIsrael Defense ForcesIsrael-Gaza Strip border .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
