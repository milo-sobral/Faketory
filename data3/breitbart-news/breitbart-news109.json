{"id": "Michael Avenatti Law Firm Evicted from CA Office for Skipping $213,000 in Rent", "paragraph": "Judge Robert J. Moss affirmed his October 22 order in Orange County Superior Court that Avenatti and his staff leave their ocean-view suite in a Newport Beach office building by Monday, despite a last-ditch effort by the attorney to block the eviction ruling, the Los Angeles Times reported.The firm\u2019s landlord, the Irvine Co., sued Avenatti\u2019s law firm, Eagan Avenatti, for eviction for dodging $213,254 in rent payments over four months.The landlord won the case against Avenatti in a one-hour trial, which Avenatti did not attend. The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office then posted an eviction notice on the law firm\u2019s offices, ordering Eagan Avenatti to vacate the building by 6:00 a.m. on November 1.Avenatti was able to delay the eviction until the Friday hearing, arguing on behalf of his other firm, Avenatti & Associates, that he entered an \u201coral rental agreement with\u201d his landlord.The landlord promptly denied this claim.The eviction order is the latest setback for the lawyer, who was\u00a0arrested for an alleged domestic violence dispute in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He was booked on a felony count of domestic violence and released on $50,000 bond.Avenatti, who is most known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, targeted President Trump and his associates for months.The left-wing attorney also flirted with a 2020 presidential run during the past few months, but his presidential prospects have taken a nosedive since his arrest on suspected domestic violence charges.The Vermont Democratic Party announced Wednesday that it would cancel all events featuring Avenatti, and a recent poll showed that zero percent of Democrats favored the porn star lawyer as a presidential candidate.\nLocalPoliticsPre-ViralCaliforniaEagan AvenattievictionMichael Avenatti .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
