Owens did post a statement on Monday, saying the \u201cpress is trying to conflate \u201cKanye West\u201d with \u201cBLEXIT\u201d and that West \u201chelped me design the \u201cX\u201d for BLEXIT.\u201cToday the press is trying to conflate \u201cKanye West \u201d with \u201cBLEXIT\u201d to get website clicks \u2014 so allow me to clarify my earlier statement,\u201d Owens wrote.\u201cI said on stage that my friend and fellow superhero helped me design the \u201cX\u201d for BLEXIT. This may shock the world, but Ye is a world renowned designed. Everyone who knows him asks him for advice on design. Ye support various people in different regards, because at the end of the day \u2014 his message about unity and love (sic),\u201d she wrote.\u201cHe supports Colin Kaepernick. He supports Amare Enyia. He has said he loves Hillary Clinton. He has said he loves Donald Trump,\u201d Owens wrote. \u201cBLEXIT is a project that is mine entirely. I am blessed that Ye introduced me to a designer who despite having totally different political beliefs than me, helped me craft some beautiful letter that I used on the BLEXIT caps.\u201d#BLEXIT is about the beautiful stories of so many black people who have awakened themselves to the possibilities of our future, as Americans.The press is trying to use Kanye\u2019s name to create drama and further divisiveness which is WRONG.
