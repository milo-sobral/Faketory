{"id": "Turkey: Woman Arrested for Interrupting Ataturk Event Shouting \u2018Allah Has Laws\u2019", "paragraph": "Insulting Atat\u00fcrk is a crime in Turkey, for which a growing number of citizens have been arrested during the tenure of Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Emine \u015eahin, 21, was arrested in the northwestern province of\u00a0Edirne after passing by a ceremony\u00a0commemorating the 80th anniversary as his death and shouting:\u00a0\u201cAtat\u00fcrk\u00a0is not divine, Allah has laws.\u00a0Atat\u00fcrk\u00a0brought the West\u2019s laws.\u201dSpeaking to authorities after her arrest,\u00a0\u015eahin said that the ceremony was \u201cagainst religion\u201d and her actions were premeditated. After spending a night in a local jail, she was sent to prison.According to a statement from\u00a0the\u00a0Edirne\u00a0Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\u00a0\u015eahin\u00a0started to shout \u201cWhy are you waiting here, what is happening here?\u201d as attendees held a minute\u2019s silence in memory of Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s life.\u201cAs she was being removed from the area by police forces, she uttered the remarks \u2018This is an insurgence, you do not know the laws of Allah, he [Atat\u00fcrk] brought the beliefs of the West,\u2019 for which an investigation was launched into on charges of insulting the memory of\u00a0Atat\u00fcrk,\u201d the statement read.\u015eahin\u2019s actions are a violation of\u00a0Turkish Law 5816\u00a0(\u201cThe Law Concerning Crimes Committed Against\u00a0Atat\u00fcrk\u201d), which seeks to \u201cprotect Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s memory,\u201d which outlaws all criticism against him.\u00a0Those found guilty can face sentences as long as three years in jail.Atat\u00fcrk\u00a0founded\u00a0the Republic of Turkey in 1923 following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. His leadership was based in his philosophy of secularism by separating Islam from politics\u00a0and constructing a legal system independent of religious law.Police action against crime related to Atat\u00fcrk has increased under Erdogan, a defender of the Muslim Brotherhood who has publicly condemned some of the founder\u2019s policies as he champions a range of religious reforms intended to desecularize the country\u2019s education system and base it in Islamic theology. Erdogan has not suffered any legal action for rejecting Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s political philosophy\u00a0but has often availed himself of a similar law against \u201cinsulting the president\u201d to silence critics.Among the most\u00a0recent crimes against Atat\u00fcrk, last month, Turkish authorities detained a man who uploaded a video of himself insulting and hitting a statue of Atat\u00fcrk\u00a0in the capital of Istanbul. In September, Turkish prosecutors also\u00a0ordered\u00a0the detention of a school teacher who described Atat\u00fcrk on social media as the\u00a0\u201cthe biggest devil of the 20th century.\u201dFollow Ben Kew on\u00a0Facebook, Twitter at\u00a0@ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\nAsiaNational SecurityKemal AtaturkReccip ErdoganTurkey .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
