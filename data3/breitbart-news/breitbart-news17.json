And anybody who praises that is doing something appalling.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI sometimes wonder if we should ignore it. Because it sets off a cultural drama where one group of people gets upset, and then the other group of people are delighted the other group of people got upset, and it just creates this drama that benefits Trump, frankly.\u201dBrooks added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try to maintain some sense of standards of how public officials are supposed to act with integrity. But, sometimes, I feel manipulated when I do react, because that\u2019s sort of what Donald Trump wants.\u201dHe later considered whether Democrats could sway more swing voters by focusing on \u201cwhat Trump is doing to the culture\u201d due to the fact that \u201cthere are a lot of pretty conservative people who think what\u2019s happening to the country is pretty awful.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nVideoBen JacobsDavid BrooksDonald TrumpGreg Gianforte .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
