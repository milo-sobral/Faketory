{"id": "Ann Coulter: Crazed Zealot Jeff Sessions Attempts to Enforce Law!", "paragraph": "The Times\u2019 sources were \u201ccurrent and former career department lawyers.\u201d In other words, Trump-hating Democratic zealots weeks away from their book contracts.\u00a0One attorney who left the Department of Justice during its descent into madness under Sessions was Stephen J. Buckingham. (Why not \u201cAstor\u201d or \u201cCarnegie\u201d?)\u00a0As at any federal agency, 99 percent of \u201ccareer\u201d attorneys at DOJ are left-wing. Social activists move effortlessly from the ACLU, the Democratic Socialists of America and the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Rights Task Force to government jobs. Thus, one entry on Buckingham\u2019s resume is that he \u201ccreated a program to amend the immigration status of unaccompanied Sudanese refugee minors.\u201d\u00a0During Democratic administrations, these selfless career employees sell guns to Mexican drug cartels and run around the country making sure local police forces can\u2019t do their jobs. During Republican administrations, they spend their time quietly, relentlessly sabotaging the administration they allegedly serve.\u00a0In addition to being a nonstop source of critical remarks about the Trump administration, \u201ccareer\u201d DOJ employees also lead mob assaults on Cabinet members, as Allison Hrabar did to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in June.\u00a0Along with a dozen of her friends from the Democratic Socialists of America, DOJ paralegal Hrabar surrounded Nielsen\u2019s table at a Washington, D.C., restaurant, shouting: \u201cKirstjen Nielsen, you\u2019re a villain!\u201d \u201cIf kids don\u2019t eat in peace, you don\u2019t eat in peace!\u201d \u201cThe f\u2014ing gall!\u201d \u201cShame on you!\u201d \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d \u201cFascist pig!\u201d \u2014 which Nielsen eventually realized was not the evening\u2019s special.(And it still didn\u2019t occur to Gen. John Kelly\u2019s special friend Nielsen why voters wanted a wall.)\u00a0It took months of complaints about the DOJ not firing Hrabar \u2014 and her own arrogant claim that she\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0be fired \u2014 for her to finally lose her job.\u00a0In Buckingham\u2019s case, he told the Times that his conscience was shocked when Sessions asked him a legal question. (God forbid the attorney general question one of the lawyers working at DOJ!)\u00a0The Times reports: \u201cIn one instance, Mr. Sessions directly questioned a career lawyer, Stephen Buckingham, who was asked to find ways to file a lawsuit to crack down on sanctuary laws protecting undocumented immigrants. Mr. Buckingham, who had worked at the Justice Department for about a decade, wrote in a brief\u201d \u2014 and presumably his forthcoming memoirs \u2014 \u201cthat he could find no legal grounds for such a case.\u201d\u00a0Anyone else remember Arizona being denounced for two years during the Obama administration for trying to enforce immigration laws that the federal government wouldn\u2019t?\u00a0Hey, idiots! The feds have total control over immigration.\u00a0Didn\u2019t Khizr Khan give Buckingham a copy of his Constitution?\u00a0I have been\u00a0not\u00a0practicing law longer than \u201cBuckingham\u201d was at the Justice Department, but I found possible legal grounds to go after sanctuary cities in approximately eight seconds on Google.\u00a0Title 18 of the U.S. Code is the federal criminal code. Section 3 states: \u201cAccessory after the fact. Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s hard to miss Section 3. Section 1 was repealed in 1984, and Section 2 consists of only 52 words. But Buckingham must have exhausted himself reading Section 2 and didn\u2019t have the energy to shove ahead to Section 3.\u00a0Even if a couple sentences is your maximum reading limit, the crime of \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d has gotten a lot of airtime since Trump became president. It is one of the\u00a0literally millions\u00a0of laws Trump has probably broken, demanding his impeachment.\u00a0Before Trump was even inaugurated, Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee was claiming on MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews\u2019 show that Trump could be an \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d to the (nonexistent) Russian collusion.\u00a0Earlier this year, Frank Figliuzzi, the former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, elaborated on this theory on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell,\u201d explaining that the president may have helped Vladimir Putin avoid punishment for his felonious act of taking out Facebook ads (or something).\u00a0By contrast with the (nonexistent) felony of (nonexistent) Russian collusion, the whole point of a \u201csanctuary city\u201d is to shelter known criminals from arrest and deportation.\u00a0Sanctuary cities like Philadelphia expressly prohibit officials from giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement advance notice before releasing illegal alien inmates to the public. In California, even if ICE shows up asking for a specific criminal alien, state and local government officials are instructed to refuse to comply, except in cases of certain violent felonies.\u00a0Prosecutors in \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions throughout the country are dropping criminal charges against immigrants \u2014 or allowing them to plea to minor offenses \u2014 for the sole purpose of preventing their deportation.\u00a0In practice, this means less punishment for noncitizens than U.S. citizens. Talk about the \u201cnew Jim Crow.\u201d\u00a0Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf not only refused to cooperate with federal law enforcement, she\u00a0actually warned\u00a0illegal aliens of an impending ICE raid.\u00a0These government officials are threatening the lives and safety of their own constituents by actively assisting known criminals escape apprehension by federal law enforcement. As Democrat Sheila Kuehl, chair of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors, put it, Californians should \u201clie, cheat and steal\u201d to ensure that no immigrant be deported.\u00a0It\u2019s hard to think of a more fundamental betrayal of the public trust.\u00a0Yes, you\u2019re right, New York Times. Poor career attorneys are being asked to do horrible things under Jeff Sessions. Such as enforce the law.\u00a0\nPoliticsACLUAllison HrabarDemocratic Socialists of AmericaDonald TrumpJeff SessionsKirstjen NielsenThe New York Times .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
