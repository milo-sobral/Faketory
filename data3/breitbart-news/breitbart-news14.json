{"id": "Brooks: Trump \u2018Embodying\u2019 the \u2018Ethos\u2019 that U.S. Only Cares About Money", "paragraph": "On Friday\u2019s \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d\u00a0New York Times\u00a0columnist David Brooks predicted that the US will probably react to the death of\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0writer Jamal\u00a0Khashoggi by pretending to be angry, and then going back to normal. He further stated that the idea that the US is only about money \u201cis pretty much the ethos that Trump is embodying in a quite unembarrassed way.\u201dBrooks said, \u201cIn the Middle East, people understand you go through periods where people have to pretend to be mad at you, and then they go back to normal affairs. And I suspect that\u2019s what the Trump administration is going to do with Saudi Arabia.\u201dHe later added, \u201cI guess this is why I\u2019m a little mystified that the Democrats are not going after this issue more, why they\u2019re going after health care and other policy issues. To me, this is the big issue of the election, that if \u2014 frankly, if Donald \u2014 if the Republicans keep the House and the Senate, then Donald Trump will feel unleashed. \u2026 And so, to me, that\u2019s the core issue. How do we see ourselves as a country? What kind of country do we say? Are we strictly a money country? We sometimes look like that to outsiders. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. But that is pretty much the ethos that Trump is embodying in a quite unembarrassed way.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nIsrael / Middle EastVideoDavid BrooksDonald TrumpJamal KhashoggiSaudi Arabia .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
