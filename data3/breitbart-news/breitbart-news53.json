{"id": "Sheriff\u2019s Office Places \u2018No Trick-Or-Treat\u2019 Signs on Sex Offender Homes", "paragraph": "The Butts County Sheriff\u2019s Office posted a message on Facebook Saturday notifying residents that it would be placing signs with the phrase \u201cWARNING! NO TRICK-OR-TREAT AT THIS ADDRESS!!\u201d on the front doors of every residence belonging to a registered sex offender.\u201cGeorgia law forbids registered sex offenders from participating in Halloween, to include decorations on their property,\u201d Sheriff Gary Long said in the Facebook post. \u201cWith the Halloween on the square not taking place this year, I fully expect the neighborhoods to be very active with children trick-or-treating.\u201dThe department said the goal of the campaign is to ensure families can be well informed if there is a sex offender in the neighborhood where children are trick-or-treating.\u201cThere are some sex offenders that are not happy,\u201d Long told\u00a0WCNC. \u201cBut I\u2019m not in the business of making them happy. I\u2019m in the business of keeping safe communities and making sure that our children are protected.\u201dPolice departments across the country are going the extra mile to ensure children are safe on Halloween. Several police departments over the past few weeks used social media to urge parents to call 911 if they notice their children bringing home suspicious looking candies in their trick-or-treat bags.\nCrimePre-ViralTechGeorgiaHalloweenSex Offender .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
