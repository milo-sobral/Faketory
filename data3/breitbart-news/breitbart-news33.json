{"id": "Turkey Reportedly Refuses to Give Khashoggi Audio to CIA Chief", "paragraph": "Reuters on Tuesday quoted Western security officials who said that despite extensive Turkish media coverage of the rumored audio, \u201cneither U.S. nor allied government agencies have been granted access as of late Monday to such evidence.\u201d The officials added that U.S. and allied intelligence agencies \u201cpossess little hard evidence\u201d related to the case. Pro-government Turkish media, on the other hand, claimed on Wednesday that \u201call the evidence\u201d related to Khashoggi\u2019s murder has been shared with the CIA.\u201cVideo images and audio tapes, as well as evidence gathered from the consulate and the consul\u2019s residence, were shared with Haspel during the briefing at the Turkish intelligence organization,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Sabah said, as related by Middle East Eye.Withholding evidence would be especially vexing given that the degree of involvement by the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is a paramount concern for U.S. diplomacy.Nearly all global media coverage of the case has been driven by rumors and leaks to Turkish media by anonymous officials. The most recent rumor claims someone from Riyadh, possibly top bin Salman aide Saud al-Qahtani, supervised the abuse and murder of Khashoggi through a telephone or network connection like Skype. Such evidence would go a long way toward pinpointing the level of complicity in Khashoggi\u2019s killing by high-level officials or the monarchy.Another story government sources leaked to Turkish media on Wednesday claimed the Saudis have reneged on their promise to fully cooperate with investigators by denying permission for Turkish police to search a well in the garden of the Istanbul consulate.NPR on Monday noted Haspel made a good choice of emissary to Turkey for Khashoggi affair, as she speaks Turkish and has described Istanbul as one of her favorite cities. Tom Rogan at the Washington Examiner notes she has been stationed in Turkey at least twice and \u201chas a respectful relationship with Turkey\u2019s capable primary intelligence service, the MiT.\u201d (In Rogan\u2019s estimation, \u201ccapable\u201d means quite capable of bugging the Saudi consulate).Rogan suggests Turkey\u2019s truculence might be due in part to tensions with the Trump administration over Turkey\u2019s cooperation with Russian intelligence, its indulgence of anti-American nationalist groups, and U.S. support for Kurdish groups in Syria and Iraq which Turkey views as partners of the violent separatist PKK organization. Relations between Turkey and the U.S. were in the first tentative stages of improving after the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson when the Khashoggi crisis erupted.The Washington Post, which employed Khashoggi as a contributor, on Wednesday explored how Erdogan has used a combination of tight control over the evidence and leaks distributed by Turkish media to take control of the case. Erdogan\u2019s taste for the style of Islamist government espoused by Khashoggi, his relationship with Saudi Arabia\u2019s adversary Qatar, and his penchant for controlling information \u2013 including the wholesale abuse of journalists \u2013 are among the reasons to be suspicious of his motives. One way or the other, no matter how solid Turkey\u2019s evidence turns out to be or what it reveals about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s involvement, there is no question Erdogan will lose a substantial amount of control over the situation once significant evidence is shared with other countries.As NPR\u2019s analysis noted, the more cynical observers of Erdogan\u2019s conduct in the Khashoggi affair see more maneuvering, signaling, and negotiation than dogged searching for the truth. Erdogan says he wants the \u201cnaked truth,\u201d but the truth hasn\u2019t even taken off her coat and slipped into something more comfortable yet.\nIsrael / Middle EastNational SecurityCIA Director Gina HaspelJamal KhashoggiPresident Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fanSaudi ArabiaTurkey .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
