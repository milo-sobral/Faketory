{"id": "Exclusive\u2013Kris Kobach: Migrant Caravan is \u2018Most Advanced Stage\u2019 of Left\u2019s \u2018Open Borders Psychosis\u2019", "paragraph": "Kobach, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, said the migrant caravan of Central Americans \u2014 which consist of previously deported illegal aliens and job-seekers \u2014 is the final stage in the open borders agenda, dating back to the 1990s.\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 reaction to the caravan \u2026 they\u2019re reacting by calling it a \u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019 and cheering\u00a0on the migrants,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cThis is the most advanced stage of their open borders psychosis.\u201dKobach detailed that in 1996, Democrats, with President Bill Clinton at the helm, had supported pro-immigration enforcement.\u201cIt was a pro-enforcement bill that Clinton signed and many Democrats agreed with,\u201d Kobach said.Later in the 2000s, though, Democrats changed their position on immigration enforcement and instead took a hardline pro-amnesty stance that focused on allowing the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. to permanently stay in the country.\u201cMaybe they could stomach some enforcement of immigration, but they were cheering the illegal aliens already here,\u201d Kobach said.Today, Kobach says the Democrat Party\u2019s national platform is pro-illegal immigration, not only in the U.S., but now for foreign nationals seeking to arrive in the U.S. through the southern border making false asylum claims.\u201cNow we have a new phase of the open borders psychosis which is the left cheering illegal aliens outside of the country to come in,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cWhich is a huge process past advocating for amnesty for illegal aliens already in the country.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re demanding the border be open,\u201d Kobach continued.Kobach also noted that despite the establishment media\u2019s claims of the caravan migrants fleeing a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in Central America, there is \u201cno war and no famine\u201d in the region.In a column for Breitbart News, Kobach called the migrant caravan a \u201cconsequence of rewarding illegal immigration,\u201d writing that the \u201ccaravan also illustrates the rampant abuse of our asylum laws.\u201dI will be on Sean Hannity's radio show at 1:10 p.m. talking about my latest Breitbart column about the caravan and how we need governors who will work with President Trump to stop illegal immigration. #ksleg #ksgov You can read the column here. https://t.co/hQh9wSxxHq\u2014 Kris W. Kobach (@KrisKobach1787) October 24, 2018President Trump this week\u00a0announced\u00a0that he would begin the process of cutting off foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador for their inability to stop the migrant caravan from marching up to the U.S.-Mexico border. The president also\u00a0called\u00a0the caravan a \u201cnational emergency.\u201dThe Central American countries receive\u00a0more than $500 million in federal aid from the U.S. every year. Trump has not yet indicated how much of that federal aid will be cut.Breitbart Texas\u00a0reported that the migrant caravan stormed through Mexico last week, tearing down a border barrier in the process as they crossed from Guatemala\u00a0to Mexico. A second group of about 250 migrants from El Salvador are expected to follow the current caravan and head to the U.S.-Mexico border next week.Less than six months ago,\u00a0a similar migrant caravan\u00a0was allowed to cross into the U.S. with weak asylum claims despite threats from President Trump to close down the border. Many migrants from that caravan are now illegal aliens living in the U.S. as they await their asylum hearings.John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.
