{"id": "Southern California Edison Reported Circuit Malfunction Minutes Before Woolsey Fire Began", "paragraph": "California Public Utilities Commission received\u00a0a report via SCE on Thursday, which it says was filed \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d detailing the incident. The utility giant told the agency a circuit located at its Chatsworth substation \u201crelayed\u201d at 2:22 p.m. The\u00a0system failure occurred transpired on East Street and Alfa Road, close to where the Woosley Fire started, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAt this point, we have no indication from fire agency personnel that SCE utility facilities may have been involved in the start of the fire,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe investigation into the matter is ongoing.\u201dThe company has yet to gain access to the substation where the blaze started.\u201cDuring anticipated Red Flag conditions,\u00a0when circuits in the affected area detect a disturbance (relay) and become de-energized, the circuit will not automatically be re-energized,\u201d the company said \u201cThis means an outage remains until it is safe to manually re-energize the circuit. This is not a Public Safety Power Shutoff; it is simply a safety feature to help mitigate wildfire risk.\u201d\nIn a statement released Monday, a CPUC spokesperson said they are continuing to monitor the fire and will \u201cincorporate Edison\u2019s incident report\u00a0into its investigation\u201d as to how the Woosley fire began.At least 9,000 Southern California Edison remain without power due to the damage its systems sustained amid the raging fire. The company notified customers in La Verne and Malibu that they would lose power Monday as firefighters struggle to contain the fire, says the utility company\u2019s press representative\u00a0Lois Pitter Bruce.\u201cCrews are trying to gain access, but due to treacherous conditions, our restoration is not going to be as expedited as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d\u00a0Bruce told reporters.The Woolsey fire grew to more than 143 square miles with 20 percent containment as of Monday morning, according to the Associated\u00a0Press. Authorities\u00a0confirmed over the weekend the blaze\u2019s death toll stands at two people. In Northern California, at 30 people are dead as the Camp Wire continues to rage. Relatives are conducting a manhunt to locate nearly 230 missing people. The fire, which destroyed most of the 27,000-strong city of Paradise, is now the most deadly fire in the state\u2019s modern history.\nEnvironmentLocalCaliforniafirefirefightersMalibuParadiseSouthern California EdisonWildfires .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
