On Wednesday evening, CNN President Jeff Zucker\u00a0issued a statement Wednesday\u00a0blasting the White House for its \u201ctotal and complete lack of understanding\u201d of the \u201cseriousness of their\u00a0continued attacks on the media.\u201dCarrey, meanwhile, is known for his extreme opposition to conservatism and the Trump presidency. Earlier this month, he\u00a0explained that his often controversial artwork represents his personal way of dealing with the \u201cpain\u201d inflicted by the Trump administration,\u00a0who he\u00a0claims\u00a0is \u201cpushing the country towards suffering beyond all imagination.\u201d\nEntertainmentPoliticsTechBomb ThreatsdemocratsDonald TrumpHollywoodJim Carreypolitical violenceTerrorirsm .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
