These are all targets that have been criticized mercilessly by right-wing outlets, by fringe groups on the internet and by some right-wing commentators. And already, there\u2019s this awful rush to try to claim it\u2019s a false flag operation, figures like Rush Limbaugh, who have a lot of power, who have a lot of influence, who have a lot of fans, are out there saying awful things. Mail bombs were sent to the offices of CNN in New York City, as well as to the homes of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and liberal billionaire George Soros Wednesday. Luckily, all the bombs were caught early and nobody was hurt.President Trump strongly condemned the attempted attacks, saying, \u201cWe have to unify, we have to come together, and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts and threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\u201dHowever, this apparently wasn\u2019t enough for CNN President Jeff Zucker, who issued a statement slamming the White House for a \u201ctotal and complete lack of understanding\u201d of \u201cthe seriousness of their continued attacks on the media.\u201dStatement from CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker: pic.twitter.com/OXyIT6oSLT\u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) October 24, 2018\u00a0\nMediaPoliticsBrian StelterChris CuomoCNNDonald TrumpJeff ZuckerMail Bombs .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
