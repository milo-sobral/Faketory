{"id": "Pelosi, Schumer: Trump Condemnation of Mail Bombs \u2018Hollow,\u2019 Needs to \u2018Reverse\u2019 Older Statements", "paragraph": "\u201cOnce again, we salute the heroism of America\u2019s first responders as they work to counter the outrageous mail bomb attacks. We listened with great interest to the President\u2019s remarks this afternoon. We all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people, and that is our first responsibility,\u201d the Democrat Party leaders wrote before turning their attention to the president. \u201cHowever, President Trump\u2019s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence. Time and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions: expressing support for the Congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.\u201dIn joint statement, Senate and House Minority Leaders Schumer and Pelosi say President Trump's comments today on the wave of pipe bomb packages \u201cring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.\u201d https://t.co/hK4Eecmjdo pic.twitter.com/DjbunZS0AR\u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 24, 2018As reported by Breitbart News, the U.S. Secret Service intercepted crude pipe\u00a0bombs sent to the residences of former President Barack Obama and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Tuesday evening and Wednesday. Additionally, CNN\u2019s Manhattan headquarters was evacuated following the discovery of an explosive device addressed to former CIA Director and MSNBC contributor John Brennan. A similar explosive was found at the Westchester Country home of progressive billionaire George Soros on Monday, in what law enforcement officials now believe may have been sent from the same person.Before a White House event this afternoon, President Donald Trump condemned the attacks and called on Americans to come together.\u00a0\u201cActs or threats of political violence have no place in the United States,\u201d the president said. \u201cThis egregious conduct is abhorrent.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a very bipartisan statement,\u201d he added.President Trump said the\u00a0events left him and fellow Americans \u201cextremely angry, upset, unhappy\u201d and vowed to hold the\u00a0perpetrator accountable.In an earlier statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described the attacks as \u201cdespicable\u201d and called for the \u201ccowards\u201d behind the packages to be brought to justice.Statement on suspicious packages: pic.twitter.com/pYSbDvCvuk\u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) October 24, 2018\nCrimePoliticsChuck SchumerDonald TrumpNancy Pelosi .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
