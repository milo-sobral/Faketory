So, it\u2019s not one-sided. \u2026 But the Saudis need to understand that there\u2019s consequences to this type of action, that this violates just the basic norms of international law, and what they did, there is consequences to. So, I think we can do both. The strategic partnership needs to continue, and our reaction needs to be focused on accountability for this tragedy.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nIsrael / Middle EastVideoBen CardinJamal KhashoggiSaudi Arabia .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
