{"id": "Report: Unable to Reach Asia Bibi, Pakistan\u2019s Islamists Attacking Random Christians", "paragraph": "Breitbart News has long reported that Pakistan\u2019s controversial blasphemy law is disproportionally used target religious minorities, particularly Christians.Human rights groups have determined that Muslims often use the law to settle personal disputes and vendettas.Peter Jacob, the executive director for the Center for Social Justice in Lahore, told CNN that half of the individuals accused of blasphemy in Pakistan are non-Muslims, adding that his organization registered cases in which anti-Bibi rioters asked travelers to divulge their religion, and if they revealed they were Christian, \u201cThey were taken out of their cars and beaten up.\u201d\u201cThe mental and psychological scars\u201d inflicted on the Christian community will endure in the \u201ccurrent climate of fear,\u201d Jacob noted.CNN recently spoke to members of the Christian minority community in Pakistan impacted by Bibi\u2019s acquittal.\u201cWhile speculation is rife about the safety of Bibi and her family, there are larger conversations at stake regarding the protection of Pakistan\u2019s tiny Christian minority,\u201d CNN noted, adding, \u201cThe country\u2019s strict blasphemy laws are a topic of great sensitivity in Pakistan; accusations of blasphemy have seen a surge in mob violence and lynchings in pockets of the country.\u201dFollowers of Christ make up less than two percent of Pakistan\u2019s population of 200 million, according to Jacob. Yet they have been in the territory that forms modern Pakistan for centuries, long before it was declared an Islamic country.\u201cPlease don\u2019t name us,\u201d a member of Pakistan\u2019s Christian minority told CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cBut we are Christians and if Muslims aren\u2019t safe from these conversations then we are nothing to these people, we respect the judgment of the Supreme Court, and that is paramount, I just want this situation to go away and for this tension to be lifted from our shoulders.\u201dNearly a week after the October 31 Supreme Court decision to acquit Bibi, Pakistani authorities moved her to an undisclosed location last Thursday, fearing for her safety.Islamists linked to the anti-blasphemy Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party that orchestrated riots across the Muslim country soon after the supreme court\u2019s decision have threatened to kill Bibi, her lawyer, and the judges who cleared her.Last Friday, the Pakistani government reached a deal with TLP to prevent Bibi from leaving the country while the Supreme Court deals with petitions to review its acquittal of the Christian mother of five.Islamabad has also agreed not to prevent the TLP from filing a petition to add Bibi to a list preventing her from leaving Pakistan.Bibi spent nearly eight years incarcerated on death row before her acquittal.The Christian mother and her family are reportedly seeking asylum in the Netherlands. Spain, France, Italy, and most recently Canada have also reportedly\u00a0offered the Christian mother and her family asylum.\nAsiaNational SecurityAsia BibiblasphemyChristian persecutionChristiansPakistan .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
