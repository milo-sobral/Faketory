{"id": "United States, Canada Only Nations in Developed World with Unrestricted Birthright Citizenship", "paragraph": "The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as \u201canchor babies,\u201d as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are\u00a0at least 4.5 million\u00a0anchor babies in the country,\u00a0a population that exceeds\u00a0the total number of annual American births.Subsequently, when given birthright citizenship, anchor babies are also rewarded with the privilege of bringing their foreign relatives to the U.S. through the process known as \u201cchain migration.\u201d Every two new immigrants to the U.S. bring an estimated seven foreign relatives with them.Data compiled by NumbersUSA\u00a0notes that the U.S. and Canada are the only two developed nations \u2014 as defined by the International Monetary Fund \u2014 which give birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens.Meanwhile, developed nations like Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland have all repealed their birthright citizenship laws within the last 15 years. Even some of the most immigration-maximalist countries in the Western world like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France do not offer birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens.On Tuesday, President Trump announced that he is readying an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. The unilateral move would carry the U.S. into the future on the issue, putting the nation more in line with similar Western countries.The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars\u00a0dispute\u00a0the idea.Many leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration. As\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0recently reported, there are more anchor baby births in the Los Angeles, California metro area than the total of U.S. births in 14 states and the District of Colombia. Every year,\u00a0American taxpayers are billed about\u00a0$2.4 billion\u00a0to pay for the births of illegal aliensJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
