{"id": "Steve Kerr: \u2018I Support Colin Kaepernick 100 Percent\u2019", "paragraph": "In an interview with NBC Sports Bay Area, Kerr not only said he supports Kaepernick. He also said the former 49er \u201cdeserves\u201d a chance to play in the league again.\u201cI support Colin Kaepernick 100 percent, and I think he deserves a chance to play,\u201d Kerr told Monte Pool of NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cAnd I was happy see Eric Reid was picked up recently \u2014 Kap\u2019s teammate who also knelt last year. So I support their right to play.\u201dKerr\u2019s comments about Kaepernick came after he said he sometimes feels \u201cpatronized\u201d by \u201cnationalistic military displays,\u201d at sporting events:\u2018It wouldn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m not for it, nor against it,\u2019 Kerr explained. \u2018I believe patriotism is about doing something good for others, for other Americans. That\u2019s the best way to be patriotic, to get out and volunteer and help others. That\u2019s what drives me crazy about the uproar over the NFL players who have knelt in a fight for social justice. So many of them have given so much to their communities \u2014 given not just money but time. I read a lot about Malcolm Jenkins in Philadelphia and what he\u2019s done in his community. And Chris Long. And people like Colin Kaepernick who have given a million dollars to charity.\u2018I\u2019m so proud of so many athletes who are out there in their communities, knowing the power they have and the financial resources they have to make a change. That\u2019s patriotism to me. The anthem is just kind of a symbol for that.\u2019Kerr also laid out his reasoning for why he believes NFL executives haven\u2019t signed Kaepernick:\u2018I also see this entire media frenzy that surrounds it,\u2019 Kerr said. \u2018And if I\u2019m a GM of a team, I know the minute I sign Colin Kaepernick, it\u2019s like signing Tim Tebow. Or it\u2019s like signing, you know, one of the Ball brothers. And that\u2019s probably a bad analogy. But it\u2019s going to come with a storm. So even if your heart\u2019s in the right place, and you go, \u2018You know what? This is all BS,\u2019 I want my team to be able to function. And I want to bring in a backup quarterback. But I don\u2019t want a news conference every single day. I could see a GM going, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t really want to deal with that.\u2019 That\u2019s modern media. That\u2019s modern American life.\u2019The NBA has a rule mandating that their players stand for the American and Canadian national anthems. As a result, the anthem protest movement did not become an issue in the \u201cassociation.\u201d However, the league has dozens of outspoken players\u00a0\u2014 and coaches\u00a0\u2014 who regularly speak out and engage in various forms of activism.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn\nSportsColin KaepernickGolden State WarriorsNational Anthem ProtestsNBANFLSteve Kerr .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
