{"id": "Rhodes: House Dems Should Investigate What Trump Knew About Khashoggi and When", "paragraph": "On Saturday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cUp,\u201d MSNBC Contributor and former Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes stated House Democrats should investigate whether the White House knew that Saudi Crown Prince\u00a0Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0writer Jamal\u00a0Khashoggi and lied about it, and why the White House is \u201ccovering up for the Saudi murder of a dissident in a third country?\u201dRhodes said, \u201cI think what\u2019s very important here, and one of the things I want to know about is, what did Trump know and when did he know it? Because the US intelligence community\u2026Saudi Arabia is something that they follow very closely. And so, the idea that something like this would happen without our intelligence agencies knowing something about what happened, I always thought was very unlikely. And so, what we\u2019ve seen over the last few weeks is Trump kind of trying to get through this, and trying to avoid blaming Mohammed bin Salman, this person who he\u2019s held in a full embrace since the beginning of his presidency. He\u2019s acted almost like the defense attorney for Mohammed bin Salman, trying to figure out what the cover story is today.\u201dHe continued, \u201cAnd they just felt like they were about to get through it. And now we have this report that the US intelligence community has high confidence assessment that MBS did this. \u2026 That\u2019s based on information they\u2019ve been looking at for some time. So, when Trump says, well, we just got this information in, no. You just got an intelligence assessment that leaked to the press. The intelligence that informed that assessment has probably been in the system for some time. And guess what? They\u00a0would share intelligence about a high profile event like this with the White House. So, I think a Democratic House should look very carefully at, was the White House aware that MBS was responsible for this murder? Were they lying about it when they knew MBS was responsible for this murder? Why are they covering up for the Saudi murder of a dissident in a third country?\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nIsrael / Middle EastPoliticsVideoben rhodesDonald TrumpJamal KhashoggiSaudi Arabia .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
