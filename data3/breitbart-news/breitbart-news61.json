William Owens (@caapusa) November 4, 2018In August, the black faith leader replied to critics of his decision to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House.Owens condemned what he saw as the shortsighted and divisive partisanship that does nothing to help those who truly are in need in black communities.\u201cFor years, I have criticized people in power for doing little to restore our inner cities, enact prison reform, or meet the needs of black Americans,\u201d stated Owens. \u201cNow, when a president hears our concerns and demonstrates a willingness to address them, I\u2019m expected to reject any help because of political partisanship?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t just wrongheaded thinking; it\u2019s actively harmful to our people,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThe contempt and hatred some Christians have for President Trump is unchristian.\u201dThe black leader said progressives are condemning his support for Trump because the president is a Republican.He continued:The people who have hurled insults like \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 at me and the other faith leaders at the White House should look to their own motives. Those of us who met with the president were putting principle first. The name-callers, however, are so subjugated by one political party that they will turn on their own people rather than accept a difference of perspective. It\u2019s clear to me who \u2018s really being oppressed here \u2026 and it\u2019s not the group in the White House.\u201cThat is intolerance masquerading as righteousness, and I will have no part of it,\u201d Owens said. \u201cSince when is it shameful to sit down with the most powerful person in the world to discuss ways to help the least of my brothers?\u201d\u00a0\nFaithMidterm ElectionPoliticsblack faith leadersCoalition of African-American PastorsDonald Trumpincitement to violenceliberal intoleranceRev.
