They also carried signs that bore the word, \u201cEnough.\u201dNeither the Lakers, Clippers, nor Kings pointed to a specific gun control they want to see passed. Perhaps that is because California already had nearly every gun control imaginable.The state has universal background checks, firearm registration laws, red flag laws, a requirement that would-be gun buyers first get a certificate of safety from the state, a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban, a one handgun-a-month purchase limit, a \u201cgood cause\u201d qualification for concealed carry permit issuance, a ban on campus carry, a ban on carrying guns in places that serve alcohol for consumption, and controls for ammunition purchases.The Borderline Bar & Grill gunman used a legally-purchased handgun.AWR\u00a0Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host\u00a0of the Breitbart podcast\u00a0Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of\u00a0Down Range with AWR Hawkins,\u00a0a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
