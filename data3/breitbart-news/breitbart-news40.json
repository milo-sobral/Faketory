{"id": "Beto O\u2019Rourke: Trump Calling the Press the \u2018Enemy of the People\u2019 an Incitement to Violence", "paragraph": "Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) said President Donald Trump calling the press \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d was \u201cincitement to violence.\u201dO\u2019Rourke said, \u201cThis idea fronted by the president that somehow the press are the enemy of the people, reinforced by him tweeting out images of a reporter being hit by a train, body slammed in a wrestling ring, it is incitement to violence. I don\u2019t know any other way to call it. That undermines an essential pillar of the American democracy\u2014242 years into this audacious experiment, that is the exception, not the rule in world history, that we can freely choose those who represent us and guide the course and direction that this country will take.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a free press, if we cannot make informed decisions at the ballot box, if you can\u2019t hold people like me accountable and make sure that we\u2019re held honest to the promises that we made to the job that we\u2019re performing and the positions of public trust, we\u2019ll lose the very essence of our democracy. Nothing guarantees us a 243rd or 244th year unless all of us stand up for the institutions that make us so strong in the first place. So I think we need to vigorously defend the freedom of the press. We need to call out violations, not just in this country, in countries like Mexico, one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist, the killing of Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government, there has to be consequences. There has to be accountability. There has to be justice. This is our chance to lead on one of the most important issues to our democracy and to freedom around the world.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nMidterm ElectionVideoBeto O'RourkeDonald Trump .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
