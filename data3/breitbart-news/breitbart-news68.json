{"id": "Ann Coulter: 14th Amendment Now Used to Drive Down Black Americans\u2019 Wages", "paragraph": "During an interview with talk radio host\u00a0Lars Larson, Coulter said the 14th Amendment was intended for black Americans but is now being used by the big business lobby to drive down black Americans\u2019 wages by incentivizing illegal immigration.Coulter said:The 14th Amendment \u2026 was about freed slaves. They were part of the Civil Rights, rather Civil War amendments as they\u2019re called. It was all about freed slaves and now we\u2019re living in this upside down sicko \u2018Alice and Wonderland\u2019 like a Frankenstein world where the 14th Amendment which was passed to recognize the rights of free blacks in America is being used to drive down African-American wages in America, to ruin their neighborhoods, to fill up their hospitals so the Koch brothers can have cheap labor. Every president should have issued this executive order. [Emphasis added]Last week, President\u00a0Trump announced\u00a0that he is readying an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. The unilateral move would carry the U.S. into the future on the issue, putting the nation more in line with similar Western countries.\u00a0There are at least\u00a04.5 million anchor babies\u00a0in the U.S. with nearly\u00a0300,000 anchor babies\u00a0born every year.Coulter says Trump \u201cshould have done [the executive order] his second day in office.\u201dBirthright citizenship rewards the children of illegal aliens, commonly known as \u201canchor babies,\u201d with automatic U.S. citizenship, thus anchoring their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. Eventually, those anchor babies are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as \u201cchain migration,\u201d making birthright citizenship not only a driver of more illegal immigration, but also legal immigration.As Breitbart News has chronicled, black Americans are one of the most adversely impacted demographic groups by mass immigration to the U.S. Researcher Steven Camarota has noted in multiple studies that black Americans are vastly more likely to be forced to compete against low-wage immigrants for jobs than white Americans.The Supreme Court has never explicitly\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars\u00a0dispute\u00a0the idea.Many\u00a0leading conservative scholars\u00a0argue the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th Amendment was ratified.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
