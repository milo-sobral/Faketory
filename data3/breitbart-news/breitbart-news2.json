{"id": "EPA Reverses Obama Era Last Minute Uranium Mining Regulations", "paragraph": "The regulations were put in place on Jan. 19, 2017, just hours before Barack Obama left office and President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201cIn a rush to regulate during the waning hours of the previous administration, the agency proposed a\u00a0regulation that would have imposed significant burdens on uranium miners and the communities they support,\u201d Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in the press release announcing the decision.Rep. John Barrasso (R-WY), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, praised the agency\u2019s move.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the right decision,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission \u2013 our nation\u2019s principal nuclear regulator \u2013 has said there is no health or safety justification for EPA\u2019s midnight rule.\u201d\u201cThe NRC has regulated in situ uranium recovery for nearly 40 years,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cThe agency has never found an instance of groundwater contamination that would be addressed by this rule.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged this reality,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cI applaud it for withdrawing this punishing and unnecessary regulation on America\u2019s uranium producers.\u201dThe proposed rule expressed concerns from federal partners, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and stakeholders, about the agency\u2019s legal authority under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978.\u201cToday\u2019s action underscores that EPA believes existing regulatory structures are sufficient at this time to ensure the protection of human health and the environment at current uranium in-situ recovery (ISR) activities,\u201d the press release stated. \u2018Today\u2019s withdrawal has no impact on EPA\u2019s regulation of radiation.\u201dThe proposed rulemaking document can be seen here.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter\nEnvironmentPoliticsAndrew WheelerBarack ObamaEPANuclear Regulatory CommissionRep.
