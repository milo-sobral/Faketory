{"id": "Andrew Gillum\u2019s Group Trained, Gave Award to Anti-Israel Dream Defenders\u2019 Founder", "paragraph": "A Breitbart News investigation published today documented that until last year, Gillum worked at the George Soros-financed People for the American Way, where he served as Director of Youth Leadership Programs from 2005 until January 13, 2017, and oversaw a radical training outfit calling itself Young People For, or YP4.Philip Agnew, the co-founder of Dream Defenders, is a 2005 graduate of Gillum\u2019s former YP4 group, it has emerged.Also, at a January 17, 2014 YP4 summit, Gillum\u2019s YP4 gave Agnew the Norman Lear Award, named after the producer and activist who founded People for the American Way.Gillum has faced controversy over his refusal to disavow Dream Defenders, which has engaged in activism to promote the boycott of Israel, and espouses anti-patriotic, anti-capitalism, anti-military, and anti-police ideology and with which Gillum has already been associated.Dream Defenders\u2019 website refers to the entire state of Israel as the \u201csite of a continued settler colonial project,\u201d and laments U.S. military aid to the Jewish state.\u00a0 A large section of the site promotes the group\u2019s anti-Israel activism.Breitbart News reported two weeks ago that Gillum\u2019s Dream Defenders allies compiled an education tool for U.S. teachers about \u201cliberation\u201d movements and that glorifies the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a deadly terrorist organization.Republican challenger Ron DeSantis has repeatedly called for Gillum to distance himself from Dream Defenders.During a debate nine days ago, Gillum claimed that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what DeSantis was referring to when he brought up a Dream Defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that supports a \u201cradical manifesto.\u201d\u201cThe fact is, Andrew signed a pledge with the Dream Defenders pledging his support, this radical manifesto,\u201d DeSantis said at the televised debate.\u201cI have no idea what pledge he is talking about,\u201d Gillum replied.Gillum\u2019s claim of ignorance about the pledge came despite his already known close relationship with Dream Defenders. Gillum has talked about aiding the group\u2019s activism and has written in strong support of Dream Defenders and its co-founder, Agnew. In turn, Agnew himself recently described a long and close working and personal relationship with Gillum and said he considers Gillum to be \u201cpart of the movement.\u201dGillum was taped at a June debate saying that he is \u201cpleased and proud\u201d to have sneaked food to Dream Defenders activists during a 30-day sleep-in protest at the Florida State Capital, referring to a 2013 month-long anti-gun protest in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting. \u201cI hope you keep at it,\u201d Gillum said of Dream Defenders activists during a June event.Now revelations about Gillum\u2019s former YP4 training outfit bring his association with Dream Defenders even closer.Not only is Agnew listed as an alum, Gillum himself penned a glowing 2014 profile at the far-left Alternet publication boasting about how Agnew graduated the 2005 inaugural class of Gillum\u2019s YP4. \u201cWe need more Phillip Agnews,\u201d was the title of the piece.Gillum wrote:Focused from the start on collaboration between progressive young people, Agnew\u2019s YP4 fellowship project was organizing a statewide, student-led coalition to lower tuition rates and increase Pell Grant funding in higher education. He worked with other young leaders across Florida to host a training preparing students to lead the advocacy for accessible higher education. Through the YP4 fellowship, he was introduced to critical social issues and learned how to conduct effective community organizing around these issues, including how to champion their message in the media. Agnew became an organizer with the Student Coalition for Justice, a cadre of students from Florida A&M University, Florida State University, and Tallahassee Community College angered by the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson at a Florida youth detention center.\u2026We must learn from the successes of young leaders like the Dream Defenders and recruit, train, and connect thousands more local organizers and activists, particularly in underrepresented communities and regions of the country.Breitbart News reported that Dream Defenders organized a flash mob in Israel to officially endorse the BDS movement against the Jewish state.In June 2018, Gillum signed a Dream Defenders pledge containing specific language stating, \u201cI pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.\u201d The organization\u2019s \u201cFreedom Papers,\u201d in turn, exclaim that \u201cpolice and prisons have no place in \u2018justice.\u2019\u201dThe Dream Defenders \u201cFreedom Papers\u201d also advocate textbook socialist principals such as claiming that \u201cby virtue of being born each of us has the absolute right to adequate food, shelter, clothing, water, healthcare, effective public transportation, dignified work, living wages.\u201dAs Breitbart News reported, a simple perusal of the website of Dream Defenders, the organization so feverishly championed by Gillum, evidences the group\u2019s open radicalism. The organization calls for an \u201cend\u201d to \u201cdisaster capitalism,\u201d rants against Independence Day and spreads anti-Israel charges.Much of that extremist rhetoric mirrors the phraseology posted on the official \u201cissues\u201d sections of the YP4 website while Gillum not only served as its active director, but while his picture, position and bio were brandished on the same site on the \u201cstaff\u201d page.The YP4 organization said its mission was to challenge U.S. \u201cpredatory capitalism,\u201d abolish the prison system, fight a \u201cspiritual resistance\u201d battle against \u201cChristian hegemony,\u201d redefine the meaning of \u201cborders\u201d while aiding \u201cundocumented\u201d aliens, and enact the \u201ccollective liberation\u201d of \u201ccommunities of color\u201d amid what it described as the scourge of \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201dGillum\u2019s group accused the U.S. of being a \u201ccolonialist\u201d power perpetrating \u201cstructural violence\u201d and \u201ccontinued genocide.\u201d It claimed conservatives in the U.S. judicial system were \u201cjustifying white supremacist policing practices.\u201dEven while he was a Tallahassee city commissioner and later the city\u2019s mayor, Gillum was heavily involved in the controversial YP4 youth leadership program as youth director, announcing multiple hires and headlining fundraising and group events.In his position of youth leadership director at PFAW, Gillum was in charge of both YP4, the organization\u2019s youth training program, and the organization\u2019s Young Elected Officials (YEO) Network, which he founded and which describes itself as \u201cthe first national program singularly-focused on providing a network of support to young progressive state and local elected officials.\u201dAt a PFAW dinner in 2011, Gillum said that even though he served as vice-mayor of Tallahassee at the time, his \u201cbest job\u201d was actually his position as the organization\u2019s youth director, where, he explained, he led YP4. He said his job there was to counter \u201cthe radical right,\u201d singling out Ann Coulter and Karl Rove as individuals who needed to be opposed.A review of an archived version of YP4\u2019s website from December 2016, while Gillum was still overseeing the group and while he was listed on the \u201cstaff\u201d page, finds a site bursting with extremist rhetoric. Much of the same language still exists on the current version of the group\u2019s website.The \u201cEconomic Justice\u201d section of Gillum\u2019s group\u2019s website demanded that activists challenge what it described as U.S. \u201cpredatory capitalism\u201d and instead work toward socialist-style economic ideals.That section, which is part of the mission of YP4, stated:We know that voracious predatory capitalism is a threat to the safety, well-being, and survival of our communities and our planet. As wages stagnate and intergenerational wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few, pathways to opportunity are becoming less and less accessible to the rest of us. At YP4, we are uniquely aware of the importance of challenging our system of predatory capitalism and working towards a set of institutional arrangements which allow us all to access the necessities of life \u2014 from housing, food, sustenance, and healthcare.In that spirit, we are committed to supporting the work of organized labor, cooperative economists, and those organizing against politics of austerity, both in the US and abroad. We believe in leveraging the power of our network to support Fellows engaged in this work \u2014 from those doing worker organizing to those providing direct services to under-resourced communities and researching tax justice issues.One \u201cissues\u201d section of the website accuses the U.S. government of being a colonialist power which must be held to account for perpetrating \u201cstructural violence\u201d and \u201ccontinued genocide.\u201dGillum\u2019s YP4 said it \u201coperates daily with the understanding that the lands upon which our movements organize\u2013\u2013 and upon which our own offices are situated \u2013\u2013 have been ripped from the hands of their historical inhabitants through the sustained, continued genocide of Native and indigenous peoples.\u201d\u201cBy stripping Native Tribes of their sovereignty, divesting resources from indigenous communities, and consigning Native peoples to the dustbins of history, the U.S. government and agents of imperialism continue to perpetuate the structural violence which began hundreds of years ago,\u201d continued the site. \u201cYP4 believes strongly that we as an organization have an obligation to name our complicity in colonialism, support Native activists in their necessary work, and hold communities of colonizers accountable to our actions.\u201dThe organization implies illegal activism is acceptable: \u201cAs freedom fighters committed to lasting, meaningful change, we know that, while legal change cannot be the sole path to liberation, it is certainly a tool for agents of social justice seeking to reduce the harm of repressive legislation and winning long-withheld constitutional rights.\u201dThe \u201cRacial Justice\u201d section of Gillum\u2019s website called for no less than the \u201cthe liberation of communities of color in this country and around the world,\u201d and deployed socialist rhetoric demanding \u201ccollective liberation\u201d amid the \u201cobligation to state clearly that white supremacy kills.\u201dGillum\u2019s group exclaimed on its website that \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d manifests in \u201ccolonialism, imperialism, slavery, and voracious predatory capitalism.\u201dGillum\u2019s group called on activists to emulate the work of Dream Defenders, which, it said, fights \u201ca prison industrial complex that disproportionately affects people of color.\u201dThe \u201cCommunity Safety, Police Brutality, and Prison Abolition\u201d section calls for what the title implies \u2014 an end to the U.S. prison system. Gillum\u2019s group said it was working toward \u201cending the carceral State and challenging the presupposition that our communities are made safer when our fellow human beings are locked in cages.\u201dYP4 rhetoric warned of \u201cpolice forces procur[ing] increasingly militarized arsenals, and prosecutors shield[ing] police officers who\u2019ve murdered members of the neighborhoods they purport to serve.\u201dThe \u201cSpiritual Resistance\u201d mission section calls for the \u201cbirthing\u201d of a \u201cmovement for transformative justice\u201d working to \u201cpush back against Christian hegemony which alienates and belittles other spiritual traditions.\u201dThe \u201cImmigration\u201d page says the Gillum\u2019s group believes global events should cause \u201ccritical conversations around the ways our movements conceptualize and articulate issues of empire, national identity, and the construct of borders.\u201d In the U.S., Gillum\u2019s group said it works to \u201csupport young undocumented people, efforts to expand and protect immigrants\u2019 access to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA), as well as campaigns to halt the deportations of undocumented peoples and families.\u201dThe \u201cLegal and Judicial Activism\u201d mission page accuses \u201cconservative legal opposition\u201d in the U.S. of \u201csuppressing the vote, expanding the role of money in politics, reinforcing patriarchal and heteronormative policies\u201d and \u201cjustifying white supremacist policing practices.\u201dThe \u201ceducation\u201d section of the YP4 website advocated \u201calternatives to formal education\u201d with the \u201craising\u201d of \u201cpolitical consciousness throughout liberation movements.\u201dGillum could not stay at PFAW since the organization cannot legally be involved in partisan politics. But when he depoarted PFAW he didn\u2019t go very far. He instead joined P&P Communications, a leadership consulting firm in Tallahassee founded by Sharon Lettman-Hicks, who served as Executive Vice President at the PFAW Foundation and reportedly recruited Gillum in 2002 to the PFAW. \u201cWe recruited him because of his advocacy and tenacity as a student leader,\u201d she said.PFAW has been aiding Gillum\u2019s mayoral campaign, and described how it helped him win the democratic primary earlier this year:Gillum is endorsed by PFAW\u2019s Next Up Victory Fund, a program that helps young progressives win state and local elections. In the closing weeks of the primary, PFAW sent on-the-ground organizers to Florida to push people to the polls in support of Gillum. The group also launched a series of social media advertisements promoting his campaign.Gillum, Lettman-Hicks and Dream Defenders\u2019 Agnew each are graduates of an Oakland, California-based training school for progressive revolutionaries that has spawned a list of activists who have gone on to become the who\u2019s who of the far-left leadership world, with many taking senior positions at organizations financed by Soros.In scores of cases, graduates of the Rockwood Leadership Institute founded or directed notorious Soros-financed activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org and the Tides Foundation, one of the nation\u2019s largest funders of progressive groups. Soros\u2019s own Open Society Foundations sent top staff to Rockwood for training. Notorious radicals Van Jones and Linda Sarsour are among the many famous names listed as alums.Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
