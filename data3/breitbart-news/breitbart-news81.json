{"id": "Report: Islamic State Foreign Fighters Galvanizing Local Jihadis in Philippines", "paragraph": "The Guardian noted, \u201cThe presence of foreign fighters is known to energize and embolden local pro-ISIS groups and there are increasing concerns of a renewed bid to declare a caliphate in Mindanao.\u201dIn October, the Washington Times, citing the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), reported that there are more Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-linked foreign fighters in Southeast Asia now, namely in the Mindanao region, than there ever were during the peak of the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.According to a recent assessment of U.S. military operations in support of the Filipino government\u2019s efforts against ISIS conducted by the Pentagon\u2019s office of the inspector general (OIG), the number of fighters from the terrorist group has increased from 200 to 500 in the last few months.Citing Rommel Banlaoi, chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, the Guardian estimated that between 40 and 100 of the ISIS jihadis are foreign fighters mainly from neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia but also Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Middle East.\u201cMany seek the relative sanctuary of the southern Philippines,\u201d Zachary Abuza, south-east Asia analyst at the National War College, told the Guardian, referring to the foreign fighters. \u201cThere they can regroup, train and plot attacks. With ISIS\u2019s declaration of an east Asia wilayah, the southern Philippines becomes more important because there is enough ungoverned or very poorly governed space.\u201d\u201cThere are ISIS cells in Malaysia and Singapore, but they don\u2019t control any territory,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t be [a] province of the caliphate without territory.\u201dFurthermore, the fall of the group\u2019s so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria has also prompted \u201can unprecedented number of Europeans, including those from the UK, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland\u201d to attempt to travel to join ISIS in the Philippines this year, the Guardian revealed.\u201cForeign fighters are in the Philippines because they consider the country, particularly Mindanao, as a safe haven, alternative home base and a new land of jihad,\u201d Banlaoi said.\u201cThey train and learn from local fighters. They provide funds. They provide a global support network,\u201d he continued.The Guardian warned of continued support for ISIS among local Muslims in Mindanao, home to the five-month siege by the Filipino army to retake Marawi from the jihadist group in October 2017, a successful offensive that left more than 1,000 people dead.Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, told the Guardian, \u201cThe risk of violence continues to be very high, more from local pro-Isis elements.\u201dAlthough \u201cISIS-Philippines (ISIS-P) remained fragmented and degraded\u201d and \u201chas not controlled any territory since its defeat in that conflict, various factions [linked to the terrorist group] carried out opportunistic acts of violence against civilians and security personnel,\u201d the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) IG noted in a press release announcing a report issued last Monday.The IG acknowledged that \u201cthe group has been without a unified leadership or command structure since the end of the 2017 siege of Marawi\u201d when the Philippine military killed\u00a0the leaders of the nation\u2019s two ISIS affiliates \u2014 Isnilon Hapilon of Abu Sayyaf and Omar Maute of the Maute group.The Guardian noted that the old and new ISIS arrivals on the Christian-majority island nation are trying to want re-establish the east Asia wilayah (or East Asia ISIS province) crushed by the Filipino army in October 2017.In 2018, the Pentagon spent more than $100 million on Operation Pacific Eagle \u2013 Philippines (OPE-P), the official mission in support of the island nation\u2019s efforts against ISIS. There are 250 U.S. troops supporting the OPE-P mission.\nAsiaIsrael / Middle EastNational SecurityISISIslamic StateMarawiMindanaoPhilippinesradical islam .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
