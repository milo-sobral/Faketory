Hillary Clinton should be locked up. John Brennan should lose his clearance. CNN is the enemy of the people. And blames Obama for everything. They\u2019re lives were all threatened. You do the math.

And blames Obama for everything. They\u2019re lives were all threatened. You do the math. VOTE!!!\u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) October 24, 2018The nation was rocked by news that multiple Democratic politicians and George Soros, as well as the New York City headquarters of CNN, received makeshift bombs in the mail.The events of this week come after hundreds of instances of harassment and violence directed at Trump supporters, as Breitbart News\u2019 John Nolte has chronicled.Indeed, Maxine Waters encouraged the harassment of Trump officials over the summer, saying, \u201cIf you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. You push back on them. Tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere!\u201dHillary Clinton also recently rejected calls for civility, saying,\u00a0\u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u00a0believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that\u2019s when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201dSen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was also recently harassed in a restaurant. Sen. Ted Cruz was also recently ran out of a restaurant by a crowd of rabid leftists, to the delight of CNN.\nBut many in Hollywood have only spoken up for \u201ccivility\u201d now, when Democrats and the establishment media are targeted.\u201cA recap: Yes, the caravan is definitely full of MS-13 and Middle-Eastern terrorists. No, the bombs sent to Clinton, Obama, CNN that are physically in the possession of the Secret Service are not real. I miss facts,\u201d actor Kumail Nanjiani tweeted.A recap:Yes, the caravan is definitely full of MS-13 and Middle-Eastern terrorists.No, the bombs sent to Clinton, Obama, CNN that are physically in the possession of the Secret Service are not real.I miss facts.\u2014 Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) October 24, 2018Star Trek star George Takei tweeted, \u201cCall me crazy, but that bomb intended for John Brennan\u2014he only appears now and then on CNN. He\u2019s actually signed as a contributor at MSNBC. Guess this gives an indication of the bomber\u2019s intelligence.\u201dCall me crazy, but that bomb intended for John Brennan\u2014he only appears now and then on CNN.

But that didn\u2019t stop celebrities from assigning blame. Check out all the Hollywood hysteria.You and your boss are responsible for this. He constantly calls the press \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d He pretended to wrestle a CNN reporter at a vanity rally. He decries \u201cfake news\u201d when they point out his lies. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. Coward. Sellout. Danger. All describe you. https://t.co/n4922DcFAH\u2014 Vote November 6th (@SophiaBush) October 24, 2018Whenever they say false flag, they are proclaiming their own victimhood, ie \u201cour side\u2019s leaders & media didn\u2019t incite potential bombings by constantly demonizing the specific ppl targeted; they sent them to themselves to pick on us!\u201d Personal responsibility, you sick cowards?\u2014 Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) October 24, 2018the dems sure are diabolical to send those devices to these particular ppl, possibly killing them, in an attempt to place the blame on right-wing zealots so that \u2026 uh \u2026 the mid-terms will, um \u2026 so that trump can \u2026 uh \u2026 wait, why would they do it again\u2026? https://t.co/rj14AmbCk9\u2014 Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) October 24, 2018Soros is part of a liberal worldwide conspiracy (of Jews). Obama\u2019s not a legitimate President. Hillary is a crook who should be locked up.  CNN is the dishonest enemy of the people. Putin? Kim Jung Un?  MBS? Good people. Strong people.

But that is why Trump and the WH must stop inciting violence and dividing and must start uniting! https://t.co/BzgHpEIiY7\u2014 John Leguizamo (@JohnLeguizamo) October 24, 2018This morning bombs were sent to Obama, the Clintons, George Sauros, and CNN. Coincidence? Or a blatant pattern. While the press secretary intones through here crooked mouth how abhorrent this act is. While her boss is between Nationalist Rallies.\u2014 Ron Perlman (@perlmutations) October 24, 2018Today a bomb was mailed to the Obamas, and to the Clintons, and to CNN, a few days ago one was sent to George Sorros. If the the left is 'mob' does that make the right terrorists? https://t.co/dGeXyB7aaG\u2014 Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) October 24, 2018A journalist was killed and dismembered a couple weeks ago.

This is the end result. On November 6th, u have a choice. You can either give a blank check & say this rhetoric is ok or you can send a loud message that there r consequences 4 normalizing hate https://t.co/FscjlLd7g6\u2014 Josh Gad (@joshgad) October 24, 2018Explosive Devises sent to Clinton, Obama and Soros- Call out this dangerous escalation on the right. @marcorubio @gop @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr @SteveScalise https://t.co/QWPHeUslQ1\u2014 Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) October 24, 2018This added to CNN \"s bomb threats\u2026Is this  NOT what our Pres has whistles  about https://t.co/GsP23XeqLe\u2014 Henry Winkler (@hwinkler4real) October 24, 2018Trump made a list.
