{"id": "Joe Donnelly Embraces Barack Obama Despite Donnelly Obfuscating His Democrat Affiliation", "paragraph": "Obama will campaign for Donnelly in Gary, Indiana, on Sunday to reassure the deep-red state that Hoosiers should re-elect the incumbent Democrat to the U.S. Senate.Hoosier businessman and Donnelly\u2019s Republican challenger, Mike Braun, released a campaign statement on Sunday charging that Donnelly continues to double-down with the \u201cliberal resistance movement by campaigning with Obama.\u201cAfter joining the angry liberal mob against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mexico Joe Donnelly is doubling-down with the liberal resistance movement by campaigning with Barack Obama,\u201d Josh Kelley, Braun\u2019s campaign spokesman, said in a statement on Sunday.\u201cWhile Hoosier job creator Mike Braun proudly stands with President Trump, it\u2019s Mexico Joe Donnelly who has supported Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, served as a superdelegate for Hillary Clinton and stands with Barack Obama\u2019s liberal philosophy,\u201d Kelley added.Donnelly\u2019s embrace of Obama strikes a stark contrast from a June interview with NPR, in which he stressed he was a bipartisan lawmaker representing Hoosier interests.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to tie myself to one label or another label. My label is a Hoosier label. My label as an American label,\u201d Donnelly told NPR. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we all should be doing.\u201dIn an October ad, Donnelly criticized \u201csocialists\u201d who want government-run health care and the \u201cradical left\u201d who wants to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.Donnelly\u2019s criticism of government-run health care contrasts with Obama, who embraced the socialized healthcare scheme as a \u201cgood new idea\u201d during a speech in September.One study from the Mercatus Center found that Medicare for All would cost at least $38 trillion and even doubling the federal income tax would not pay for the Medicare for All\u2019s immense costs.Despite Donnelly labeling himself as a bipartisan lawmaker who represents Hoosier interests in the Senate, Donnelly voted against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court even though a plurality of Hoosiers wanted Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.Braun has attacked Donnelly for attacking free-trade and how it has hollowed out American manufacturing, while Donnelly\u2019s family business has outsourced jobs to Mexico. The Hoosier businessman told Breitbart News that Donnelly exhibited the \u201cultimate level of hypocrisy\u201d by attacking his business while outsourcing Hoosier jobs to Mexico.Last year the Associated Press (AP)\u00a0reported\u00a0that while Sen. Donnelly chastised Carrier Crop. for moving manufacturing jobs to Mexico, he profited from a family business that relied on Mexican labor to produce dye for ink pads.Donnelly, during his first run for the House in 2004, railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and called \u201coutsourcing,\u201d \u201ca fancy term for \u2018Someone in Indiana has just lost their job.\u201dThe Hoosier businessman then said that, similar to President Trump, \u201cI have a business background and we get things fixed with hard decisions when you need to, put up some short-term pains for long-term gains and prosperity that comes with good decision making.\u201d\nMidterm ElectionPoliticsBarack ObamaJoe DonnellyMike Braun .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
