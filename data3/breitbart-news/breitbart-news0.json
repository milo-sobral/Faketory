Cortez-Masto, Senate candidate Jacky Rosen, and gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak. pic.twitter.com/3a4p022t0q\u2014 John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) October 20, 2018We\u2019re at the Culinary Union HQ waiting for former Vice President Joe Biden to show up for an early voting rally and to campaign for Nevada Democrats. pic.twitter.com/6Id0hclcKQ\u2014 Nina Porciuncula (@NinaReports) October 20, 2018Long lines and big crowds at the #Trump rally in Elko. pic.twitter.com/O8ONxzd1BG\u2014 John T.
