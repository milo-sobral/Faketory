{"id": "\u2018This Is a War\u2019: Republican Katie Arrington on Contentious South Carolina Race", "paragraph": "Arrington, who faces off against Joe Cunningham (D) in November, said the Democrats are \u201cNancy Pelosi desperate\u201d and even started a rumor that she faked breast cancer as election day approaches in South Carolina.After being involved in a deadly car crash in June, Arrington returned with a thank you message to all who supported her through recovery. In the advertisement, because\u00a0it was set to be released in October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Arrington mentioned she was a breast cancer survivor.\u201cBecause I never mentioned it publicly before, my opponent, his team, his campaign minions actually went out and started a rumor campaign to all of the news outlets\u2013the AP, the local media\u2013that I had never mentioned it before,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cSo I actually got a reporter to come up to me in the middle of a parking lot and basically accuse me of lying, and my response was \u2018Let\u2019s step in the restroom. I\u2019ll show you my scars.'\u201dArrington stated that she and her team have both asked her opponent, Joe Cunningham (D), to denounce the rumor.She also pointed out the dangers in \u201cSoros and Nancy Pelosi funding these campaigns across the country.\u201d\u201cThis is a war. I hate that it has come to this, but this is a war. Do we want a country where socialism is the word of the day?\u201d\u201cIf we had that, that socialized medicine as they want to see it, I wouldn\u2019t be on the phone with you. The night of the accident at 45 seconds in, I flatlined out. With socialized medicine, they wouldn\u2019t have worked to revive me,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cAll I wanted was a chance to live, and that\u2019s what the Democrats want to take from us.\u201dArrington also outlined how she believes our healthcare system could be better controlled.\u201cWell, first and foremost, we need to have the capability to buy insurance from across state lines. That\u2019s ridiculous. We need to have the free market to be able to do that. Secondly, we need transparency in billing. People need to know what they\u2019re paying for.\u201dArrington, who says she is \u201c100 percent repeal and replace\u201d on Obamacare, also mentioned small businesses and the impact health care is having on them.\u201cWhen Obamacare came out, we penalized the small business owners at their best asset they had; their number one asset was their employees,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cWe need to incentivize small businesses and be able to support them buying good quality health care for their best asset, their employees.\u201dArrington also spoke about the future of the Supreme Court.\u201cWe all know that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is, you know, her days are numbered,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cWe could potentially have another Supreme Court justice in the next two years, and they\u2019re going to work to ensure that they do not get conservatives on the bench.\u201dArrington also discussed the media\u2019s bias in covering the contentious race.\u201cI had nine African American Democrats come out and endorse me, and the local media here won\u2019t pick it up.\u201dAfter Arrington suffered the tragic car wreck, Democrat Joe Cunningham said he would suspend his campaign. He did not, according to Arrington.\u201cIt absolutely floors me how every tragic event in this campaign, [Cunningham] has tried to stand up and use it for free media for him,\u201d said Arrington. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a card or flowers or him stopping by the house to see how I am.\u201dArrington described Cunningham as \u201cnot doing anything for our nation, having nothing to offer other than negativity, division, higher taxes, and less jobs.\u201dListen to Katie Arrington on Breitbart News Saturday\u00a0on\u00a0SiriusXM 125:\nPoliticshealth careJoe CunninghamKatie ArringtonNancy PelosiObamacareSouth Carolina First Congressional District .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
