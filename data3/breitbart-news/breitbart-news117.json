The White House is \u2014 their argument was clearly ridiculous, that they can totally control, when they\u2019re just doing a public service, they\u2019re part of a public servant. On the other hand, if there is some complete troublemaker\u2026who has reported \u2014 becomes a reporter, that person doesn\u2019t get to monopolize the room. \u2026 Nobody in that White House room is well outside the bounds right now.\u201dHe concluded, \u201cAnd so, the one extreme, which was the White House position, is clearly wrong. The other extreme, that anybody should have complete access, that is also wrong. It\u2019s just a question of discretion.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nPoliticsVideoCNNDonald Trumpfreedom of the pressJim Acosta .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
