{"id": "CNN\u2019s Marc Lamont Hill Condemns Louis Farrakhan After Photo Together Surfaces", "paragraph": "The Wrap reported Friday that the CNN commentator was in a photo with Louis Farrakhan on a website selling a box-set of music.Hill told The Wrap that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be used to promote anybody\u2019s materials,\u201d and that he would \u201cask for it to be taken down as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s consistent with my values and my professional standards.\u201dHe also said that the photo of him and Farrakhan together was taken in fall of 2016 at an event to promote the music and that he now denounces Farrakhan\u2019s views, seemingly comparing the racist, anti-Semitic NOI leader to Fox News in the process.\u201cI worked on Fox News for years, having conversations with people I disagree with, people who said and did things I thought were racist, sexist and xenophobic, but I had conversations with them because I thought it was important,\u201d Hill said.Hill\u2019s past association with Farrakhan has come after the hateful minister made headlines for proclaiming that he\u2019s not an \u201canti-semite,\u201d but is instead, \u201canti-termite.\u201dI'm not an anti-Semite. I\u2019m anti-Termite. pic.twitter.com/L5dPQcnVg4\u2014 MINISTER FARRAKHAN (@LouisFarrakhan) October 16, 2018This clip went viral and prompted some to ask why Farrakhan is still allowed on many social media platforms.However, Farrakhan\u2019s history of hate goes back much further than one clip. Louis Farrakhan has a long history of making hateful statements against Jews, white people, and gays and lesbians.Farrakhan has praised Adolf Hitler in a speech in 1984. \u201cThe Jews don\u2019t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u2019s a good name. Hitler was a very great man,\u201d he said.Farrakhan has also said that white people \u201cdeserve to die.\u201dHill took to Twitter Saturday to explain his position on Farrakhan, saying that he disagrees with his statements about LGBT people and Jews, but that he \u201cwill not allow that to be an excuse for allowing dishonest media or poorly intentioned observers to create unnecessary division.\u201d\u201cI will not be told who to speak to, sit with, or engage,\u201d he said.Although I disagree with the Minister on those important issues, I will not allow that to be an excuse for allowing dishonest media or poorly intentioned observers to create unnecessary division. I will not be told who to speak to, sit with, or engage.\u2014 Marc Lamont Hill (@marclamonthill) October 20, 2018He also said, \u201cBlack people are the only group who are demanded to throw people away, rather than critically engage and challenge them. Regardless of what headlines say, that is not my position.\u201dBlack people are the only group who are demanded to throw people away, rather than critically engage and challenge them.
