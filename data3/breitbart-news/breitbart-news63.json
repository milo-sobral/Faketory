{"id": "Massive Crowd Comes for Trump\u2019s Late-Election Push in Georgia", "paragraph": "Several thousand lined up hours early to see Trump make his closing argument for Georgia Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp, who faces Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams on Tuesday.(Jeff Poor/Breitbart News)The president emphasized the importance of Tuesday\u2019s election right away after taking the stage and boasted about the \u201celectricity in the air\u201d as it approaches.\u201cThis is one of the most important elections of our lifetime,\u201d Trump said during his introduction. \u201cThis is a very important election. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as important as 2016, but it\u2019s right up there. It\u2019s right up there. It really is. It\u2019s become so incredible, and there is electricity in the air like I haven\u2019t seen since the 2016 big victory that we all had together.\u201d\u201cIncredible electricity,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd in fact, speaking of that, could I ask \u2014 look at this. It\u2019s like the Academy Awards. Look at how many cameras. Could I ask you to turn around and shoot? They don\u2019t have to do this with other celebrities when they come here that don\u2019t have very big crowds. Look at the people back there. Shoot it. You\u2019ve got to shoot it.\u201dTrump listed the progress Georgia had made since his inauguration and urged attendees to elect Kemp to ensure it continues.\u201cJobless claims in Georgia just fell to their lowest level in 45 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMore Georgia workers are employed today than at any time or any point in American history. Think of that.\u00a0Do you want to see that end quickly? Do you want to see Georgia prosperity end quickly? Vote for the Democrat. She\u2019ll end it quickly. She will end it quickly, and she\u2019ll double up your taxes, and a lot of bad things will happen. We passed a massive tax cut for Georgia families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle-class. We\u2019re working on that now.\u201d(Jeff Poor/Breitbart News)\u201cHere in Georgia, the great news just keeps rolling in,\u201d he continued. \u201cJobs are going up. Crime is going down. Wages are rising, the first time in many years. You saw that in the report on Friday. Poverty is plummeting, and confidence is at an all-time high. Other than that, we\u2019re not doing very well. Under Republican leadership, Georgia is safer, Georgia is stronger, and Georgia is winning like never before. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I know Brian. He will take it to new heights, heights that you wouldn\u2019t even believe. I know him. This guy doesn\u2019t stop, which is what you want. He\u2019s an incredible manager. He\u2019s been successful all the way up and down the line. This man will bring it to heights that you wouldn\u2019t believe, even today with those great numbers.\u201d(Jeff Poor/Breitbart News)The president also reminded rallygoers about now-Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process in the U.S. Senate, which some political watchers say gave Republicans a late-campaign surge in the polls. He also mentioned that one of Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers had backtracked on her story.\u201cTo protect your rights and freedoms, we overcame the Democrat smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d he said. \u201cBoy, did he get treated badly. The Democrats treated him so badly, so unfair. And did you see what happened on Friday? You know what I\u2019m talking about, right? They knew \u2014 you knew that before. You knew that these three women, they knew that before. They knew that a long time ago. So, a woman, who accused then Judge Kavanaugh of horrible, horrible crimes admitted that actually she never met Judge Kavanaugh or Brett Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh period. Never met him, never saw him and the act never happened, and it was a lie. It was a total lie. She made up the story, and she was forced to admit it.\u201dTrump also touched on immigration, one of the key planks in his 2016 campaign election platform and warned if Democrats were elected, they would seek to \u201ctotally erase America\u2019s borders,\u201d among other things.(Jeff Poor/Breitbart News)\u201cThey want to take away and destroy your health care because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, impose socialism and totally erase America\u2019s borders,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about that caravan? Do you want to let that caravan just pour in? I don\u2019t think so. So we started the wall. $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion just approved. We\u2019re building it in pieces and chunks, but I want to build it all at one time. In the meantime, you saw last week I called up the United States military. We\u2019re not playing games, folks. There\u2019s no games because you look at what\u2019s marching up, that\u2019s an invasion. That\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s an invasion.\u201d(Jeff Poor/Breitbart News)After the Macon event, Trump headed to Chattanooga, TN for a Sunday evening event, and wraps up his campaign rally tour with stops in Cleveland, Fort Wayne, IN and Cape Girardeau, MO on Monday.In the Georgia race, polling has been mixed. However,\u00a0the Real Clear Politics polling average\u00a0has Kemp with a slight advantage over Abrams. But if Sunday\u2019s rally is any indication, there\u2019s no lack of enthusiasm among Republicans as Tuesday approaches.A midterm election rally pic.twitter.com/wXVjhk9dK4\u2014 Jeff Poor (@jeff_poor) November 4, 2018Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\nMidterm ElectionPoliticsBrian KempDonald TrumpGeorgiaMaconStacey Abrams .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
