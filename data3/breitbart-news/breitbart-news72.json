{"id": "Watch\u2013Pat Buchanan: Birthright Citizenship Allowing Illegal Aliens to Increase U.S. Population", "paragraph": "Last week,\u00a0President\u00a0Trump announced\u00a0that he is readying an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. The unilateral move would carry the U.S. into the future on the issue, putting the nation more in line with similar Western countries.During a segment on\u00a0The McLaughlin Group, Buchanan said the birthright citizenship policy allows illegal aliens to increase the U.S. population which is set to reach an unprecedented 404 million by 2060 if legal immigration levels are not reduced.\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is, look people come into this country, birthright tourism, fly in, have their baby here, and go back home and they say \u2018I\u2019ve created an American citizen,'\u201d Buchanan said of birthright citizenship.\u201cYou\u2019ve got all these benefits and things that American citizens rightly have and we voted and they can come in and increase the population illegally by 250,000 a year,\u201d Buchanan said.The\u00a0latest data\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants. The last great wave of immigration to the U.S. was followed by a near immigration moratorium.Recent research by NumbersUSA reveals that should current legal immigration levels continue \u2014 where the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals every year \u2014 the country\u2019s population will double what it was in 1970.The NumbersUSA research notes that the quality of life in America, with an additional 75 million residents living in the U.S. will be greatly reduced. Such a drastic population increase is likely to increase highway traffic, increase housing prices, increase the density of communities, and destroy large regions of farmland that will need to be inhabited to house the booming population.The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars\u00a0dispute\u00a0the idea. The total anchor baby population exceeds the annual\u00a0roughly 4 million\u00a0American babies born every year.Many leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.
