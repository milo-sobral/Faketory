{"id": "Andrew Gillum Suggests Racism Behind Scrutiny of Corruption Probe", "paragraph": "The FBI agent reportedly posed as a developer investigating corruption tied to the city of Tallahassee, where Gillum serves as mayor.Gillum responded to the release of the documents by claiming, \u201cThe goal is obviously to use my candidacy as a way to reinforce, frankly, stereotypes about black men.\u201dGillum made the remarks during a Facebook Live video.He further stated:These messages only confirm what we have said all along.\u00a0 We did go to see Hamilton.\u00a0 I did get my ticket for Hamilton from my brother.\u00a0 At the time, we believed that they were reserved by friends of Adam\u2019s, Mike Miller, and when I got there after work got my ticket, we went in and saw, it assumed my brother paid for it and so far as I know that was the deal.The issue at hand revolves around how Gillum obtained the Broadway tickets and questions about payments for trips to New York City and Costa Rica.Gillum has maintained that he believed his brother, and not the undercover agent, \u201cMike Miller,\u201d paid for the ticket.However, records released as part of a subpoena by the lawyer for former Florida lobbyist Adam Corey, a longtime Gillum ally, seem to paint a different picture. \u00a0Gillum attended the Broadway show along with his brother, Corey, and \u201cMiller,\u201d the undercover FBI agent.\u201cJust checking in with you. Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at 8 p.m.,\u201d Corey texted Gillum on Aug. 10, 2016, according to the records.Gillum replied: \u201cAwesome news about Hamilton.\u201d\u201cThis is what local corruption looks like,\u201d DeSantis said earlier today on Fox News.\u201cHe claims he\u2019s not under investigation,\u201d DeSantis added. \u201cWhy the heck would law enforcement send an undercover agent to line his pockets if he wasn\u2019t under investigation? Of course he is.\u201dThe issue took center stage during Sunday\u2019s debate between Gillum and DeSantis during which DeSantis directly asked: \u201cDid you pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket, or did the undercover FBI agent pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket?\u201dGillum sidestepped the question with an indirect response. \u201cWe all have friends that sometimes let us down,\u201d Gillum, referring to Corey.\u201cI\u2019m a hard-working person,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do.\u201dAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
