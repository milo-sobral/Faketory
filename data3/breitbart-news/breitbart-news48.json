Laxalt countered the claims Tuesday. He pointed to Reno Gazette-Journal and Las Vegas Review-Journal articles calling Sisolak a \u201cbully\u201d and \u201cpolitical bulldozer.\u201dSisolak\u2019s ad claims Laxalt would allow insurance companies to deny pre-existing condition coverage. Laxalt rejected the claim, pledging to protect such coverage.Laxalt\u2019s mom, who is in the final stages of multiple sclerosis, addressed her son\u2019s position on pre-existing conditions in a recent ad. \u201cI\u2019m a single mother. I raised Adam and his sisters alone. I\u2019ve had MS for the course of my son\u2019s life. I\u2019m into the latest stages,\u201d she says. \u201cSteve Sisolak is a career politician. When he says my son would deprive you of pre-existing condition coverage, he\u2019s a liar. I am a pre-existing condition.\u201dLaxalt goes on to counter Sisolak\u2019s charge that the Attorney General fought against Governor Brian Sandoval over school funding. Not true, Laxalt\u2019s campaign contended, clarifying that he disagreed on a commerce tax not earmarked for education. The campaign further pledged, \u201che\u2019ll commit $500 million in new funding that will go into the classroom where it belongs, and will give parents more educational options for their children \u2014 all while keeping taxes low.\u201d\u201cSteve Sisolak\u2019s only solution is to raise taxes. He\u2019s promised to increase property taxes on Nevada families. And the only thing he\u2019s ever done for schools is double student tuition while on the Board of Regents,\u201d Laxalt\u2019s campaign argued.Laxalt\u2019s campaign released their own ad focused on his actions fixing a rape kit problem in the state, protection of veterans, and prosecution of elder abuse and sex traffickers.The race between Republican Laxalt and Democrat Sisolak has been extremely tight, nearly tied in most recent polls that show Laxalt with an approximate one point lead that is within the margin of error. RealClearPolitics rates the race a toss-up.This month allegations surfaced that Sisolak had physically abused his now ex-wife. Despite the allegations, former President Barack Obama and Democrat Senate candidate Jacky Rosen campaigned for Sisolak last week. Obama has contended that Democrats can use the midterm elections to \u201crestore some sanity to our politics.\u201dMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook\nHealthMidterm ElectionPoliticsAdam LaxalthealthcareObamacarepre-existing conditionsSteve Sisolak .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
