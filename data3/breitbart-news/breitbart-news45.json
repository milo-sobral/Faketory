{"id": "Brazil: Imprisoned Socialist Ex-President Calls for Calm Following Bolsonaro Win", "paragraph": "On Monday morning, PT\u2019s\u00a0national secretary of finance Em\u00eddio de Souza and lawyer Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh visited Lula in jail, where he is currently serving a 12-year sentence for\u00a0taking over $1 million in bribes in a corruption scandal that rocked the country and led to dozens of arrests. After meeting with the 73-year-old convict, they said that Lula was \u201ccalm\u201d about the election result and urged other people to remain so as well.\u201cNobody is happy with such a result. But he is normal, easygoing,\u201d De Souza said of Lula\u2019s mindset. \u201cWe have already won and we have already lost.\u201dLula reportedly maintained that Bolsonaro\u2019s victory presented an opportunity for the left to put together a united front transcending party politics against his presidency, which he has denounced as a \u201cfascist adventure.\u201d Bolsonaro has promised to radically reform Brazil with a crackdown on crime and corruption, a return to religious values, and tearing apart former administration\u2019s socialist economic policy.Socialist leader Fernando Haddad is yet to visit Lula in prison following his election defeat, which he lost convincingly with around 45 percent of the vote. During the meeting on Monday, Lula reportedly backed Haddad to lead the opposition through the Bolsonaro presidency, although there remains debate\u00a0among the leftist establishment over whether he is the right man to do so given his election defeat.\u201cHaddad came out as a great leader, came out with the stature to be a national leader.\u00a0Before, there was only Lula,\u201d the Worker\u2019s Party President in Rio de Janeiro, Washington Quaqu\u00e1, told Veja.\u00a0\u201cHaddad has become a great interlocutor with society and is worthy of leading a democratic front.\u00a0This is Lula\u2019s position as well.\u201dHaddad visited Lula behind bars to discuss their election strategy the day after cementing a place in the final run-off vote. Lula had previously planned to run for office from jail until Brazil\u2019s \u201cClean Slate Law,\u201d which prevents politicians convicted of corruption crimes from running for office,\u201d banned him from doing so.Bolsonaro has vowed that the \u201cdrunkard\u201d Lula will continue to \u201crot in jail,\u201d alongside other socialists guilty of corruption in jail. He also repeatedly warned that Haddad planned to ensure the release of Lula and other left-wing allies.\u201cEither they go overseas, or they go to jail,\u201d Bolsonaro said at a campaign rally.\u00a0\u201cThese red outlaws will be banished from our homeland. It will be a clean up the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.\u201dFollow Ben Kew on\u00a0Facebook, Twitter at\u00a0@ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\nLatin AmericaNational SecurityBrazilFernando HaddadJair BolsonaroLula da SilvaWorkers' Party .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
