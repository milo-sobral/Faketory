{"id": "Joy Behar: \u2018Psycho\u2019 Trump Is an \u2018Anarchist\u2019 \u2014 Republicans are \u2018Vicious\u2019", "paragraph": "Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat,\u201d comedian Joy Behar called President Donald Trump a \u201cpsycho\u201d and an \u201canarchist.\u201dDiscussing being friends with Trump when he was a New York real estate mogul, Behar said, \u201cWho knew he was such a psycho? I liked the guy in a way. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh he is a New York character.'\u201dShe continued, \u201cObviously, I never thought that he would be this bad, never. Even before he won, I said, well, if he wins, God forbid, he can\u2019t be really such a maniac. He\u2019s much worse.\u201dShe added, \u201cI think he\u2019s worse. I thought he was also a secret Democrat, which he shows us he\u2019s not. He is not a Republican or a Democrat. He\u2019s just an anarchist as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201dOn the Republican Party leadership, Behar said, \u201cThe Republicans are vicious. Mitch McConnell, I don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe\u2019s like an improv comic. He makes it up as he goes along. \u2018Oh today, I think I\u2019ll change this rule, and I think I\u2019ll change that law,\u2019 and everybody says OK.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nEntertainmentVideoDonald TrumpJoy Behar .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
