{"id": "Joy Reid: \u2018Interesting\u2019 that Pelosi and Clyburn Get Challenges and Hoyer Doesn\u2019t", "paragraph": "On Saturday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAM Joy,\u201d host Joy Reid said it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-SC) face challenges to their candidacies for House Democratic leadership posts, while House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) doesn\u2019t, and \u201cthe African-American guy and the woman get challengers, and everyone\u2019s saying they\u2019ve got to go in order to save the party\u2019s soul.\u201dMSNBC Contributor and the Root Politics Editor Jason Johnson speculated that the talk about Representative Marcia Fudge (D-OH) challenging Pelosi for the speakership might be Clyburn \u201casking her to step forward and challenge Nancy Pelosi so Pelosi will come and support him. Because he\u2019s got a real challenger. I think there\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes here.\u201dReid asked,\u00a0\u201cI wonder why people don\u2019t look at Steny Hoyer, who\u2019s one year older than Nancy Pelosi, who\u2019s been there as long as she has. They were elected the same year. Why is it Nancy Pelosi that\u2019s the focus, and not someone like Hoyer or Clyburn who\u2019ve both been around a long time too?\u201dTowards the end of the segment, Johnson re-iterated that Clyburn is facing a serious challenge in his leadership race.Reid then wondered why Clyburn is facing a challenge while Hoyer isn\u2019t.Former RNC Chair Michael Steele remarked that Hoyer has \u201cforged relationships\u201d with members of Congress and that\u2019s why he isn\u2019t challenged.Reid then stated, \u201cI just find that interesting, that the African-American guy and the woman get challengers, and everyone\u2019s saying they\u2019ve got to go in order to save the party\u2019s soul.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett\nPoliticsVideoJames ClyburnJoy ReidNancy PelosiSteny Hoyer .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
