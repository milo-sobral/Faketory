{"id": "Watch \u2013 Gorka: \u2018If You Liked the Last Two Years, It Is All on the Ballot in November\u2019", "paragraph": "Gorka said he worked to illustrate the points in his books with personal anecdotes, such as the story of U.S. Navy Captain Eugene \u201cRed\u201d McDaniel, a naval aviator shot down over Vietnam and held prisoner by the Vietcong for six and a half years. His captors, Gorka explained, tortured him to the brink of death, but he endured and is still alive to this day.\u201cThere\u2019s a moment when, after the initial round of torture, he\u2019s got scabs, his arm is out of his socket, and another prisoner is brought in,\u201d Gorka recalled. \u201cAnd he looks at this man, and he says, \u2018I finally realized why I\u2019m here.\u2019 Because he was struggling with what brought him to this place, and he said, \u2018I may have been badly injured and tortured, but I saw my fellow American, and he was worse off than me, and I needed to minister to him.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe finds a deeper sense of Jesus. He understands what the suffering of our Lord was through this experience, never loses faith in God through six and a half years, becomes a kind of quasi-minister to his fellow Americans, holds Bible study in the prison, and then eventually is freed,\u201d Gorka said.\u201cNot only that! It\u2019s an amazing story,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a painting of him in the book where he goes back into service. The American Navy put him back into service, and he gets to command his own ship. It is the American story.\u201dGorka compared the strength of heroes like McDaniel to the modern era of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201crestricted free speech zones at U.S. colleges,\u201d an era where quoting Winston Churchill is supposedly a racist blunder. He contended the stories in his book prove American valor is not a distant relic of the World War 2 generation.He also stressed the importance of the life and writings of Whittaker Chambers, author of the landmark biography Witness, which Gorka hailed as a \u201clife-changer\u201d for all who read it.\u201cWhittaker Chambers grew up in very, very humble, simple circumstances, but very smart and an incredible writer. He joins the Communist underground before World War 2. He sympathizes with the Communist message, he\u2019s an idealist \u2013 so much so that he becomes the courier, he becomes the messenger between the Kremlin and their covert agents in the U.S. government,\u201d Gorka recalled.\u201cDuring the war, after Stalin makes a pact with Hitler \u2013 the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact \u2013 he sees the light and he says, \u2018This is evil, this is wrong, I can no longer subscribe to this,\u2019\u201d Gorka continued. \u201cHe sees good Communists, loyal Communists, being killed, being kidnapped by Stalin and his paranoid purges. He says, \u201cOh, my gosh, am I going to be next?\u2019 So he goes underground with his family, he goes into hiding. He hides all the microfilm documents of the messages he was carrying between the agents of the Soviet Union in America and the Kremlin, he goes into hiding.\u201d\u201cAfter the war, he becomes a real full-blooded patriot, and he says, \u2018We\u2019ve got a whole network of bad guys inside the U.S. government. I need to tell somebody.\u2019 He goes to the FBI. The FBI: not interested. He gets connected to the Truman White House. The Truman White House: not interested. Finally, he gets connected to a guy called Richard Nixon who\u2019s working on Capitol Hill, and Congress is very interested,\u201d he said.This resulted in Chambers giving the first televised testimony against the Communist menace and accusing prominent left-wing elitist Alger Hiss of being a Soviet spy, launching a contest of political will that would echo for decades to come.\u201cIf you were shocked at Kavanaugh, open a book,\u201d Gokra chortled, referring to the recent bitter battle over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cRead Why We Fight. Because Whittaker Chambers was Justice Brett Kavanaugh before Kavanaugh was born. Because the Left unleashes the hounds of hell \u2013 the accuse him of being a homosexual, they accuse him of being an alcoholic. They accuse Whittaker Chambers of being responsible for the death of his own brother.\u201d\u201cAnd what happens? He resists the lies. He stands there as a righteous man, to be proven absolutely correct decades later when the Venona decrypts of Soviet intelligence communications prove that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy,\u201d said Gorka. \u201cThis man never ever gave up. Whittaker Chambers is included in my book Why We Fight because he didn\u2019t wear a uniform, he didn\u2019t carry a gun, but he was as much of a hero as Red McDaniel, as Stephen Decatur, as Chesty Puller, who are all in my book,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is this: the left did not invent these tactics with Justice Kavanaugh. They didn\u2019t invent them with Clarence Thomas, or with Judge Bork. They\u2019ve been doing it for 70 years,\u201d he said.Gorka used the exploits of Stephen Decatur, who became America\u2019s youngest Navy captain after a daring 1804 mission to destroy a frigate that fell into the hands of pirates from Tripoli, to make two important points: \u201cLesson One, our fighting forces are amazing, always have been. And Number Two, we\u2019ve been fighting jihadis for about 200 years.\u201dIn terms of handling threats to American security from open borders, Iranian malevolence, and Chinese ambition, Gorka said the media will never give President Trump the credit for intelligence and determination he saw when he served as Trump\u2019s adviser.\u201cWhen you go back to the speeches he\u2019s given for 30 years on China and what they\u2019re doing \u2013 the left will never, never give credit this administration, and especially the president, for knowing exactly what they are doing, and why they\u2019re doing it, for Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cEvil is real,\u201d Gorka mused. \u201cEvil isn\u2019t the mythology of Hercules. Evil walks the Earth right now, ladies and gentlemen. This is what was denied for eight years under the Obama administration. No, no, no, terrorism, evil things, it\u2019s the product of climate change, global warming \u2013 going back to the theories of social science, it\u2019s social movement theory, it\u2019s grievances. Grievances lead to people being beheaded live on camera! This is the insanity.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s evil,\u201d he maintained. \u201cMan is fallen, and we must fight evil wherever it is \u2013 whether it is the slave markets that exist today, right now, as we are sitting here, there are people being sold into sex slavery. Whether it is the 10,000 children that were sent into the hands of the coyotes to be smuggled into America \u2013 what kind of parent does that? Seriously, 10,000 children into the hands of the coyotes, that\u2019s evil. There is no excuse for that. And what must we do? We must stand up to it. Otherwise, evil wins.\u201dGorka spoke forcefully against the media narrative on the disappearance of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u201cLet\u2019s first be accurate: the guy is not a journalist, and he\u2019s not an American, okay?\u201d Gorka said of Khashoggi. \u201cHe\u2019s a foreign national killed in a foreign country who wasn\u2019t a journalist. He was an opinion piece commentator for the left, Number One.\u201d\u201cNumber Two, the amount of column inches and time dedicated to this story of a foreigner killed in a foreign land \u2013 could we compare that to the left\u2019s coverage of Benghazi, where Americans are being killed in a foreign land?\u201d he continued. Gorka said there is a \u201cdeeper story\u201d behind the use of the Khashoggi story to bash President Trump\u2019s policy in the Middle East, especially by supporters of President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal.\u201cThese are the guys who are trying to defend giving $140 billion to Iran. Now they suddenly have pangs of conscience?\u201d he scoffed.\u201cLook, this guy is dead. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s dead. He may have been tortured. But the quality of the reporting \u2013 \u2018a Turkish official heard from somebody who heard from somebody who may have heard the audio cassette\u2019 Come on, guys, this is ridiculous,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what this is all about,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cLet\u2019s pray for his soul, for his family. This is about one thing: the president has finally stood up to the media, which has been pumping a tissue of lies for decades, and he\u2019s calling parts of it \u2013 let\u2019s be accurate here, they misquote him \u2013 he\u2019s calling parts of the mainstream media \u2018fake news.\u2019 Now they think they\u2019ve got him, and they can connect his righteous indignation at the lies with the death of this quote-unquote \u2018journalist\u2019 who is not a journalist. That\u2019s what this is all about. They couldn\u2019t care less. If this guy was not a journalist, they couldn\u2019t care less about this man\u2019s plight. This is about attacking Donald J. Trump, nothing more, nothing less.\u201dWhen a caller questioned the relevance of the Khashoggi case to American policy, Gorka reflected that avoiding foreign entanglements is easier said than done.\u201cIf only the world were that simple. Isolationism didn\u2019t work on Pearl Harbor in \u201841, it didn\u2019t work on 9/11,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t make an internal matter the primary thing in a bilateral relationship with another country, but we can\u2019t have people who say they\u2019re our friends putting out hit jobs on people they politically disagree with. There has got to be some consequence. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an earth-shattering strategic consequence for our national security, but if you say you\u2019re our friend, you shouldn\u2019t be behaving like this, and there have got to be some consequences,\u201d he said.Gorka added the observation that if news reports of a 15-man team dispatched from Saudi Arabia to abduct or kill Khashoggi are correct, it could not have been a \u201crogue operation\u201d by some over-enthusiastic courtier who overheard the royals grumble about Khashoggi\u2019s criticism one day and decided to silence him.\u201c15 guys on diplomatic passports on a private jet? That\u2019s not a rogue unit. Somebody very high up in the Saudi administration okayed this. Is it the crown prince? I\u2019ll tell you who\u2019s going to find out. It\u2019s a friend of mine: Mike Pompeo,\u201d he said.Another important topic on the public mind is immigration, which Gorka thought has not received the attention it deserved in the last few weeks before the midterm election because other issues have crowded it from the news.\u201cI will tell you one thing because I know it, because I\u2019ve worked for the man, during the campaign, in the White House: He will never, ever go south on you. He will never betray the American people on the wall,\u201d he said of President Trump\u2019s position on illegal immigration.\u201cHe is a very, very kindhearted man,\u201d Gorka added. There is a reason he invited the survivors of the Parkland shooting to the White House. He didn\u2019t have to do that. It\u2019s because he cares. He wanted to make a deal on DACA \u2013 not something I would have subscribed to, but he does that not because he\u2019s jockeying for political position, but because he is compassionate.\u201d\u201cI will guarantee for you: he will never, ever go soft on us on the wall,\u201d he stressed.Gorka said his own preferred solution begins with acknowledging that \u201cwe don\u2019t punish children for the sins of their parents.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re never getting to be an America. You get to the end of the line, and we\u2019ll let you apply for a green card if you arrived here under the age of 18 as a DACA person. But that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t get to jump the line. You don\u2019t get citizenship. Why should you? You can live here if you pay taxes and you\u2019re legal, but you get to the back of the line. It\u2019s that simple.\u201dGorka said Republican voters should not take the midterm elections for granted.\u201cDon\u2019t just vote yourself,\u201d he advised. \u201cGet people out there you know who will not vote otherwise, because it\u2019s raining. And please, for the next 19 days, get on social media. I don\u2019t care how old you are, how much of a Luddite and klutz you are technologically, get a social media account on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and support the president, and make sure that we keep the House. Because if you liked the last two years, if you like your 401(k), if you like ISIS being destroyed, being crushed, it is all on the ballot in November.\u201d\nNational SecurityVideo2018 electionscold warDACADr. Sebastian GorkaimmigrationJamal KhashoggiSaudi ArabiaVietnam .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
