Supervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following the recounts.\u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 12, 2018Snipes has come under fire for questionable vote counting practices as the margin between leading Republican gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidates and their Democrat opponents has narrowed to the point of automatic recount territory.Election fraud expert Eric Eggers of the Government Accountability Institute pointed to Snipes\u2019 failure to follow Florida election law and the 2017 admission that her office allowed non-U.S. citizens and felons to vote. Broward County Commissioner Ilene Lieberman complained in 2012 that Snipes was known to \u201cfind\u201d more ballots in the course of close election counts. Eggers listed several other improper actions by Snipes.While governor of Florida, Bush appointed Snipes as Broward County Supervisor of elections in 2003 to replace Miriam Oliphant, whom he had removed on reports of \u201cneglect of duty, incompetence and misfeasance,\u201d according to WFTV and CNN.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News \u2014 follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook\nMidterm ElectionPoliticsBrenda SnipesBroward CountyEric EggersFloridaGovernment Accountability InstitutJeb Bushmidterm electionMiriam Oliphant .Copyright \u00a9 2018 Breitbart"}
