He's due to make $855,529 per week under the franchise tag for the rest of this season as soon as he ends his holdout and signs the contract.The Rooney family, which owns the Steelers, was valued at $1.2 billion by Forbes in 2015 before dropping off the list of America's richest families the following year.
