{"id": "Michigan State WR Felton Davis III Suffers Torn Achilles Injury vs. MichiganRelated", "paragraph": "Michigan State senior wide receiver Felton Davis III suffered a torn Achilles during Saturday's game against Michigan.Chris Vannini of The Athletic noted that Fox confirmed the nature of the injury during its broadcast of the game.The injury occurred late in the second quarter with the Spartans trailing the Wolverines 7-0.Davis fell to the ground at the snap after going in motion. The field was slick due to a lightning storm that caused a delay.The experienced wideout entered the game with a questionable designation, as he was nursing a hip injury, per the\u00a0Detroit Free Press.Davis was Michigan State's leading receiver this season with 31 receptions for 474 yards and four touchdowns prior to Saturday's contest.He also led the team in 2017 with 55 grabs for 776 yards and nine scores.Several other Michigan State wide receivers were on the injury report for Saturday's game, including Cody White (left hand),\u00a0Darrell Stewart Jr. (left ankle), Jalen Nailor (undisclosed), Laress Nelson (leg), Cam Chambers (thumb) and Brandon Sowards (lower body).Stewart, Chambers and Sowards have seen action against the Wolverines.With Davis presumably out for the remainder of the season, the Spartans will be forced to move forward with a makeshift receiving corps in the coming weeks."}
