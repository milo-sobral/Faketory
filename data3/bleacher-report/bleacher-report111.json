Anderson\u00a0saved them and held after he took advantage of a rare Djokovic mistake, but there was already an inevitability about where the match was going.Anderson was forced to go for the lines with every shot, and he eventually dropped another service game to go 5-2 behind.Djokovic made no mistake in serving out the set, and he got another early advantage in the second as he broke Anderson for 1-0.\u00a0That effectively ended the game as a contest, as Djokovic's serving was so solid he never looked like he'd be broken.In the entire match, he lost only seven points on serve, while he won 74 per cent of points when Anderson missed his first serve.The world No. 6 has enjoyed an impressive year, and he showed admirable grit not to crumble after he went behind again in the second set.\u00a0He also creditably made Djokovic serve out the set after he came under pressure again when 5-1 behind.In truth, though, the gulf in class was huge, and Zverev will need to hope Djokovic has an off day on Sunday if he is to have any chance of claiming the title.\u00a0"}
