On both occasions they allowed their hosts back into it. Lloris, the hero at West Ham, is the villain a few days later.Toby Alderweireld blundered away to hand Hirving Lozano the opener, and Hugo Lloris followed suit in the second half getting sent off for a foul on the Mexican. Lucas Moura and Harry Kane had given their team the lead by that point, but Luuk de Jong bagged a late equaliser."}
