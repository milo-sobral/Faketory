{"id": "Report: Vontaze Burfict Fined $112K for Antonio Brown Hit, More vs. SteelersRelated", "paragraph": "Cincinnati Bengals linebacker\u00a0Vontaze Burfict has been fined $112,000 for unnecessary roughness on multiple plays during a clash against the Pittsburgh Steelers in\u00a0Week 6, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.The plays in question involved hits on receiver Antonio Brown and running back James Conner.Burfict, of course, has a\u00a0long track record\u00a0of questionable actions on the football field. He has been fined and suspended on multiple occasions throughout his seven-year career, as NFL Network's Marc\u00a0Sessler\u00a0pointed out earlier this year:Along with multiple suspensions, Burfict has been forced to pay thousands out of pocket for a flurry of hits on defenseless players, flipping the middle finger to fans, ankle twisting, spearing &amp; striking a player in groin. A real gem! https://t.co/xmdH4rOFgmPro Football Talk's\u00a0Charean\u00a0Williams\u00a0noted the troubled linebacker has lost more than $4 million in his career as a result.Last week's game against Pittsburgh was just\u00a0Burfict's second appearance of the season. He was\u00a0suspended\u00a0for the first four games of the regular season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances.Cincinnati and Pittsburgh have been involved in a physical rivalry through the years, with\u00a0Burfict\u00a0typically right in the middle of things. Week 6 marked the first time the two teams met on the field since Steelers receiver\u00a0JuJu\u00a0Smith-Schuster\u00a0concussed\u00a0Burfict\u00a0with a\u00a0crackback\u00a0block last year. Smith-Schuster\u00a0received a one-game suspension.It was a fairly tame game, by their standards at least. However,\u00a0Burfict\u00a0once again found himself at the center of controversy following some questionable hits.Smith-Schuster told reporters after the Steelers' 28-21 victory that the Bengals defense made \"major threats\" in his direction, per\u00a0DKPittsburghSports.com's\u00a0Dejan\u00a0Kovacevic:Priceless JuJu on how the Bengals treated him on the field: #DKPS #Steelers https://t.co/T02zxQc9XPPittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger also accused\u00a0Burfict\u00a0of threatening Smith-Schuster.\"He hits AB, then, literally, as I am under center for the next play, he points at\u00a0JuJu\u00a0and says, 'You're next,'\" Roethlisberger said, according to the\u00a0Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's\u00a0Ron Cook. \"How do you allow that stuff?\"NFL Network's\u00a0Mike\u00a0Garafolo\u00a0posted video footage of the alleged incident, but it's unclear what the Bengals linebacker was saying, as there is no audio.Despite a number of plays being subject to review by the NFL,\u00a0Burfict\u00a0managed to escape a suspension but will see his bank account take a hit. He will be available to play in Sunday night's showdown against the 5-1 Kansas City Chiefs.The Bengals and Steelers don't meet again until the regular-season finale on Dec. 30 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. If the game holds playoff implications, the league will likely once again be on high alert."}
