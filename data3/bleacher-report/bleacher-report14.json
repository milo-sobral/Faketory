{"id": "Fantasy Football Week 7 Rankings: Updated Positional Breakdown for Flex and PPRRelated", "paragraph": "NFL fans have the option to sit on the couch and watch football largely uninterrupted for 14 hours or so on Sunday as the Tennessee Titans and Los Angeles Chargers kick off at Wembley Stadium in London, England, at 9:30 a.m. ET.The usual dose of games starting between 1 p.m. and 4:25 p.m. will take place, with the Cincinnati Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs playing in the nightcap at 8:20 p.m.Here's a look ahead at some Week 7 fantasy football rankings for the three eligible flex positions (running back, wide receiver and tight end). The projections are based on point-per-reception scoring.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Top 15 Running Backs1.

That turns the Browns backfield into a two-man partnership between Nick Chubb and Duke Johnson Jr.Presumably, Chubb will be the man on early downs, while Johnson should be the primary back for third downs and/or passing situations. However, the Dawgs By Nature blog posits that Johnson could get the most work Sunday:If I were a betting man, I would wager that Duke gets the majority of the work on Sunday. Especially with the possibility of a pass heavy game.Johnson may blow up against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense, and a few facts point to that happening.First, the Bucs rank last in passing yards allowed per attempt. Ex-Miami star Johnson is an adept pass-catcher who led Cleveland with 74 receptions last year.Second, this game could develop into a shootout: Per OddsShark, the current over/under total is 51.5 points, which is the fourth-highest mark on the Week 7 slate.Third, only two NFL teams have allowed more receiving yards to running backs than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this year, per Football Outsiders.Finally, Johnson has been receiving increased snaps of late, to the point where he was on the field more than the workhorse Hyde last Sunday (47 percent of snaps to 43 percent). Now Hyde is in Jacksonville, opening up more opportunities for Johnson.All of these facts could lead to a productive outing for Johnson, especially in point-per-reception leagues.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Top 25 Wide Receivers1.

His catch rate of 69.8 percent is also a career-best mark (Hopkins had never topped 60 percent before this year).The ex-Clemson star is simply matchup-proof. He just faced a defense that has allowed only 50 points through its past four-and-a-half games and still came away with five receptions and a touchdown.Now he goes against a Jacksonville Jaguars defense that was excellent last season (No. 1 in points allowed per game) but has showed some cracks this year. The Jags have been outscored 70-21 in their past two games and most recently lost 40-7 to the Dallas Cowboys.Hopkins may have problems with the outside corner tandem of A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey, but they're both going to have issues guarding him. He posted 11 receptions for 135 yards and one touchdown in two games against the Texans last year, and current starting quarterback Deshaun Watson was on the field for only two of those eight quarters.Watson is good to go for Sunday, so look for the connection between him and Hopkins to be productive.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Top 10 Tight Ends1.

Not only does that make Ertz the leading tight end in targets league-wide, but he's also No. 6 in targets overall.Of note, Ertz's production has been consistent all year. It's not as if he had 20-plus targets in one game, as he's seen between nine and 14 passes thrown his way for all six of his matchups. A five-catch, 48-yard effort in Week 1 was his worst outing: Since then, he's caught a touchdown pass or amassed 73 or more receiving yards in each game.\u00a0Ertz also has a 71.6 percent catch rate, which is his second-best career mark.Ertz is also matchup-agnostic: In a game against the Tennessee Titans, the ex-Stanford star caught 10 passes for 112 yards on 14 targets. The Titans are ranked third in fewest points allowed per game and are ranked ninth in yards per game allowed to tight ends, per\u00a0Football Outsiders.Ertz has a tougher matchup against a Carolina Panthers defense that features a few stars (namely linebacker Luke Kuechly, who Ertz could see in coverage). However, the volume of targets Ertz will see negates matchup concerns, and he should have another solid afternoon."}
