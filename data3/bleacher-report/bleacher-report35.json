{"id": "Eric Weddle on Cam Newton Being a Unique QB: 'He's a Fast Dinosaur'Related", "paragraph": "If the producers of future\u00a0Jurassic World\u00a0movies want to study how dinosaurs run, they can study Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton.\u00a0\u00a0Per ESPN.com's Jamison Hensley, Baltimore Ravens safety Eric Weddle had a unique description of Newton leading up to their Week 8 matchup on Sunday.\u00a0\"He's a fast dinosaur, muscular and big and runs people over,\" Weddle\u00a0said. \"He's a very unique quarterback in this league. He's the only one really like him.\"The\u00a0University of Manchester\u00a0published a study in the\u00a0PeerJ\u00a0journal last year that the\u00a0Tyrannosaurus rex's top speed was around 12 mph.\u00a0Since Newton has been clocked with a top speed of 20.08 mph, he is, in fact, faster than a T. Rex. The 2015 NFL MVP is also listed at 6'5\" and 245 pounds, giving him the build of a linebacker and ability to run over defenders.\u00a0So if anyone assumes Weddle was trying to make a joke, the science proves it's an accurate description for Newton's ability on the football field.\u00a0"}
