{"id": "Arsenal Transfer News: Gunners Reportedly Want Loan Deal for MalcomRelated", "paragraph": "Arsenal reportedly want to take struggling Barcelona winger Malcom on loan during the January transfer window.The Gunners are identified as the most interested in Malcom, who is also wanted by Serie A side Inter Milan and Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, per Lluis Miguelsanz of\u00a0Sport (h/t the Daily Star's\u00a0Callum Vurley).Miguelsanz\u00a0(h/t\u00a0Duncan Wright\u00a0of\u00a0The Sun) has revealed how Spurs and the Gunners have already sounded out\u00a0Barca\u00a0about striking a temporary deal this winter.Landing\u00a0Malcom\u00a0would be a coup for Arsenal head coach\u00a0Unai\u00a0Emery, especially since the club has been linked with the 21-year-old Brazilian in the past. Back in January of this year,\u00a0Malcom\u00a0was\u00a0touted\u00a0as a potential replacement for Alexis Sanchez, after Tottenham withdrew interest in a player valued at \u00a345 million by Bordeaux.Arsenal have asked info to Bordeaux for the Brazilian winger #Malcom, 1997. He can be a good opportunity for January or for next season. There are many clubs on him: not easy. \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 #transfers #AFC #ArsenalSanchez eventually moved to Arsenal's Premier League rivals Manchester United, with\u00a0Henrikh\u00a0Mkhitaryan\u00a0going the other way. Meanwhile,\u00a0Malcom\u00a0had to wait until the summer to swap\u00a0Ligue\u00a01 for the Camp\u00a0Nou.Things haven't gone well since his \u00a336.5 million move to\u00a0Barca. Playing time has been hard to come by as\u00a0Malcom\u00a0has made just two appearances off the bench in La Liga, while he's also yet to make an appearance for his new club in the\u00a0UEFA\u00a0Champions League.The lack of minutes is wasting\u00a0Malcom's core talents, namely pace, trickery and vision. Those qualities would easily find a home in an Arsenal squad lacking true width in attacking areas.Emery's team doesn't have a natural winger, a deficiency which has forced the manager to play centre-forward Pierre-Emerick\u00a0Aubameyang\u00a0out wide. Danny\u00a0Welbeck\u00a0can play on the flanks, but like\u00a0Aubameyang, he is also best suited through the middle.Similarly,\u00a0Mkhitaryan,\u00a0Mesut\u00a0Ozil\u00a0and Alex\u00a0Iwobi\u00a0have all been deployed wide. Yet every member of this trio is more effective when playing centrally as a No. 10.Securing\u00a0Malcom\u00a0would lend Emery greater tactical flexibility for his preferred 4-2-3-1 formation.Arsenal's plans for January could be undone by an injury suffered by Lionel\u00a0Messi\u00a0during\u00a0Barca's 4-2 win over\u00a0Sevilla\u00a0in La Liga on Saturday:Lionel Messi is forced off with an apparent arm injury.\n\nNot what Barcelona fans want to see ahead of Wednesday's clash with Inter and the upcoming Cl\u00e1sico ... https://t.co/Xm9WUUN0VdWhile the full extent of the problem is not yet known,\u00a0Messi's absence will increase the need for attacking depth in Ernesto Valverde's squad.\u00a0Malcom\u00a0can provide it in support of Luis Suarez and\u00a0Ousmane\u00a0Dembele.However, if\u00a0Malcom\u00a0still finds himself overlooked while\u00a0Messi\u00a0is on the treatment table, it will only strengthen the resolve of interested clubs to push for a deal when the winter window opens."}
