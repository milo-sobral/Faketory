{"id": "MLB Rumors: Giants Interested in Farhan Zaidi for President of Baseball Ops.Related", "paragraph": "The San Francisco Giants have reportedly expanded their search for a president of baseball operations to their archrivals.According to Jon Morosi of MLB Network, San Francisco is \"interested\" in Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi for the role. While Morosi cautioned it is \"unclear if the scenario is viable,\" he noted the interest could be the reason San Francisco's search has been somewhat slow.This comes after\u00a0Bruce Levine\u00a0of 670 The Score reported the Giants interviewed Chicago Cubs senior vice president Jason McLeod.\"We needed to take a fresh approach with baseball operations,\" Giants CEO Larry\u00a0Baer\u00a0said in September after San Francisco fired general manager Bobby Evans, according to\u00a0Mark Gonzales\u00a0of the\u00a0Chicago Tribune. \"We've had a very successful group here a long time, but we have to bring a new approach to Giants baseball and take a look outside.\"As for\u00a0Zaidi, the Dodgers\u00a0named\u00a0him general manager in November 2014 after he was with the Oakland Athletics for 10 years in positions such as the assistant general manager and director of baseball operations.Los Angeles won the National League West all four years under his direction and reached the 2016 National League Championship Series and past two World Series before losing to the eventual champions each time.The Giants have not enjoyed that level of success since they won the World Series in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The 2012 campaign was the last time they won the division, and they finished in last place in the NL West in 2017 and fourth this past season."}
