Members of both teams exchanged words without going much beyond that.In response to the Spartans' tactic, Bush repeatedly dragged his foot across Michigan State's logo at midfield.Players getting into it and the Spartan logo getting defaced?\n\nYup, it's time for @UMichFootball vs. @MSU_Football. https://t.co/iquUXIBRf8Speaking to reporters on Monday, Harbaugh likened the scene to something out of\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0and criticized Dantonio for\u2014in Harbaugh's eyes\u2014doing nothing to stop the incident from happening, per\u00a0the\u00a0Detroit News'\u00a0Angelique S. Chengelis:\"I see where they're using the word juvenile. I think that's trying to brush it under the carpet because their strength coaches were out there leading it. Their assistant coaches were out there. Coach Dantonio was right behind it. That had all the ear-markings and evidence of an orchestrated stormtrooper march.\"Dantonio\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Tuesday he wasn't going to provide further comment regarding the situation and was looking ahead to Michigan State's game against the Purdue Boilermakers on Saturday.The Wolverines defeated their in-state rivals 21-7, a score that didn't tell the full story of the game. Michigan held Michigan State to 94 yards of total offense, the Spartans'\u00a0fewest\u00a0since 1947."}
