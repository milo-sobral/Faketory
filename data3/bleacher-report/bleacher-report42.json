{"id": "Report: Manchester United 'Favourites' to Capture Jadon Sancho from DortmundRelated", "paragraph": "Manchester United have reportedly emerged as \"favourites\" to sign Borussia Dortmund starlet\u00a0Jadon Sancho if the player returns to England.According to the\u00a0Mirror\u00a0(h/t\u00a0Ryan Taylor\u00a0of the\u00a0Daily Express), the Red Devils lead the pack to bring the winger to the Premier League.Sancho departed Manchester City's youth team to join BVB in the Bundesliga in 2017, and the attacker's form has since been astounding as he takes German football by storm.The\u00a0Guardian\u00a0(h/t Taylor) reported United are ready to provide manager Jose\u00a0Mourinho\u00a0with significant funds, with defensive and attacking targets being considered.\u00a0Mourinho\u00a0will be allowed to spend \u00a3100 million in the January transfer window, with Sancho on the coach's radar.In the current market, the England international could be worth more than \u00a3100 million, but City have a buy-back option in place if they want to activate a deal, per Taylor.United have struggled to find the net this term, and\u00a0Mourinho\u00a0recently dropped\u00a0Romelu\u00a0Lukaku\u00a0as he attempted to revitalise his forward line and shuffle the pack against\u00a0Everton\u00a0in the Premier League.The Red Devils lack a creative talent resembling Sancho's likeness, and he would immediately fit alongside Anthony Martial and Marcus\u00a0Rashford\u00a0in a youthful trio.Lukaku\u00a0is likely to win back the No. 9 role in due course, but\u00a0Mourinho\u00a0has been desperate to add a winger to his selection for two years.United previously\u00a0chased\u00a0Inter Milan winger Ivan\u00a0Perisic\u00a0in the hope of adding width, with\u00a0Mourinho's team far too narrow and predictable.However, despite the reported interest,\u00a0BVB\u00a0are confident Sancho will not be heading to Old\u00a0Trafford\u00a0in the near future.According to\u00a0Bild\u00a0(h/t\u00a0FourFourTwo), Dortmund\u00a0sporting director Michael\u00a0Zorc\u00a0has said he believes Sancho will stay in Germany for now.Zorc\u00a0said: \"I'm pretty sure\u00a0Jadon\u00a0will be playing with us for some time.\"The player recently revealed his joy after signing a fresh deal to stay at the\u00a0Signal\u00a0Iduna\u00a0Park until 2022.Per\u00a0FourFourTwo, Sancho said:\u00a0\"You can see that right now, I play a lot here. This is important for young players to develop.\u00a0You never know what will happen in the future, but I'm really happy right now.\"Sancho is likely to become the subject of further speculation\u00a0as the transfer window approaches, and the biggest clubs in the world will be watching his progress with serious interest.United would have to break the bank to sign the winger in January, and a centre-back should be the club's priority as they attempt to rescue their season."}
