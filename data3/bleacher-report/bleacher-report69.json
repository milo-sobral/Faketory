I\u2019ll never forget my experience at Liverpool.\"Premier League football is different, I would call it special: I would like to play for Liverpool again some day. I grew up there and it is a big club.\"If the Reds come back in for him, he might be tempted to jump ship in order to realise that ambition.The Spaniard may well be similarly tempted by Real or Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea, though, so tying him down should be a priority for the\u00a0Rossoneri."}
