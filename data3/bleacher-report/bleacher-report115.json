He's averaged 17.2 touches over his five games this season, with a high of 27 against the Oakland Raiders. Mack is also a key player after the Colts cross the opponent's 20-yard line, as he's averaged 3.2 red-zone rushes per game. Despite missing four games, Mack is also tied for 12th in the league with six red-zone rushes inside the five-yard line.The concern for Mack's Week 11 fantasy performance is whether the Titans jump out to a sizable lead, which could force the Colts to move more to the pass. If that's the case, then running back Nyheim Hines may take some of Mack's looks. Hines has 37 catches (average of 4.3 receptions per game) for 206 yards this year, while Mack averages just 1.6 receptions per contest.Still, the Colts are 1.5-point home favorites, per OddsShark, and winners of three straight games. Chances are Indianapolis won't play catch-up all game, which would increase Mack's odds of being the team's primary back for four quarters.Mack is also one of the more efficient ball-carriers in the league. In addition to his 5.3 yards per carry,\u00a0the second-year pro is third in DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) among all running backs with at least 50 carries, per\u00a0Football Outsiders.That could prove beneficial against a Titans run defense that ranks in the bottom 10 in adjusted line yards, according to Football Outsiders.Mack may have just rushed for only 29 yards on 12 carries against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, but the pluses outweigh the minuses here. Start him in season-long leagues with confidence.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pittsburgh Steelers TE Vance McDonald (at Jacksonville Jaguars)One of the NFL's more efficient tight ends, Vance McDonald of the Pittsburgh Steelers has caught 30 of his 38 targets (78.9 percent) for 390 yards and two touchdowns. Not only does that place him fifth among all qualified tight ends, per Pro Football Reference, but McDonald is also eighth in his position group in yards per reception (13.0).While a matchup with the Jaguars (top 10 in points allowed per game as well as\u00a0DVOA) may look tough at first glance, McDonald may have a matchup advantage.Evan Silva of Rotoworld wrote about the Jags' vulnerability to tight ends in his Week 11 matchups column:\"In Weeks 4-10, tight ends caught 26-of-38 targets (68%) for 362 yards (9.53 YPA) and six touchdowns against Jacksonville.\u00a0Eric Ebron\u00a0and\u00a0Mo Alie-Cox\u00a0dropped four TDs on them just last week. Targeted a career-high 16 times in January's playoff loss, McDonald is an upside TE1 play in this rematch. Jaguars SS\u00a0Barry Church\u00a0has stood out as an especially big liability in coverage.\"Those six touchdowns Silva mentioned have all come in the past two weeks. Whether that's a product of a serious schematic issue of late or just coincidence is up for debate, but the numbers are still alarming enough to think that McDonald can reap the benefits of facing a Jags defense with recent struggles versus his position.McDonald also caught 10 passes for 112 yards in the 2017 AFC Divisional Round versus the Jags.\u00a0While those numbers will be tough to match on Sunday, McDonald could be the X-factor for a Pittsburgh victory. He's a clear must-start at tight end unless you have a better option, such as Zach Ertz of the Philadelphia Eagles."}
