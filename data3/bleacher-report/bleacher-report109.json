The German won the point after it was replayed, and the largely pro-Federer crowd made their feelings known.Per\u00a0BBC Sport,\u00a0Zverev explained his disappointment at the crowd's reaction:\"I was really upset afterwards in the locker room, I'm not going to lie. I had to take a few minutes for myself.\"But, you know, I hope the crowd and the people who were booing maybe look at what actually happened, maybe just realise that I've maybe not done anything wrong.\"Zverev now meets Djokovic, who was in dominant form in his last-four match with Anderson.The Serb appeared untouchable as he dealt with everything the South African could muster, and he will be full of confidence ahead of the final.Djokovic claimed the opening set at pace, breaking Anderson's serve in the opening game before a\u00a0second break made it 5-2 to the world No. 1. He served out the set and continued to move through the gears in the second, with Anderson totally outclassed in a one-sided affair.\u00a0The performance has Djokovic looking good for a sixth\u00a0ATP\u00a0World Tour Finals title.Journalist and tennis commentator, Jose Morgado, gave a simple assessment:Absurd level from Djokovic.The final is set to take place at 6 p.m. GMT/ 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.\u00a0Djokovic defeated\u00a0Zverev 6-4, 6-1 in the round-robin stage earlier in the tournament."}
