According to ESPN, Molina has spent much of this year providing aid to his native Puerto Rico after the devastation from Hurricane Maria in 2017.\"I feel very honored, very proud to receive the Roberto Clemente Award,\" Molina told ESPN's Marly Rivera.Molina spent two weeks in Puerto Rico last October while\u00a0delivering food and water,\u00a0This makes the award especially meaningful considering both Molina and Clemente are from Puerto Rico, with the former Pittsburgh Pirates star also known for his humanitarian work. Molina discussed what Clemente meant to him this week, per\u00a0Derrick Goold\u00a0of the\u00a0St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\"When I was growing up he was like a legend for us, like a hero, and he was everywhere. He was one of my heroes back in the day\u2014still one of my heroes\u2014and just to have this award means a lot to me and to my family. I\u2019m happy for that. It\u2019s great. For the people of Puerto Rico, we\u2019ve been through many (challenges). We didn\u2019t do it thinking of this award. But just to receive this award and makes us proud, makes us proud, after all we did down there in Puerto Rico.\u00a0It\u2019s just a good feeling to add this award.\"He is the fourth Puerto Rican native to win the award and the fifth Cardinals player, the most of any organization.Molina was also solid on the field once again in 2018, hitting 20 home runs this season, which was the second most of his career. He also posted a .261 batting average on his way to his ninth All-Star selection.The catcher has already accomplished quite a bit in the majors, but this honor might be his most meaningful."}
