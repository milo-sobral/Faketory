We Want a Championship'Related", "paragraph": "Jimmy Butler has high expectations for the Philadelphia 76ers following his trade Monday from the Minnesota Timberwolves.\"We want to win. We want a championship,\" the guard said of his new team, per John Clark of NBC Sports Philadelphia. \"With the core group of guys we have, we'll figure out a way to get it done.\"The 76ers entered Monday tied for third in the Eastern Conference with an 8-6 record, but the addition of a four-time All-Star to an already talented lineup has raised the expectations even higher.According to OddsShark, the team's odds of winning the NBA title shifted from 22-1 to 14-1 after the trade. Philadelphia was considered the sixth-most likely squad to take home the championship, but now only the Golden State Warriors (2-3), Toronto Raptors (17-2) and Boston Celtics (19-2) have better odds. The Houston Rockets are also 14-1.Ben Simmons on Saturday talked about the benefits of the trade, including Butler's mentality.\"Between me, [Joel Embiid] and Jimmy, we all have that similar mindset of we hate losing, that pisses us off, and we want to win,\" Simmons said, per NBA.com. \"A guy like him who can come in, score the ball, veteran leadership, experience\u2014he's going to fit in here.\"Butler is in a much better situation considering Minnesota's rough start. The guard put in a trade request in late September, and while the front office waited to deal him, the Timberwolves were just 4-9 to begin the season and have been outscored by 7.2 points per game.The 29-year-old is clearly excited about another fresh start."}
