{"id": "NATO Dusts Off a Cold War Skill: Moving Troops ", "paragraph": "November 17, 2018BRUSSELS\u2014U.S. Admiral James Foggo has spent months planning for NATO\u2019s largest exercise since the Cold War. His first target: getting all 50,000 troops in place by the time drills start on Thursday.

Ten thousand vehicles, 250 aircraft and 65 ships were dispatched, with most of the mat\u00e9rial directed to southern Norway. WSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMore"}
