{"id": "The Wall Street JournalMagazineSwiss Architecture Firm Herzog & De Meuron Celebrates 40 Years ", "paragraph": "November 15, 2018https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-architecture-firm-herzog-de-meuron-celebrates-40-years-1541342966 KLEINBASEL IS A LITTLE wedge of Basel, Switzerland, stranded in Germany, just across the Rhine from the city proper. Today the district is a hub for both commerce and culture\u2014most famously as the home of Art Basel, the annual fair that turns the city into the capital of the global art world every June. But in the 1950s, Kleinbasel was a sleepy place, a working- and middle-class redoubt bounded to the north by woods and vineyards and to the south by the river, warm enough in summer to swim in despite the rushing current.This is where Pierre de Meuron met Jacques Herzog. \u201cWe grew up 200 yards from each other,\u201d recalls de Meuron, now 68. The pair first became acquainted when they were preschool age. Though they were from differing backgrounds\u2014de Meuron\u2019s family was Francophone, Herzog\u2019s German-speaking\u2014such distinctions meant little in polyglot Basel. And what they had in common was more compelling. \u201cOur interest was always in doing something with our hands, understanding how things worked,\u201d says de Meuron. They harbored a special enthusiasm, he adds, for \u201croller coasters and ships.\u201dThe two men haven\u2019t gotten terribly far from the playrooms and schoolyards of their youth. Today their studio is a scant five-minute walk from the old neighborhood, and they spend much of their time at the office tinkering with models and dreaming up gee-whiz notions. But the pair now have a firm of 390 employees playing alongside them, with another 62 scattered across five satellite branches around the world. And they\u2019re no longer dealing in idle fancies but creating some of the most challenging and startling architecture to be found anywhere.Now celebrating its 40th-anniversary year, the firm of Herzog & de Meuron (H&dM) enjoys a reach extending from Kleinbasel, where it designed the 2013 Messe building, in which Art Basel is now held, to Hong Kong, where its upcoming M+ museum will be a cultural landmark in a city better known for high-rises. After six decades of mind-melding friendship, the founders have succeeded in forging a shared sensibility and then diffusing it through their immense body of work, without ever seeming to dilute the formula. \u201cWe have never stopped being involved in every project, starting each project,\u201d says Herzog, also 68. It\u2019s a level of commitment that helps give the firm\u2019s projects their ineffable presence. Other than that, it can be difficult at times to say what does tie together the firm\u2019s diverse portfolio. Lower Manhattan\u2019s looming 56 Leonard apartment building, familiar to locals as the \u201cJenga\u201d tower; the sublime void of the turbine hall at London\u2019s Tate Modern; San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum, resembling a rusty dinosaur grazing in Golden Gate Park: H&dM has been all over the map in every sense, taking a different formal tack with every banner commission. Fashion designer and arts patron Miuccia Prada,  who has collaborated with the architects many times, says she is \u201calways attracted by the beauty of their work\u201d\u2014though the sheer range of projects they\u2019ve done together, from an eye-popping retail location in Tokyo to an austere runway design for last spring\u2019s 2019 cruise show in New York, demonstrates just how flexible H&dM\u2019s sense of beauty can be. As difficult as it is to fix an aesthetic label to the firm, its conceptual MO is even harder to describe, and talking to the founders doesn\u2019t necessarily clarify anything. \u201cYou can ask me how I see it,\u201d de Meuron hedges. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I know exactly what it is.\u201d His colleague is even less forthcoming. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do any self-interpretation,\u201d says Herzog.For critics and fans who have followed the designers\u2019 ascent\u2014starting with their first projects around Basel that earned them a cult following, through their 2001 Pritzker Prize win, to the enthusiastic reception of their glittering Elbphilharmonie concert hall complex, which opened in Hamburg, Germany, last year\u2014the relative taciturnity of the partners can be convenient, allowing for various explanations to be projected onto them. For curator and architect Terence Riley, who commissioned the firm to design the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami when he was its director, the key is culture: \u201cJacques and Pierre have this very Swiss thing,\u201d he says, pointing to their sense of \u201corderliness\u201d combined with their \u201camazingly innovative ideas.\u201d For photographer and collaborator Thomas Ruff, who helped create murals for H&dM\u2019s 1999 library at Germany\u2019s Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, it\u2019s all about the partners\u2019 artistic predilections. In working with them, Ruff says, he has found that they \u201creally feel like artists themselves, and that\u2019s why they have this outlook and this great interest in contemporary art as well as architecture.\u201d Others might point to the importance of collaboration or materials or history or any one of a dozen-odd elements and attributes that mark H&dM\u2019s unique practice. Theories abound, and the designers seem to revel in the confusion. What really defines the practice is a combination of all these things\u2014including, and perhaps especially, the obfuscation. The playwright Tom Stoppard once said that a good piece of theater should be \u201ca series of ambushes,\u201d emotional and intellectual sneak attacks launched against the audience. Herzog & de Meuron buildings often seem to deploy a similar stratagem. Does the firm\u2019s Dominus Valley winery in Yountville, California, look like a flat black block? Go inside and you\u2019ll see the skin is made of wire cages filled with stones, the light peeking through them to cast a mottled pattern on the floor. Are the piers in the 1111 Lincoln Road complex in Miami Beach just solid slabs of concrete? Look closer: They\u2019re as softly textured as old wood, and they gleam like alabaster at sunset. More than simply subverting expectations, the architects practice a kind of radical defamiliarization, using every tool at their disposal to create environments so perfectly off-kilter that they achieve an entirely new kind of balance.  A FEW DAYS BEFORE ART BASEL gets underway, in advance of a busy week of meetings and openings, Herzog takes a moment to reflect. The firm\u2019s offices range over a collection of conjoined buildings, including lofted model warehouses and book-lined meeting rooms; but the weather is warm, the swimmers back in the Rhine, so Herzog is out in one of the open-air courtyards. \u201cI\u2019m someone who leaps into things,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s easy to believe him: Wiry and lean, the architect balances spryly on a porcelain stool. \u201cPierre reveals possibilities to anchor a concept, and then I\u2019m more the person who makes these changes, these jumps,\u201d Herzog continues. The dynamic between the partners has always been an essential feature of their practice, and their differences have only compounded their mystique. Where de Meuron is subdued, contemplative, almost impassive, Herzog is frank and energetic. That two so very distinct personalities have managed to forge an effective partnership is a testament to their years of professional coevolution. Well before the present glut of studios with acronymic titles, H&dM garnered international attention in the 1990s as a relative rarity in a profession then dominated by big-name lone wolves. The firm\u2019s earlier projects, like the 1994 signal box for the Swiss railway, an inscrutable parallelogram of ribbed copper, stood in stark contrast to the work of many contemporaries whose \u201cpersonal interest,\u201d as Herzog sees it, was in \u201crevealing the individual through the gestural stroke.\u201d \n\u201c\n        Our collaboration is a complete involvement, a love affair. it is an act of passion and trust.\n        \u201d\nTrying to recall his earliest thoughts about architecture, de Meuron claims not to have had any. \u201cI had no idea what it was,\u201d he says, and his partner concurs. When the two young men were finishing high school, although both were art enthusiasts steeped in Picasso and Manet, de Meuron thought he would go on to pursue engineering, while Herzog was considering biology and chemistry. Wanting something more, something that combined the humanities and the sciences, the two friends talked through their options, landing on design almost by default. They both enrolled in Zurich\u2019s polytechnic institute. \u201cImmediately I was sucked in,\u201d says de Meuron, \u201cbecause [design] touches so many different domains, so many different disciplines.\u201d The same process of dialogue that led them to their shared m\u00e9tier remains at the center of their approach, always undertaken in the same intrepid spirit. To understand how Herzog and de Meuron progressed from that initial decision, it helps to visit the enormous archive the firm opened in 2014 in its mixed-use building in Basel\u2019s Dreispitz neighborhood. The structure, a sort of neo-brutalist pagoda on one side of a reinvented cultural district (its master plan was also created by the architects), houses a satellite office, fabrication facility and five stories of curios and castoffs dating back to the late 1970s. Among its treasures is one of the first H&dM projects to win public notice, Lego House, a 1985 work composed partly of the famed plastic bricks. Just a couple of feet high, it\u2019s little more than a miniature of a suburban home with a conventional gabled roof\u2014\u201ca form that even children draw,\u201d as Herzog notes. But this was no dollhouse. Originally exhibited at Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, it was stuffed with tiny versions of everyday objects and appeared alongside video stills of the interior, turning it into a meditation on memory and the idea of home.The penchant for evocative artistry has been a staple of the architects\u2019 catalog ever since\u2014as has the gable, the closest thing H&dM has to a signature trope. Elsewhere in the Dreispitz archive are the original concept models for VitraHaus, a flagship for the eponymous furniture maker on its nearby campus. \u201cWe wanted a building that would show to the public that we were very serious about this issue of the home,\u201d says Vitra\u2019s chairman emeritus and board member Rolf Fehlbaum,  who made the headquarters site an architectural wonderland, featuring celebrated buildings by Zaha Hadid and others. Herzog & de Meuron\u2019s contribution, opened in 2009, is a series of oblong houses stacked atop one another, their plain, dark facades capped at both ends by enormous windows; inside is a light-filled aerie with curving staircases and warm organic finishes. Fehlbaum was so pleased with the results that he turned to H&dM again for Vitra\u2019s Schaudepot, a brick open-storage facility, completed seven years later, that also features the telltale roofline. \u201cThere\u2019s something anonymous about it,\u201d Fehlbaum says of the motif, \u201csomething that allows a number of associations.\u201d Whatever the formal or cultural source material, the true hallmark of Herzog and de Meuron\u2019s work is their artistic ambition. The scale of that ambition can be measured in the caliber of the artists with whom they regularly collaborate, including Rosemarie Trockel, Michael Craig-Martin and, perhaps most prominently, Ai Weiwei. \u201cOur common ground,\u201d says Ai, \u201cis that we see architecture as an ethical practice\u2026in between the highest aesthetic judgment and the most practical problem solving.\u201d The architects and the artist discovered their shared affinities in 2002; Ai had long been interested in design, and together they won a competition to produce one of H&dM\u2019s highest-profile structures to date: the celebrated Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, a gleaming coil of steel ribbons built in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. The Sino-Swiss team reunited last year to create Hansel & Gretel, an immersive installation at Manhattan\u2019s Park Avenue Armory that confronted visitors with projected images of their own movements as tracked by overhead drones. A sharp-eyed critique of the 21st-century surveillance state, it was a project very close to the artist\u2019s heart, and he found the architects well attuned to his ideas, capable of creating an environment that could spark a sense of information overload and anxiety, topics that have long been among Ai\u2019s chief preoccupations. \u201cOur collaboration is a complete involvement, a love affair,\u201d says Ai. \u201cIt is an act of passion and trust.\u201d  ONE DAY IN EARLY JUNE, Pierre de Meuron is in Kleinbasel to attend the groundbreaking of one of the firm\u2019s newest undertakings, the second tower for pharmaceutical giant Roche. Nearly identical to its predecessor, the high-rise will make a double icon out of what is already the most recognizable figure on the Basel skyline. In suit and tie, de Meuron blends almost seamlessly with his corporate clients, and as he picks up the ceremonial spade he seems somewhat embarrassed to be the center of attention.\u201cIf you\u2019d [told] me when I was 5 or 10 that I would do most of the buildings on that site,\u201d says de Meuron, laughing. Still evidently bewildered by his own success, the architect is hardly less determined to capitalize on it than his energetic partner. A couple of weeks later, de Meuron is in New York preparing for a prospective client meeting in the lobby of the Public hotel. Opened only last year, the Lower East Side hot spot has already become a local standby, and the upstairs lounges are crowded with creatives in various attitudes of hip\u2014an unlikely setting for a sexagenarian Swiss in business attire. But then H&dM\u2019s sense of chic has always involved an element of the improbable. Ian Schrager, the hospitality magnate behind the Public, has sought out the firm for that very reason, beginning with their first collaboration, the nearby 40 Bond condominium completed in 2007, and continuing through to the brand-new 160 Leroy residential mid-rise. All of their projects together, Schrager notes, have been risky bets on high design in unlikely urban locales, which suits the developer\u2019s style. \u201cI like to pull a rabbit out of my hat,\u201d says Schrager. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that I really want to build, I build it with them.\u201d It doesn\u2019t hurt, the developer adds, that \u201cthey\u2019re very sensitive and intelligent about the budget.\u201dThis aptitude for combining the avant-garde with the pragmatic helped the firm score the commission for the new Upper East Side home of Dasha Zhukova, the international collector and the founder of Moscow\u2019s Garage Museum of Contemporary Art. The particulars of the design remain very much under wraps, but Zhukova confirms that the facade will feature a pattern of inverted brickwork, a subtle nod to the surrounding buildings that still preserves \u201ca flicker of innovation.\u201d \u201cOne of the special things about them as architects is that they\u2019re always thinking about the economic, political, even the spiritual landscape, as well as the practical,\u201d Zhukova says. \u201cThey think about civilization as much as functionalism.\u201d On a sensitive residential project like this one, the client\u2019s baseline prerequisites come first, but H&dM\u2019s subversive streak is bound to assert itself.Part of being subversive means being secretive, a quality rare among architects and one at which the Basel duo excel. Back at firm headquarters, whole studios are closed-door affairs, with clandestine projects in the works. The compound teems with young employees from around the world, an atmosphere \u201clike a college campus,\u201d as Schrager puts it, or maybe more like a government laboratory. Even the precise nature of the founders\u2019 collaboration\u2014who makes what decision and when\u2014is something of a mystery, and according to Herzog, that\u2019s just the way they like it. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really revealed what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be wrong.\u201d The coyness seems at odds with an office that also prefers to be \u201cf\u2014ing straightforward,\u201d as Herzog adds, punching the air with his fist. Then again, it\u2019s not clear that any explanation, either for the practice or for its projects, would be half as gratifying as the mental revolutions one experiences when encountering a Herzog & de Meuron building for the first time. With all that the architects\u2019 work has to reveal, their greatest innovations are the ones still waiting to be discovered.
