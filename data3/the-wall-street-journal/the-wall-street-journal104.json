{"id": "\n        Netflix Sees Oscar Gold in \u2018Roma,\u2019 but Hollywood Isn\u2019t So Sure\n      ", "paragraph": "November 17, 2018https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-sees-oscar-gold-in-roma-but-hollywood-isnt-so-sure-1542464971 Los Angeles  Netflix Inc.\u2019s shiny new lobby looks like the bedroom of a Little League champion\u2014full of trophies for the television programming that has made the streaming service into one of the industry\u2019s most powerful players.Blink and you\u2019ll miss the Oscar among the Emmys and Peabodys, a 2017 prize for \u201cThe White Helmets,\u201d which won best documentary short.This year, Netflix has its best shot yet at a major Academy Award with \u201cRoma,\u201d a portrait of a live-in nanny in 1970s Mexico City directed by Oscar winner Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. It opens in a few theaters later this month and begins streaming in December, but awards pundits already consider it among the front-runners for best picture, best director and best foreign-language film. First, however, Netflix executives must contend with forces within Hollywood that have no interest in helping the company win a major Oscar. Though watching a new movie on Netflix might seem unremarkable to the average consumer, the rollout of \u201cRoma\u201d has reignited a debate within Hollywood about whether a movie that doesn\u2019t get a meaningful big-screen release should even be considered a movie. Netflix declined to comment on \u201cRoma\u2019s\u201d Academy Award prospects. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company has had Oscar hopefuls before, such as 2015\u2019s \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d and last year\u2019s \u201cMudbound.\u201d It won the best documentary award last year for \u201cIcarus,\u201d on the Russian doping operations. But executives at traditional studios say \u201cRoma\u201d is the first time Netflix is playing in their sandbox, with a marquee director and a movie widely considered best-picture material. The movies to see this holiday season: This year\u2019s winter films turn up the drama in \u2018Ben Is Back\u2019 and \u2018If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019 while providing moviegoers some escape from reality in \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019 and a new \u2018Spider-Man\u2019For a company built on a subscription model, winning a best-picture Oscar is about more than just bragging rights. It would help Netflix convince more filmmakers of Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s caliber to come on board, potentially attracting more subscribers. In turn, their monthly $10.99 payments would subsidize movies and awards campaigns for years to come. Netflix bought distribution rights to \u201cRoma\u201d after Mr. Cuar\u00f3n and Participant Media, which financed the budget of about $15 million, screened 10 minutes of footage for potential buyers. Executives from traditional studios were quick to point out the film\u2019s commercial drawbacks. \u201cWe love the film. We all cried,\u201d Mr. Cuar\u00f3n said the executives would tell him and his associates, before launching into the liabilities. \u201cIt\u2019s in Spanish. With nonactors. In black-and-white.\u201dNetflix didn\u2019t voice such concerns, said Mr. Cuar\u00f3n. But its longstanding refusal to grant movies an exclusive theatrical release presented a problem for a director known for big-screen spectacle like the long tracking shots of his dystopian thriller \u201cChildren of Men\u201d or the outer-space special effects of \u201cGravity,\u201d for which he won the best-director Oscar in 2014. And a straight-to-Netflix release would likely alienate Academy members who remain purists about only awarding films with a major theatrical rollout, not just those that receive a qualifying run in at least one Los Angeles theater. Netflix\u2019s initial conversations with Mr. Cuar\u00f3n guaranteed some kind of theatrical treatment for \u201cRoma.\u201d That proved easier said than done. Major U.S. theater chains like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            AMC Entertainment Holdings\n Inc.\n\n\n      and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Cinemark Holdings\n            \n\n\n      have consistently avoided showing movies that open around the same time as their streaming release. That left Netflix with only a handful of independent cinemas to show \u201cRoma.\u201d \u201cThis is a token release, a little gesture to play in cinemas for a little while and get awards,\u201d said John Fithian,  president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, the exhibitors\u2019 main lobbying group.Netflix appears determined to get as many people to watch \u201cRoma\u201d on the big screen as possible. It has taken \u201cRoma\u201d to film festivals all over the world, from Cairo to Toronto, Key West to Tokyo and Scottsdale to Mumbai.Though the film explores the private life of a young woman living with an upper-middle-class family, \u201cRoma\u201d features scenes of cinematic spectacle: Long shots featuring a human cannonball, dozens of young men in choreographed martial-arts exercises, a sequence featuring hundreds of student protesters storming the streets of Mexico City. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n, for his part, thinks the best way to see it is in a theater, too. \u201cThe cinema experience and theatergoing experience is still the ultimate experience,\u201d he said. But he can hardly get his own children to the theater to see a movie, he said, \u201cno matter how much I beg.\u201d The Netflix rollout of \u201cRoma,\u201d he said, is a compromise. \u201cThe two models, they can coexist,\u201d Mr. Cuar\u00f3n said. Netflix is learning just what winning the best-picture Oscar entails. The awards season in Hollywood has stretched into six months of schmoozing, coordinated by strategists who know how to glad-hand every Academy member and craft a narrative around why their client is the most deserving winner. In July, Netflix signaled to Hollywood that it was in the awards game for good, acquiring a prominent awards-consulting firm that has helped numerous movies win a raft of Oscars. The firm, LT-LA, is run by veteran strategist Lisa Taback,  a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of awards-campaign guru Harvey Weinstein who is known throughout the industry for an encyclopedic understanding of the dinners, cocktail parties and baby-kissing that build a successful voter-charming campaign. She has led campaigns for movies like \u201cLa La Land\u201d (14 nominations, six wins), \u201cSpotlight\u201d (six nominations, two wins) and \u201cChicago\u201d (12 nominations, six wins).While \u201cRoma\u201d may be Ms. Taback\u2019s first big test at Netflix, it\u2019s one she\u2019ll soon face again. Martin Scorsese is in production now on \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d a Netflix mob thriller starring Robert De Niro that many in Hollywood suspect will also try for a theatrical release and awards consideration.Netflix won\u2019t report box-office figures for the \u201cRoma\u201d limited release, leading some competing studios to complain that it\u2019s gaining the public-relations advantages of a theatrical release without the potential liabilities. Universal\u2019s \u201cFirst Man,\u201d for instance, has seen its awards momentum slow among pundits since it underperformed at the box office. (Universal declined to comment.)\u201cThat\u2019ll be their message: We sent it to theaters like you wanted,\u201d griped one rival awards campaigner. Some Academy members may be warming to streamers. At 81 years old and with two Oscars for best editing (\u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit,\u201d \u201cForrest Gump\u201d), Arthur Schmidt might seem like the kind of Academy constituent not interested in the Netflix model. But the Santa Barbara, Calif., retiree said watching on the streaming service isn\u2019t much different than watching the DVD \u201cscreeners\u201d of awards hopefuls that studios send every year. \u201cI would prefer to see it in the cinema because it\u2019s the dark cinema and it\u2019s a commitment,\u201d said Mr. Schmidt. \u201cBut for so many years we\u2019ve been getting the DVDs and that\u2019s been a wonderful convenience.\u201dMr. Cuar\u00f3n himself has mixed feelings about the obsession with awards. Speaking at a press conference last year following the production wrap of \u201cRoma,\u201d he said Hollywood overthinks the prize.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t give it more importance than it deserves,\u201d he said.
