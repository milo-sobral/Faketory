{"id": "The Wall Street JournalMagazine\n        Jonah Hill Makes Directing Look Easy\n      ", "paragraph": "November 17, 2018https://www.wsj.com/articles/jonah-hill-makes-directing-look-easy-1540915111 JONAH HILL WROTE and directed one of the best movies of the year. I\u2019ll stop and do it for you here: Jonah Hill? Yes, Jonah Hill. Now, here I could spend the next 2,000 words regaling you with all the reasons that any surprise over the strength of Hill\u2019s debut feature is unfair\u2014rude, really\u2014because while Hill, who is 34, may have launched to fame in 2007 as a smartass comic imp in Superbad, he quickly and nimbly repositioned himself, still in his 20s, into a brilliant character actor, working with some of the greatest directors. I could yank up the IMDb to show that Hill has collaborated with, among others, Judd Apatow (in The 40-Year-Old Virgin; Knocked Up), Bennett Miller (Moneyball), Quentin Tarantino (Django Unchained), Martin Scorsese (The Wolf of Wall Street) and the Coen brothers (Hail, Caesar!)\u2014what Hill refers to as \u201cthe best film school in the world.\u201d I could remind you that Hill has been nominated for best supporting actor Oscars twice\u2014as Brad Pitt\u2019s numbers-crunching prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Moneyball and as Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s drug-vacuuming consigliere in The Wolf of Wall Street. But I know how it is. I could tell you all these things, and you\u2019d still come back to me with a look: Jonah Hill wrote and directed one of the best movies of the year? It\u2019s OK. This is how narratives develop\u2014sometimes fairly, sometimes not. And it is pretty crazy, even to Hill, all of what\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s midafternoon in New York City, and we are in the airy offices of A24, the boutique studio releasing Hill\u2019s film, Mid90s. Dressed in a crisp white shirt and black pants\u2014conservative attire for a man recently photographed bopping down the street in a Phoenix Suns basketball jersey\u2014Hill bounces as if he\u2019s an expectant father in the waiting room. Mid90s is fresh from its September premiere at the Toronto film festival, where it got strong reviews, so A24 is allowing Hill to go back in and add a few final flourishes, like the Next Auteur he very well may be. \u201cHeaven,\u201d Hill says, beaming and taking a sip from his bottled water. \u201cI love being in this world. I could edit it for five more years.\u201dSometimes you interview people in the movie business and it\u2019s clear that, while they may like the film they\u2019re promoting, it\u2019s a job, and they have their stories and quotable lines dialed in and soon will be on to the next shiny object. Hill does not give off that impression. Making Mid90s seems to have filtered deeply into his bones. (And atop his skin\u2014Hill now has a tattoo on his arm that reads STRONG BABY and features a baby lifting a barbell, a nod to one of the funnier scenes in the movie.) All he wants to do is stuff like this, he says. \u201cI just want to make things from my heart,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThat\u2019s all I care about, making things. If there\u2019s a great part, I\u2019m lucky enough to get a great part. If I\u2019m lucky enough to write another film that means something to me and direct it.... I want to make things with people I love.\u201dIt\u2019s the kind of earnest mission statement that might have provoked Hill\u2019s Superbad character, Seth, to bang his head against a locker door. But after a few minutes with Hill, you realize this Hill is closer to the real one. In conversation, he is self-aware, sensitive, effusive. He gushes. He loves. If you\u2019re expecting a snarky quip machine, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\u201cJonah has this openness,\u201d says Hill\u2019s good friend Emma Stone, who starred with him 11 years ago in Superbad and recently reunited with him in the surreal Netflix series Maniac. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt so loving and connected to him, because whenever we\u2019d talk, it was just the most raw, sweet thing\u2014the way he expressed himself. I love that quality in people; it\u2019s rare. I\u2019ve been watching him in everything he\u2019s done, and I\u2019ve been blown away. Jonah\u2019s hysterically funny, but I also think he\u2019s heartbreaking. I really do think he\u2019s a genius.\u201dHill\u2019s new film is putatively about a small group of teen skateboarders in Los Angeles, but skateboards are just an entry point. Set before the millennium, as its title says\u2014pre-iPhones, pre-Yeezys, pre\u2013everyone being terrible to each other on social media\u2014Mid90s is really an immersive look at male adolescence and all its conflicting joys and toxicities. It owes more than a small debt to Kids, director Larry Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine\u2019s gritty firecracker about New York teens. (It\u2019s a knowing homage\u2014Korine has a cameo in the film.) Mid90s is not as bleak as Kids, but it does not airbrush the skateboard scene like a Mountain Dew commercial. Hill\u2019s movie harks back to an era when the activity was rough, DIY and marginalized, illegal in some settings and definitely not cool with every parent. At its center, Mid90s tells the story of Stevie (played by Sunny Suljic), an undersize kid with a single mom (Katherine Waterston) and a menacing older brother (Lucas Hedges) who finds comfort in a crew of skaters at a local shop. Stevie is intoxicated by the rebellion of the scene. Sometimes, he\u2019s just intoxicated. The kids drink, smoke, say horrible things about women and make brainless mistakes. Mid90s is often laugh-out-loud and, at other times, harrowing and hard to watch, but it nails the seductive tedium of boys hanging out. It\u2019s a crisp postcard at 82 minutes.The film roiled around inside Hill for years. He\u2019s friends with the director Spike Jonze, and for a time, he tinkered with a script and talked with Jonze about the project, reshaping the idea (originally the skateboarders\u2019 story was told in flashback). Directing appealed to Hill, but he hadn\u2019t quite summoned the nerve until he went to see then-29-year-old director Damien Chazelle\u2019s Whiplash with Jonze and Bennett Miller, who directed him in Moneyball. As Chazelle\u2019s name flashed on the screen, Hill says, \u201cBennett turned to me and said, \u2018That guy\u2019s younger than you\u2026you better get to it.\u2019 \u201d Hill smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s what really kicked my ass into gear. I have to thank Damien Chazelle if I ever meet him.\u201dHill is an L.A. kid who grew up in an L.A. family not deeply into show business but close enough. An oft-repeated detail of his bio is that his father, Richard Feldstein, served as an accountant for rock clients including Guns N\u2019 Roses. This is not as exotic as it sounds, Hill warns. \u201cMy dad said, \u2018[In L.A.,] even if you\u2019re a dentist, you\u2019re the dentist for so-and-so.\u2019 \u201d Hill\u2019s mother, Sharon Lyn Chalkin, worked for a period as a costume designer and in other jobs on set. His kid sister, Beanie Feldstein, is an actress who played Saoirse Ronan\u2019s best friend in Lady Bird. (\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I can direct, because once the world discovers her, there\u2019s really no use for me,\u201d Hill says of Beanie.) Hill\u2019s older brother, Jordan Feldstein, was the manager of Maroon 5, helping propel the L.A. act to global stardom. Jordan died suddenly last year of a heart attack at age 40: \u201cI love him, and I miss him very much. And that\u2019s really all I\u2019m gonna say about that,\u201d Hill says of his brother. It\u2019s a quote he\u2019s given before, in an interview with New York magazine, and the only topic Hill declines to elaborate on.Like his Mid90s protagonist, Stevie, Hill was drawn to skateboarding in his childhood\u2014he describes himself as enthusiastic but \u201cnot very good.\u201d \u201cStill, it came into my life at a time where I really needed it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a group of outsiders who found one another.\u201d Mid90s ripples with hyperprecise period details and cameos that will please the hard-to-impress skate crowd. Its soundtrack is an utter banger\u2014I haven\u2019t stopped listening to the Pharcyde since I saw it. (Oscar-winning musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross contributed to the score.) But what really pops is its cast. Hill turned to real skaters, with limited or no acting backgrounds, and coaxed moving performances from all of them (there are a handful of true pros, like Hedges, who got an Oscar nomination for Manchester by the Sea). He hunted for talent in skate parks\u2014it\u2019s where he found Suljic, who, hilariously, had to skate worse than he\u2019s capable of to play the newbie Stevie. Given all the youth and lack of experience, camaraderie was important, Hill says. He had flashbacks to Superbad, when he himself was barely underway as an actor. \u201cNow I am the old guy at the table,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cLike the dad. Everyone\u2019s sitting around at lunch roasting each other, it\u2019s so fun.\u201d One day, Hill noticed one of the skater/actors, Olan Prenatt, looking pensively at something below the table. \u201cI look down, and he has his rumpled-up script under the table, and he\u2019s working his ass off,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI went outside and cried. I was emotional. He worked so hard.\u201d\u201cJonah\u2019s an amazing actor, and he explains it from an actor perspective,\u201d says Suljic, who had one significant credit (Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Killing of a Sacred Deer) before taking on an intense part in which he\u2019s on-screen for virtually the entire film. \u201cHe also just came at me as a friend. He made it comfortable for me and the cast to just, like, go all out.\u201d  Mid90s moves fluidly and it crackles with life\u2014to the point it seems improvised, but it\u2019s almost all in Hill\u2019s script. It\u2019s a paradoxical feat, a director and crew working their guts out to make a film feel like it was done on the fly. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of work in naturalism if it\u2019s not naturalism,\u201d Hill explains.There\u2019s a scene midway through the movie that speaks to this achievement. Stevie and the crew have come to a local skate hangout teeming with life\u2014skaters doing tricks, homeless people clustered on the outskirts. There\u2019s a moving interaction between Stevie\u2019s crew and a homeless man (played by the rapper Del the Funky Homosapien), but what\u2019s most striking about the scene is all the concurrent action\u2014there are a thousand things happening at once, all around, and the scene envelops you, as if you\u2019ve parachuted into a real-life skate world. Hill says the moment was at least partly inspired by his time around Scorsese in The Wolf of Wall Street, and how the 75-year-old director and his cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto, labored to create elaborate, artful scenes.\u201cYou do so much work to build this thing, that by the time the actors get there, they don\u2019t even know a movie\u2019s happening,\u201d Hill says. On Wolf, \u201cI would walk in with Leo [DiCaprio] and we\u2019d shoot. But Rodrigo and Marty, they\u2019d done the work.\u201d That\u2019s also Hill\u2019s style, says Mid90s producer Eli Bush. \u201cJonah has a crazy work ethic,\u201d Bush says. \u201cHe puts in the work, he puts in the time. He spent a lot of time in a kind of film school and has a huge amount of respect for the craft and [its] heroes. He really put in the effort.\u201dCould Hill be planning to walk away from acting to focus on directorial work? Acting remains part of his agenda, Hill says\u2014he just needs a good reason to do it. For Netflix\u2019s Maniac, a darkly comic series in which Hill and Emma Stone play troubled souls seeking inner peace in a radical pharmaceutical trial, his reason was simple: He wanted to work with his friend Emma again. \u201cHonestly, I wanted to hang out with her,\u201d Hill says. \u201cWe\u2019re both so busy, we never get to hang out. I was like, \u2018OK, cool, I get to work with Emma? Amazing.\u2019 \u201dThe pair had not worked together since Superbad\u2014Stone\u2019s first movie\u2014and one of the many odd pleasures of Maniac is seeing how far Superbad\u2019s Seth and Jules have come in the decade since home economics class. Hill and Stone now have four Oscar nominations between them, with Stone winning best actress last year for La La Land, which, of course, was directed by Chazelle, who inspired Hill to direct Mid90s and\u2014it\u2019s all perfect.\u201cShe\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Hill says. \u201cTo see how she\u2019s flourished as an actor?\u201d He shakes his head.Before we go, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t address Hill\u2019s side life as a style maven. In the Instagram era, he has become something of an exemplar of unselfconscious cool, mixing hypercurrent streetwear with sui generis personal touches. A Jonah Hill outfit is ready for anything, anytime. For the past couple of years, fans have gathered in Brooklyn to celebrate Jonah Hill Day, which Hill himself attended this summer (and showed up an hour early for, awkwardly). The internet is full of photos and tributes to Hill fashion: a flowing brown overcoat, tie-dyes, soccer shirts, a brief interlude with pink hair. The attention appears to delight him. \u201cIt\u2019s really flattering, because I do love fashion, and I do care about style,\u201d Hill says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been amazing to have your style recognized. It\u2019s so personal, you know.\u201d Sometimes, he will purposely have fun with it\u2014as in the case of that Phoenix Suns jersey, which he ridiculously tucked into his pants before going outside for a walk. Photos of a smiling Hill in the curious get-up immediately went viral. \u201cI was trying to make my sister laugh,\u201d he says now. \u201cI looked in the mirror and I was like, \u2018This is sick. I\u2019m wearing dress shoes, dress pants and a basketball jersey.\u2019 I knew [paparazzi] were going to photograph me, because they\u2019re always just outside of my house. So I had fun with it. It was me playing with everyone. That\u2019s me commenting on the joke.\u201dIt\u2019s such a strange planet now. A famous man can walk outside in a funny shirt, and a few hours later, it\u2019s a global sensation, shared like photos of a moon landing. \u201cMore people will see that than [Mid90s]!\u201d Hill exclaims. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at in the world. But it\u2019s just where we\u2019re at, you know?\u201d \u2022\u00a0 Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comHow the Record-Breaking Sale of a Lichtenstein Painting Changed Agnes Gund\u2019s LifeAn art collector and patron turns her talents to criminal justice.Click to Read StoryDavid Chang\u2019s Culinary Universe Is Still Growing\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Be better or f\u2014ing see you later.\u2019\u201dClick to Read StoryAdvertisementIn \u2018Black Panther,\u2019 Costume Designer Ruth E.
