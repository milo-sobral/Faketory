{"id": "Trump falsely claims Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams wants to \u2018get rid of\u2019 the Second Amendment, but Abrams says she supports it", "paragraph": " President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams would \"get rid of\" the Second Amendment if elected, though the Democrat has stated on several occasions that she believes in the right to bear arms.  Speaking during a rally for Republican Brian Kemp in Macon, the president suggested that in addition to ending the Second Amendment \u2014 a power that governors do not possess \u2014 people will be sent door to door to collect all existing firearms. Trump also claimed that electing Abrams would turn the state of Georgia into the nation of Venezuela without providing evidence.  Trump appeared to be referencing a 2016  gun safety bill that Abrams co-sponsored when she was a state lawmaker, that proposed a ban on certain assault weapons. The bill was unlike others of its kind in that it wouldn't grandfather in people who already own assault weapons, and would require them to turn these firearms over to authorities.

But I believe that our responsibility is to make certain that the most vulnerable in our society do not face those who are irresponsible with their weapons,\" she said.  Abrams and Kemp  are currently neck and neck in the Georgia governor's race. In recent days both former President Obama and Oprah have campaigned for Abrams, who would become the nation's first black female governor if elected. "}
