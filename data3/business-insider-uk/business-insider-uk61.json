Boka                                     Everyone brushes their teeth every day, but it's not every day you hear someone say she does so with a toothbrush that helps expand oral health access for those in need, or with a toothpaste that contains an ingredient invented by NASA. Boka is the online company with a mission of improving your oral health, and it doesn't cut any corners in helping you accomplish that goal. Like Quip and Goby, it's a direct-to-consumer brand that makes brushing your teeth convenient, affordable, and surprisingly exciting.  Boka sells the essentials for good oral care, including an electric toothbrush, replacement brush heads, toothpaste, and floss. This description sounds basic until you delve into the details of each component.                                             Boka                                     The rechargeable electric toothbrush, which operates at a steady and efficient 30,000 vibrations a minute, has soft activated charcoal bristles to limit bacteria growth and provide a more gentle brushing experience. It has a two-minute timer, and in my experience, the twice-daily two-minute ritual is always pleasant and leaves my teeth feeling and looking clean. The toothbrush docks to a charging station so it's ready to go at all times.  Use the toothbrush with Boka's fluoride-free toothpaste, which contains nano-hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite makes up the mineral part of your bones and teeth and was first developed by NASA to help astronauts who lost teeth and bone mineral in the absence of gravity. Thus, the Ela Mint toothpaste doesn't only fight plaque, but it also actively and naturally repairs tooth enamel and helps reduce tooth sensitivity. Many name brand toothpastes are too harsh on my gums and I'm still trying to pinpoint the exact source. Notably, the Boka Ela Mint toothpaste didn't cause me any problems, and it tastes great, too.  These are Boka's star products, but its oral care accessories like its natural beeswax floss and Cocorinse are also made with effective, better-for-you ingredients. You can shop everything individually, with bundled kits available to save you some money.  Another way to ensure you're taking care of your teeth is to subscribe to one of Boka's brush plans. The starter kit is $60 and includes the electric toothbrush and charging station. Every three months, Boka will send you replenishments of brush heads, toothpaste, and floss, depending on which plan you choose.  While you improve your own oral health, you're helping someone else do the same. For every brush purchased, Boka donates one to Surge, a non-profit that brings water to those in need. It's a win-win situation: you take care of your teeth, you help someone take care of theirs, and you pay a reasaonable price to do it all.
