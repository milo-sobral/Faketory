Grado                                     For 65 years, Grado's headphones have shared many of the same features: they're all handmade in Brooklyn, have an open-back design, and use a thick, long cable.  That all changes with the GW100s, Grado's first pair of Bluetooth headphones.  I was sent a pair to test out, and over the past couple of weeks I've been seriously impressed at how well Grado managed to transition from wired to wireless headphones.  The first thing I noticed about the GW100s was their look and feel. Grado's headphones have always looked distinctly futuristic yet somehow classic, and that's definitely true of the GW100s. Their all-black color, small circular ear cups, and mesh grills make them look extremely cool.  They're also very light \u2014 so much so that I actually forgot I was wearing them a couple of times. The ear cups have foam pads, which make them comfortable to wear for long listening sessions and don't make my ears sweat. The headband has enough padding that my head doesn't hurt even when they've been on for several hours.                                             Grado                                     The GW100s carry Grado's signature open-back design, which means their ear cups aren't covered like they are on most modern headphones. The downside is that sound can leak in and out of the headphones, so people around you will definitely be able to hear what you're listening to if you're sitting close to them in a quiet environment.  You'll also be able to hear what's going on around you, which is basically the opposite of noise cancellation. I didn't notice sound leaking in when I was listening to music, but it was very apparent if I wasn't.  Grado says this pair of headphones was designed to \"diminish\" escaping sound by up to 60%, and I agree that they do leak significantly less sound than the company's wired headphones, but it's still something you need to consider if you're looking for headphones to wear to the office or on your commute. Granted, I didn't notice anybody who seemed bothered when I wore them at my desk or on the subway.  The upside to their open-back design is that music does sound more natural than it does coming from closed-back headphones. It's closer to listening to music using speakers in an open room, which can make music, especially live tracks, sound incredible.  I sampled everything from podcasts to pop, hip hop, jazz, and R&B, and was always happy with the way the GW100s sounded. They are a little treble heavy, but not so much so that it really bothered me. Instead, I appreciated how clear the music sounded.  Like I said earlier, the standout music to listen to with these headphones is live albums, but I could also pick up on a lot of details on studio tracks. To hear music sound this good, you typically have to spend at least another $100, so I give Grado a lot of credit.                                             Grado                                     My only complaint about the GW100s is that they charge over Micro USB instead of USB-C. This is a minor detail, but one that's worth pointing out. You're going to want to wear these headphones for several years, so it's a shame that Grado didn't put a more modern charging port on them.  That aside, Grado really knocked it out of the park. The GW100's are a pleasure to look at, wear, and listen to.  If you're an audiophile who's worn Grado's wired headphones, the GW100s fit right in with the sound and style you've come to expect. For people who are new to the company's hardware, you're in for a real treat \u2014 this is easily the best way to spend $250 on a pair of headphones.
