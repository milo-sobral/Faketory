Town & Country on Monday published an interview between Oprah Winfrey and Obama, whose new memoir, \"Becoming,\" is set to be released Tuesday.  The women discussed the former first lady's journey from her working-class upbringing on the South Side of Chicago to becoming a lawyer, and Obama described her sense of pushing herself on a particular life path:  \"In the book, I take you on the journey of who that little striving star-getter became, which is what a lot of hard-driving kids become: a box checker. Get good grades: check. Apply to the best schools, get into Princeton: check. Get there, what's your major? Uh, something that's going to get me good grades so I can get into law school, I guess? Check. Get through law school: check.\"  Obama did not enjoy her time in a law firm.

The luxury to even be able to decide \u2014 when she didn't get to go back to work and start finding herself until after she got us into high school. So, yes. It was hard.\"  Eventually, she met her husband, Barack Obama, who she said was \"the opposite of a box checker.\"  \"He was swerving all over the place,\" she said.
