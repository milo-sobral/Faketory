{"id": "This futuristic hotel is going to be built at the base of a glacier in remote, northern Norway \u2014 and it looks like it's straight out of a sci-fi movie", "paragraph": " Luxury will meet adventure in a remote Norwegian hotel set right at the edge of a glacier.  If the eye-catching design is not enough, consider its eco-friendly origins \u2014 and its broader location: Svart Hotel is set to be the world's first energy-positive hotel above the Arctic circle.  In fact, according to a press release from the hotel, the hotel, which is a collaboration between Arctic Adventure of Norway, architecture firm Snoh\u00f8etta, and Powerhouse, will use 85% less energy than a traditional hotel in addition to producing its own energy.  The hotel will be in northern Norway, in the Mel\u00f8y municipality at the foot of the Svartisen glacier. For frame of reference, that's about 800 miles north of Oslo, the capital of Norway.  The location also served as inspiration for the project in more ways than one.  \"Building an energy positive and low-impact hotel is an essential factor to create a sustainable tourist destination respecting the unique features of the plot; the rare plant species, the clean waters and the blue ice of the Svartisen glacier,\" Kjetil Tr\u00e6dal Thorsen, Founding Partner at Sn\u00f8hetta, said in the hotel's press release.  Though the hotel isn't set to open until 2021, the zoning plan was approved by the municipality ofMel\u00f8y in October, and, judging by its sleek design, it's likely to quickly lodge itself onto lists of hotels everyone has to visit in their lifetimes.  Here's a look at the project: Source: Svart HotelSource: Svart HotelSource: Svart HotelSource: Svart HotelSource: Svart HotelSource: Svart HotelSource: Svart Hotel"}
