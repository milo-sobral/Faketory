(AP) \u2014 Lawyers for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services have asked a judge to reverse an attorney general\u2019s decision that the state must disclose details of sexual harassment allegations.The Courier Journal reports a lawsuit was filed against it Wednesday in Franklin County Circuit Court. Cabinet lawyers argue disclosure would invade personal privacy. The lawsuit seeks to conceal details of allegations by the state\u2019s former top social services official, including the name of the state employee she accused.Adria Johnson resigned in June as community based services commissioner after her complaint wasn\u2019t substantiated in an internal investigation.In similar cases recently involving two other agencies, Judge Phillip Shepherd ruled the state can\u2019t withhold names of accused individuals. Courier Journal attorney Michael Abate said he sees no reason for the judge to find otherwise in the new case.___Information from: Courier Journal, http://www.courier-journal.com"}
