{"id": "Analysis: Louisiana political focus set on 2019, not Tuesday", "paragraph": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Though an election looms Tuesday, Louisiana\u2019s politicians, prognosticators, and campaign donors already have moved on, looking to the 2019 races when voters choose the governor, six other statewide elected officials and state lawmakers.That\u2019s the big election year.In political circles, conversations regularly turn to whether Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards can win re-election and which Republicans might enter the race against him, rather than how Louisiana\u2019s congressional incumbents will fare on this week\u2019s ballot or who will fill out a one-year term as secretary of state.Perhaps that\u2019s because the governor historically is the center of Louisiana\u2019s political universe. Or maybe it\u2019s because the U.S. House races are less interesting when no one seems likely to be ousted. Or maybe it\u2019s that folks can\u2019t get jazzed about a secretary of state job that\u2019s largely a ministerial position.Whatever the reason, the 2018 elections have been overshadowed nearly from the start by the 2019 competitions.Republican U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, seemingly ready to jump into the governor\u2019s race against Edwards, isn\u2019t even waiting until the Dec. 8 runoffs wrap up this year\u2019s election cycle. He said he\u2019ll announce whether he\u2019s in or out of the gubernatorial contest by Dec. 1.Kennedy already picked up an early endorsement last week, from Republican state Rep. Jay Morris of Monroe, who emailed supporters saying he hopes Kennedy will run. Morris described Kennedy as bringing \u201ca conservative and common sense approach.\u201d\u201cJohn Kennedy doesn\u2019t kowtow to anyone even if they are powerful donors.  That kind of integrity is rare in government,\u201d Morris wrote.Edwards certainly appears to have moved to campaign mode, with his office releasing weekly videos touting the accomplishments of individual Cabinet agencies since the governor took office in 2016. Outside groups and PACs backing Edwards are active on social media promoting the governor and trashing those who might run against him.Already one GOP candidate has entered the race. Eddie Rispone filed state paperwork in October declaring his candidacy for the election.The wealthy Baton Rouge businessman, founder of an industrial contracting company and longtime donor to conservative candidates isn\u2019t well-known outside of political groups yet. But Rispone said he\u2019s willing to put up $5 million or more of his own money to change that, making him a major contender in the race as soon as he got into it.If he decides to add himself to the gubernatorial candidate list, Kennedy would be a formidable candidate, maintaining high approval ratings with voters. He also wouldn\u2019t have to give up his U.S. Senate seat to run against Edwards, though already speculation is rampant about who might fill that Senate position if Kennedy were to win the governor\u2019s race.Other Republicans still mulling the race include U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, Attorney General Jeff Landry, state Sen. Sharon Hewitt, and Louisiana Association of Business and Industry President Stephen Waguespack. As he seeks re-election to his congressional seat on Tuesday\u2019s ballot, Abraham ran what just as easily could be seen as a biographical ad introducing him to a broader audience in case he enters the governor\u2019s race.Edwards\u2019 approval ratings have hovered around 50 percent in recent polls, and he\u2019s already reported raising $5 million for his re-election bid. He said he\u2019s proud to run on his performance, \u201cand I look forward to earning another four years by continuing to put Louisiana first.\u201dMillions of dollars from donors inside and outside of Louisiana are expected to pour into the race, with Republicans trying to reclaim a seat they feel should be theirs and Democrats trying to hold onto a seat they believe shows their candidates can win in conservative states.Beyond the governor\u2019s race, other statewide incumbents are gearing up re-election bids. Republican Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser recently promoted raising $500,000 during two fundraisers that were described as kick-off events for his 2019 campaign.Term-limited lawmakers are jockeying for other political jobs they can land in the next term.And the winner of this fall\u2019s election for secretary of state will have to turn around and run again next year to hold onto the seat.___EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Melinda Deslatte has covered Louisiana politics for The Associated Press since 2000.
