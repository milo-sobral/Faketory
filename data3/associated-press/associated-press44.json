(New York Police Department via AP)\n            NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Police are investigating the mysterious deaths of two sisters from Saudi Arabia whose bodies, bound together with tape, washed up on New York City\u2019s waterfront last week.The sisters, Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22, were discovered Oct. 24 on a bank of the Hudson River, about 225 miles from Fairfax, Virginia, where they lived and were reported missing in August.As of Tuesday, investigators still had not determined how they died. The sisters\u2019 bodies were taped together and facing each other, but had no obvious signs of trauma, police said. They were both fully clothed.Their mother told detectives the day before the bodies were discovered, she received a call from an official at the Saudi Arabian Embassy, ordering the family to leave the U.S. because her daughters had applied for political asylum, New York police said Tuesday.Saudi Arabia\u2019s Consulate General in New York said in a statement that it had \u201cappointed an attorney to follow the case closely.\u201dNew York City police sent a detective to Virginia to learn more about the sisters. Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said they were particularly interested in finding out what happened since they were reported missing and what led them to New York City.\u201cWe are looking at all clues in their past life,\u201d Shea said.The medical examiner\u2019s office was investigating the cause of death. The lack of obvious trauma appeared to rule out a theory they jumped into the river from the George Washington Bridge.In its statement, the Saudi Consulate General said embassy officials in Washington had contacted the family and \u201cextended its support and aid in this trying time.\u201d It said the sisters were students \u201caccompanying their brother in Washington.\u201dTala and Rotana moved to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia with their mother in 2015, settling in Fairfax, a suburb of Washington D.C., police said.Rotana was enrolled at George Mason University, but left in the spring. A George Mason spokesman called the news of her death \u201ctragic,\u201d and said the university was cooperating with police.Police said the sisters left their family home and were placed in a shelter after an earlier disappearance, in December 2017.They were reported missing again Aug. 24.Police initially struggled to identify the bodies as much of the city and the country was transfixed by another mystery: the package bombs sent to a dozen prominent Democrats and CNN\u2019s New York City bureau.Police released sketches of the sister\u2019s faces and posted repeated calls for the public\u2019s help in identifying them on social media.\u201cWe are out to get justice for those two girls and find out exactly what happened,\u201d Shea said.__Follow Mike Sisak at www.twitter.com/mikesisak"}
