(AP) \u2014 California held a players-only meeting on the eve of their game against Oregon State.The Golden Bears were still searching for their first conference win and had slumped with three straight losses.Seniors talked about how much the season meant to them, said defensive end Tevin Paul. The players took the talk to heart.Patrick Laird ran for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and also caught a scoring pass, and California snapped a three-game losing streak with a 49-7 victory at Oregon State on Saturday.\u201cI feel like it just really helped everyone out,\u201d Paul said, \u201cjust trusting each other.\u201dThe Golden Bears (4-3, 1-3) had not won a Pac-12 game on the road since a victory at Washington in 2015, a string of 14 games. But the victory was marred by two targeting calls against Cal players that resulted ejections.Chase Garbers threw for 234 yards and three touchdowns for the Golden Bears.The Beavers have lost five games overall as well and their last 13 conference games. Oregon State\u2019s lone win this season came against Southern Utah on Sept. 8.\u201cHonestly, we all hate losing, but at the end of the day you\u2019ve got to keep fighting,\u201d Oregon State safety Jalen Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s life, you\u2019ve got to keep fighting. Everything\u2019s not going to go your way, all you can do is keep fighting and stay positive.\u201dOregon State was hurt late in the first half when starting quarterback Conor Blount left the game with a concussion after a helmet to helmet hit by Cal\u2019s Jaylinn Hawkins, who was ejected. Zeandae Johnson was ejected in the third quarter for a hit on third-string Beavers QB Jack Colletto.Garbers, who started at quarterback for Cal after Brandon McIlwain started the last two, found Malik McMorris with a 3-yard scoring pass on Cal\u2019s opening drive of the game. He hit Laird with a 29-yard TD in the second quarter as the Golden Bears went up 14-0.Laird added a 4-yard touchdown run late in the first half.Blount left the game late on Oregon State\u2019s final drive of the half after the helmet-to-helmet hit and Hawkins was called for targeting. Colletto took over. He was hit by Johnson in the third quarter.\u201cTotally unacceptable,\u201d said Cal coach Justin Wilcox. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we stand for as a program. It will be the first thing we talk about on Monday.\u201dWilcox added that players need to have more discipline and cannot lead with their heads.Backup QB Jake Luton was unavailable because of a high-ankle sprain that he sustained on Sept. 15 against Nevada.Cal\u2019s Christopher Brown Jr. scored on a 5-yard run to give the Golden Bears a 28-0 lead early in the second half, but Colletto scored on a 1-yard keeper before the quarter was over to get Oregon State on the scoreboard.Laird scored on a 30-yard run in the fourth quarter before Josh Drayden\u2019s 54-yard interception return with 20 seconds left closed out the scoring.Oregon State freshman Jermar Jefferson, who ranks fourth nationally with an average of 144.2 yards rushing per game, was in uniform and riding a bike on the sideline at the start. The team announced Jefferson had a mild hamstring strain and it was uncertain if he\u2019d play, but he entered the game in the second quarter. He finished with 34 yards rushing.\u201cIt\u2019s tough, it\u2019s real tough,\u201d Beavers receiver Isaiah Hodgins said. \u201cBecause we know we\u2019ve got players and we know we\u2019re a better team than last year. We know we\u2019ve got good coaches and a great team. So it\u2019s just tough to not get the results we want. We\u2019re going to have to switch some things up, get some more energy, prepare better and finish the season strong.\u201dTHE TAKEAWAY:California: Cal linebacker Jordan Kunaszyk had 10 tackles, including eight solo. Kunaszyk had a career-high 22 tackles, including 14 solo, in the Golden Bears\u2019 loss to UCLA last week.
