Steve King is coming under fire ahead of the midterm election as top Republican officials and campaign donors balk at standing with a Republican congressman who regularly espouses extreme views on race and immigration.King is still favored to win another term representing his rural Iowa district in next week\u2019s election. But in the aftermath of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, the congressman\u2019s latest comments in support of a neo-Nazi party in Europe sparked a strong rebuke Tuesday from the House Republicans\u2019 campaign chairman, Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio.\u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate,\u201d said Stivers. \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201dThe Land O\u2019 Lakes Inc. PAC said Tuesday it \u201cwill no longer support Rep. Steve King.\u201d The political action committee, based in neighboring Minnesota, said it wants its contributions \u201cto be a positive force for good\u201d and tries to ensure that \u201crecipients of our contributions uphold our company\u2019s values.\u201dTechnology giant Intel Corp. also said it would no longer support King, according to reports.King on Tuesday posted a tweet denouncing the attacks against him as \u201corchestrated by the nasty, desperate and dishonest fake news. Their ultimate goal is to flip the House and impeach Donald Trump.\u201dThe Iowa congressman has long tested the limits of the Republican Party\u2019s tolerance for fringe views, notably his harsh anti-immigration rhetoric. On Saturday, the day of the deadly Pittsburgh shooting, he defended the groups he associated with, including Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, which was founded by former Nazis.\u201cIf they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans,\u201d King told The Washington Post.King has represented the Sioux City-area congressional district for eight terms, and was so widely expected to win again that the National Republican Congressional Committee has not been spending any resources on the race.NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said that after the accumulation of King\u2019s \u201cbigoted words and actions, the time had come for Chairman Stivers to speak out.\u201dA Democratic challenger, former pro baseball player J.D. Scholten, has been pummeling King with ads, and an outside group has been airing one that suggests the congressman is approved by white supremacists, according to Dave Wasserman, an analyst at the Cook Political Report. That election forecaster on Tuesday shifted King\u2019s race slightly toward the Democrat, while reporting it is still \u201clikely\u201d to be won by the Republican.Still, Wasserman tweeted that King\u2019s campaign is \u201cvirtually broke\u201d and \u201cwith a week left, it\u2019s unclear who\u2019s going to bail him out.\u201d"}
