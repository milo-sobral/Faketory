{"id": "Analysis: Hood\u2019s downcast pitch clashes with sunny GOP take", "paragraph": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 At times, it seemed like the politicians addressing the Mississippi Economic Council last Thursday were mainly there to boost or oppose Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s bid to retain the U.S. Senate seat to which Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her.Lt. Gov Tate Reeves even made it explicit, saying he wasn\u2019t going to talk about the 2019 state elections, which relieved him of affirming that he would indeed run for governor.\u201cThe most important elections to the future of Mississippi\u2019s economy are the ones taking place next Tuesday,\u201d Reeves told attendees at the council\u2019s Hobnob event at the Mississippi Coliseum.But Attorney General Jim Hood, the Democrat who seeks to deny Reeves\u2019 ascension to the governor\u2019s chair, didn\u2019t get the memo. Hood made the case that members of the state\u2019s chamber of commerce should consider supporting him. The organization has stuck close to Reeves, with MEC President Scott Waller praising him Thursday for delivering a signature goal of the group, a phase-out of Mississippi\u2019s franchise tax on business capital.It was an unusually animated speech for Hood, and at times sounded as if it came from an alternate universe rather than the one occupied by the state\u2019s Republican leaders.\u201cThey\u2019re going to tell you how great things are, but let me tell you the truth about what our economy is,\u201d Hood said. \u201cMississippi has the worst economy of any state in the union.\u201dHe also argued that the special session earlier this year that ended in a deal for more money for roads was \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d in part because it didn\u2019t produce as much money as was needed to cover the needs of the state highway system. Hood also criticized Mississippi\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid, arguing that\u2019s the root cause of rural hospital struggles.This is the challenge that Democrats have. Has growth been poky for years in Mississippi coming out the recession? Yes, and it still is, compared to the rest of the nation. But it would have been an easier case to make in 2014 or 2015, when the state\u2019s economy slid back into recession while the rest of the nation was growing. It would have also been easier in 2016 and 2017, when Gov. Phil Bryant was making mid-year budget cuts or lawmakers were whacking the budgets of state agencies.Since then, things have gotten better, both in terms of the economy and state tax receipts. Average weekly wages in the first quarter of 2018 were up about 2 percent, while the state\u2019s economy has added 20,000 jobs this year.\u201cI guess the lowest unemployment in Mississippi\u2019s history just doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Bryant, clearly mocking Hood. \u201cTell that to the 77,000 Mississippians who have a job now that didn\u2019t have a job in 2011.\u201dBryant, taking offense at Hood\u2019s downcast assessment of his two terms in office, threatened to take to the campaign trail to \u201cstrip some bark. I\u2019m not going to stand by and let any politician criticize what we have accomplished.\u201dReeves, for his part, didn\u2019t keep his promise to not talk about 2019. After praising educational improvement and the road funding deal, he offered a preview.\u201cI look forward to talking about our vision for the future of Mississippi \u2014 a vision that includes a balanced budget, a vision that includes less debt on the books, a vision that includes fewer taxes,\u201d he said.Hood will have to overcome that pitch, plus Republican affirmations that things are getting better. But maybe Hood is more aware of this challenge than he lets on. After all, at one point during Thursday\u2019s speech, he said: \u201cLeadership is about telling people something maybe they don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d___Jeff Amy has covered politics and government for The Associated Press in Mississippi since 2011.
