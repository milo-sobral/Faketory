(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n            LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Hollywood is falling short of ethnic equality despite black-led films including \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d actress and award-winning writer Lena Waithe said.There are \u201ca million \u2018La La Lands\u2019 every year. How often do we get a \u2018Moonlight\u2019? How often do we get \u2018Black Panther\u2019?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat to me will be true equality is when \u2018Black Panther\u2019 comes out and it\u2019s just like \u2018Captain America.\u2019\u201dWaithe, an actress and Emmy-winning screenwriter with the streaming comedy \u201cMaster of None\u201d who was in the film \u201cReady Player One,\u201d joined in conversation with comedian Hannah Gadsby at an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lunch.The event marked the launch of Action: The Academy Women\u2019s Initiative, aimed at creating opportunities for female filmmakers to network and celebrate inclusiveness. It included the presentation of a newly established Academy Gold Fellowship to young filmmaker Geeta Malik, writer-director of the award-winning online short \u201cAunty Gs\u201d and films including \u201cBeast\u201d and \u201cTroublemaker.\u201dMusic legend Annie Lennox also spoke at the lunch, recounting how her activism was inspired after hearing South African leader Nelson Mandela describe how the scourge of HIV and AIDS was particularly devastating for women.There are many other crises faced by women and girls worldwide, Lennox said, including sex trafficking, physical and sexual abuse and illiteracy.\u201cThat is why I endorse global feminism,\u201d she said, which encompasses Western nations as well as places where women \u201ccan\u2019t reach the lowest rung.\u201d Men must also be welcomed into the cause, she said.\u201cIf men and boys are excluded from the dialogue, we\u2019re left with the same old misogyny,\u201d Lennox said.Gadsby, an Australian comic who made a splash with her standup special \u201cNanette,\u201d said her autism has made her acutely aware of screen characters who are relegated to the \u201cperiphery\u201d of the action.She said television has become a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that brings such sidelined characters into the forefront of stories.When Gadsby lauded Waithe for bringing diversity to the screen, Waithe said she felt the pressure of falling short as a representative of her ethnic group.\u201cNo straight white man represents anything but himself,\u201d she said.Waithe also touched briefly on TV personality Megyn Kelly\u2019s defense of blackface as a Halloween costume, which led to the cancellation of her NBC \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d morning show. Waithe suggested that blackface was something that whites used to denigrate blacks but, \u201cin a weird way,\u201d also indicated they want to experience being black.\u201cThere\u2019s a love for us. But how do you love us?\u201d she said. \u201cI want us to cherish Trayvon Martin alive, as much as we do when he\u2019s gone,\u201d referring to the unarmed African-American teenager shot to death in Florida by a former neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012.Amy Adams, Anika Noni Rose, Rashida Jones and Lily Collins were among those attending the event held by the academy and initiative partners E! Entertainment and Swarovski.___Follow Lynn Elber on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber"}
