(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n            FRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott played off each other in a season-saving win over Philadelphia much the same way they did during their remarkable rookie year together in 2016.Now the star quarterback and running back of the Dallas Cowboys need a winning streak, although it won\u2019t have to be as long as the franchise-record run two years ago, the last time they made the playoffs.\u201cI don\u2019t go back and look and try to compare now to then,\u201d Prescott said after throwing for a touchdown and running for one in a 27-20 win . \u201cThis is the team we have and this is when everything is clicking and we\u2019re playing the way we need to be playing. This is what we\u2019re capable of.\u201dThe Cowboys (4-5) were in a desperate spot visiting the defending champion Eagles because of an up-and-down season notable for its struggles on offense. Now that they have their first road win, they have to do it again Sunday at Atlanta (4-5).Dallas and Philadelphia trail NFC East-leading Washington by two games with seven remaining. The Cowboys have one more game against each rival, having lost to the Redskins on the road.\u201cWe needed this just as bad as we need every win going forward,\u201d defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford said. \u201cI call it a movement because that\u2019s the only thing we can do now is get \u2018dubs.\u2019 We can\u2019t take no \u2019L\u2019s.\u201dAgainst Philadelphia, coach Jason Garrett dumped a conservative approach that was costly in a couple of losses by planning to go for it on fourth down in Dallas territory on the first play of the second quarter before a false start aborted that bold move.The Cowboys faked a punt later in the quarter, which led to Elliott almost cleanly hurdling Tre Sullivan before a stumble on a clear path to the end zone forced Dallas to settle for a field goal. At the time, it sort of symbolized the season for an inconsistent offense.Still, Elliott had 151 yards rushing and a touchdown, with another 36 yards receiving and a score. Prescott\u2019s line looked similar to 2016 as well: 270 yards passing, no turnovers and a 100-plus rating.The 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year led two 75-yard drives to touchdowns in the fourth quarter, both of them answers to tying TDs from the Eagles. Elliott finished off each of them after big plays to several receivers along the way.\u201cIt just showed the attitude of this team going into this game,\u201d said Elliott, who surged two spots to second in the NFL in rushing behind MVP contender Todd Gurley of the Rams. \u201cWe knew we had to win. I\u2019m proud of these guys.\u201dThe Cowboys ran off 11 straight wins when Prescott and Elliott were rookies on the way to an NFC-best 13 wins. Dallas slipped to 9-7 and out of the playoffs last season with a deteriorating performance from the offense.The receivers have struggled without Dez Bryant, released in the offseason, but appear to be benefiting from the trade for Amari Cooper, acquired from Oakland for a first-round pick.Injuries and mistakes in an offensive line that has been one of the NFL\u2019s best in recent years have at times made things difficult for Elliott and contributed to Prescott already matching last year\u2019s career high of 32 sacks barely more than halfway through the season. But that line stood out against the Eagles.\u201cThis is a winning team and it\u2019s great when you go on the road and win,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us just to feel that energy in the locker room and to make sure we don\u2019t forget that. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do every time that we go on the road, or every game.\u201dNOTES: Garrett said he received a \u201cfavorable report\u201d on RG Zack Martin, who missed part of the Philadelphia game when he aggravated the left knee injury he\u2019s been battling since hyperextending the knee in the preseason. ... LG Xavier Su\u2019a-Filo had a solid game filling in for injured rookie Connor Williams, who had arthroscopic knee surgery last week. Garrett said the team hasn\u2019t made any determinations on who would start when Williams is ready to return.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
