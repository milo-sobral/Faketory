(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n            WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 An associate of longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone said Monday that he expects to face charges in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.Conservative conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi said on his YouTube show that negotiations fell apart with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team and he expects in the coming days to be charged with making false statements.\u201cI\u2019m going to be indicted,\u201d Corsi said on his show. \u201cThat\u2019s what we were told. Everyone should know that, and I\u2019m anticipating it.\u201dThe Associated Press couldn\u2019t immediately confirm Corsi\u2019s claims that charges against him are forthcoming. Corsi\u2019s attorney, David Gray, declined to comment Monday evening. A spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office also declined to comment.Corsi is one of several Stone associates who have been questioned by investigators as Mueller probes Stone\u2019s connections with WikiLeaks. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian agents were the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, including emails belonging to former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. And Mueller\u2019s office is trying to determine whether Stone and other associates of President Donald Trump had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans.Corsi, the former Washington bureau chief of the conspiracy theory outlet InfoWars, said Monday that he had no recollection of ever meeting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\u201cTo the best of my recollection, what I knew in advance about what Julian Assange was going to do in terms of having the Podesta emails, I figured out,\u201d he said.Corsi said Monday that he has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation since receiving a subpoena in late August. He said he gave investigators two computers, a cell phone and access to his email accounts and tweets.But he said talks with investigators recently had \u201cblown up.\u201d\u201cI fully anticipate that in the next few days, I will be indicted by Mueller,\u201d he said, as he made a pitch for donations to his legal defense fund.Stone, who has also said he expects to be indicted, has denied being a conduit for WikiLeaks, which published thousands of emails stolen from Podesta in the weeks before the election.In a telephone interview with the AP last month, Stone said: \u201cI had no advanced notice of the source or content or the exact timing of the release of the WikiLeaks disclosures.\u201d"}
