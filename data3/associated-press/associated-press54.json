(Sean D. Elliot/The Day via AP)\n            MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) \u2014 The three major candidates for Connecticut governor gave their closing arguments to the voters Tuesday in what has become a tight race.While Republican businessman Bob Stefanowski doubled-down on his call to reduce or phase out state taxes to jump start the economy, Democratic businessman reminded voters that he would \u201cfight for Connecticut values, not Trump values,\u201d referring to the GOP president.Meanwhile, petitioning independent candidate Oz Greibel repeated his call for voters to reject the \u201cduopoly\u201d of the two-party system and vote for a team that will provide \u201creal leadership\u201d for a state facing massive fiscal challenges.Tuesday\u2019s debate at Foxwoods Resort Casino, sponsored by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, the Hartford Courant and WTNH-News 8, marked the final matchup before Election Day. It comes as a new Quinnipiac University Poll shows the race between Lamont and Stefanowski is very close.Here are some new issues the candidates addressed:___GUNS AND POLICE RELATIONSA question about how to improve police and community relations in Connecticut\u2019s cities evolved into a debate over guns, school safety and leadership in the wake of tragedies like the deadly synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh and the Newtown school shooting.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything we can in terms of protecting our real serious gun laws coming after Sandy Hook. Bob has talked about taking them back, revoking them. That\u2019s the exact wrong thing to do,\u201d said Lamont, who has stepped up such accusations against Stefanowski, who has received an A-rating from the NRA.While Stefanowski ignored the accusation during the debate, he reiterated to reporters afterward there that was \u201cno chance\u201d a repeal bill would reach the governor\u2019s desk. He repeated his calls to step up security in Connecticut\u2019s schools and his criticism of a prisoner release program.Griebel, meanwhile, argued that setting an example of tolerance for the rest of the state is critical to addressing violence, racial issues and acts of violence, adding how \u201cit\u2019s more than just guns.\u201d___VOTING RECORDIt took a question about early voting for Stefanowski\u2019s lack of voting to come up.Asked if they supported legislation that would allow Connecticut voters to cast their ballots before Election Day, all three either supported the idea or agreed to consider it.\u201cAnything to increase the participation rate would be good,\u201d said Stefanowski, who did not vote for 16 years, including in the 2016 presidential election.That prompted Griebel to quip: \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad Bob feels strongly about voting given his track record.\u201dLamont voiced concern that he\u2019s heard complaints from people around the state who don\u2019t believe their vote makes a difference. He said he wants to \u201cget this negative tone out of the body politic,\u201d give people something to believe in and convince them how their vote matters.\u201cIf the election of Donald Trump doesn\u2019t remind you, elections make a difference,\u201d he said.___DEATH WITH DIGNITYTaxes, jobs and the state\u2019s economy have dominated the gubernatorial debates so far. For the first time, the three candidates were asked whether they\u2019d sign legislation that that would allow people with less than six months to live to obtain a prescription allowing them to end their lives.Both Lamont and Stefanowski appeared open to the idea, speaking about the recent deaths of their parents.\u201cI loved them to death. I was with them every chance I could. But I think they knew when they were ready to go,\u201d said Lamont, who said he\u2019d consider such legislation, including legal safeguards. \u201cIt\u2019s an intensely personal decision that each and every family has to do.\u201dStefanowski spoke of his mother who recently died after suffering for two years from dementia.\u201cI talked to my dad about it and he said, \u2018for better or for worse, I want your mother home,\u2019\u201d Stefanowski said. \u201cI would tend to leave it up to the family, I think it\u2019s a very personal decision that each family should make.\u201dGreibel said he didn\u2019t disagree with his rivals, saying he\u2019d want to understand the legal safeguards.\u201cBut the concept of letting individuals rather than the government make decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m fairly supportive of that concept.\u201d"}
