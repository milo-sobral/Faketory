{"id": "Flags, injuries, bad \u2018D\u2019 hurt Skins in 38-14 loss to Falcons", "paragraph": "LANDOVER, Md. (AP) \u2014 As harbingers go, this was quite a start for the Washington Redskins.After a 4-yard run on the opening play of the game, the hosts\u2019 initial possession featured a holding penalty, a sack for a loss of 9 yards, an injured left knee for left guard Shawn Lauvao \u2014 who was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair \u2014 and a three-and-out punt.Washington\u2019s following drive also ended in a punt, but not before Alex Smith threw a ball that hit a Falcons defender\u2019s helmet, receiver Josh Doctson dropped a pair of passes, and right tackle Morgan Moses limped off with an injured right knee, although he later returned.Nothing really went right for the mistake-prone Redskins on Sunday in a 38-14 loss to Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and the Atlanta Falcons that ended the three-game winning streak that put Washington atop the NFC East.\u201cIt was a bad game, but it was one game,\u201d Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen again.\u201dA Skins defense that came in ranked No. 2 in the NFL against the run and No. 4 overall turned in a real clunker.Atlanta gained 154 yards on the ground, averaging 6.4 per carry. Worth noting: The Falcons last ran for more than 100 in Week 2.\u201cCaught us with our pants down and hit us in the mouth,\u201d Washington cornerback Josh Norman said.There were several other issues for the Redskins.At one point in the second quarter, Atlanta was outgaining Washington 229-41.The Falcons were 8 for 8 on third-down conversions before halftime.Washington finished with 10 penalties for 147 yards, and some players thought the officiating was to blame.\u201cMight as well just give them the ball,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said, \u201cand give them the game.\u201dAtlanta (4-4) began the third quarter with an eight-play drive that finished with Ryan\u2019s third of four TD passes for the afternoon \u2014 a 10-yarder to running back Tevin Coleman \u2014 that boosted its advantage to 28-7.Washington then punted after its possession was derailed by penalties: one for taunting on Doctson, another for unsporstmanlike conduct on Moses, and a holding call on Pro Bowl right guard Brandon Scherff (who soon exited with a hurt left shoulder, joining starters Lauvao and left tackle Trent Williams, who had thumb surgery last week, on the sideline).Atlanta put together touchdown drives that covered 86, 81 and 75 yards in the first half, then another 75-yarder to begin the second. A Redskins secondary that added starting safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix in a trade-deadline deal Tuesday \u2014 there was quite a bit of hand-gesturing by safety D.J. Swearinger before snaps \u2014 gave up first-half TD passes by Ryan of 39 yards to Coleman and 40 yards to Calvin Ridley.The capper was a 35-yarder in the fourth quarter to Jones, who dragged Clinton-Dix a bit at the end of the play for his first scoring catch in nearly a year.The Redskins have thrived on offense with 33-year-old running back Adrian Peterson carrying the load. But he only ran nine times for a measly 17 yards through the opening two quarters, when Washington\u2019s best gain was 22 on a scramble by quarterback Alex Smith.Nearly sacked, Smith spun out of a defender\u2019s arms and turned it into a run up the sideline ending with a pop from Atlanta\u2019s Brian Poole that was so big it drew an \u201cOhhhhh!\u201d from spectators. It helped extend an 11-play, 80-yard drive that finished with Smith\u2019s 2-yard fade pass to Doctson for a TD that cut Washington\u2019s deficit to 14-7 late in the opening half.Doctson \u27a1\ufe0f the \ud83c\udfe0#ATLvsWAS | #HTTR pic.twitter.com/hhFgbQlZVgThe Redskins finally score on a fade route, a rare highlight for the NFC East leaders on a day nothing went right.That was just about it in terms of highlights for the Redskins.\u201cGot to be better,\u201d Swearinger said. \u201cGot to be disciplined.\u201d___Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
