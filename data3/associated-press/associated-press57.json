She was 56.Gates died in Honolulu on Thursday, the University of Hawaii said Tuesday. The researcher, also the president of the International Society for Reef Studies, was diagnosed with brain cancer in May and had been on medical leave since.Gates became known globally for her idea to speed up coral evolution and create more resilient reefs.The Associated Press first wrote about her project to breed \u201dsuper coral \u201d in 2015. Her goal was to develop coral that could withstand the devastating effects of climate change. Her work was featured in the 2017 Netflix documentary \u201cChasing Coral.\u201dWarmer ocean temperatures can cause corals to go through a process known as bleaching, where the animals become weak and sick. Repeated bleaching events can lead to coral death and the loss of entire reef ecosystems.Gates\u2019 colleague and partner in the assisted evolution project, professor Madeleine van Oppen of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said Gates was \u201ca great inspiration\u201d to many.\u201cShe was intelligent, professional and had a wonderful sense of humour,\u201d Van Oppen told the AP in an email. \u201cShe was a great ambassador for the reef and a role model for women in coral reef science.\u201dVan Oppen said it\u2019s a shame she will not be able to see the long-term impacts of their research. \u201cBut I will work extra hard to try and make it a success in her honour,\u201d she said.Gates was known for her innovative science, but she was also widely admired for her welcoming, energetic and cheerful personality.\u201cRuth was not only a shining star in coral research, but an indomitable spirit in every aspect of life,\u201d said Judy Lemus, interim director the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology and friend of Gates. \u201cHer enthusiasm was contagious, and she absolutely loved what she did. Her loss will be felt deeply within our own community and throughout the broader research community.\u201dMark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program, said Gates\u2019 death is a loss for the entire scientific community.\u201cRuth was really a force of nature, I mean she was just an amazingly productive scientist, one of the brightest, most inquisitive minds that we had in the whole field of coral reef science. Her energy was boundless,\u201d Eakin said in a phone interview.Gates faced a \u201cwhole suite of criticisms\u201d over her plan to breed stronger corals, but \u201crather than dismissing those criticisms, she would embrace them\u201d Eakin said. \u201cShe is the kind of great leader who has trained so many and left a legacy of students who will be able to pick up and continue this work.\u201dMariana Rocha de Souza, a doctoral student in Gates\u2019 lab, said in an email to the AP that her mentor was an advocate for women in science.\u201cWe are a very gender balanced lab and she encouraged us as PhD students to do the same when selecting the professors in our committee. She motivated us, women in science by telling her experience and encouraging us to fight,\u201d Rocha de Souza said.Gates\u2019 research won the support of philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, allowing her to expand, develop and test her theories in a lab on Oahu\u2019s Coconut Island.\u201cRuth Gates realized before most others that for corals to survive climate change, their adaptation to warming waters will have to be assisted,\u201d said Lauren Kickham, director of product management at Paul G. Allen Philanthropies. \u201cShe believed in their resilience and ultimately offered hope for the future.\u201d Allen, 65, died Oct. 15 from complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.Gates was born in Akrotiri, Cyprus, in 1962 and is survived by her wife, Robin Burton-Gates, and her brother, Tim Gates.___Follow AP Hawaii Correspondent on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CalebAP___This story has been corrected to show the release date of the documentary \u201cChasing Coral\u201d was 2017, not 2018."}
