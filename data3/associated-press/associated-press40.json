(AP) \u2014 Senate candidate Martha McSally hammered down on her promises to strengthen border security and crack down on immigrants who commit crimes as she faces criticism over her position on health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.With a week until Election Day, McSally held a news conference Tuesday in Mesa to publicize her endorsements from three members of \u201cangel families\u201d \u2014 people who lost loved ones at the hands of immigrants living in the United States illegally.She also said the caravan of Central American migrants in Mexico headed to the United States is awakening Americans to the dangers at the border. \u201cThis caravan just shows the insanity of the border crisis that\u2019s happening everyday single day here in Arizona,\u201d McSally said.McSally, a Republican, faces Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the race to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake. McSally has recently been accused of using the migrant caravan to divert attention away from her views on coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d McSally said of the criticism. \u201cEvery single day, everywhere I go, people are asking me about the caravan. Every single day, they are asking about what we are doing to secure our border.\u201dThe Sinema campaign released a statement saying Sinema has a strong record on border security, including supporting an increase in the penalties on immigrant smugglers and helping get more customs officers at Arizona\u2019s ports of entry.Despite McSally\u2019s current claims that she supports coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, her vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act did in fact weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The bill would have let states permit insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions more for health insurance. It narrowly passed the House on a party-line vote but was never voted on in the Senate.McSally has shifted to the right on immigration, helping draft a bill last year that would have sharply cut legal immigration. She also signed onto another bill that would have let young immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d to stay in the country, but was loaded with so many new regulations on them and other limits on immigration that the Dreamers themselves, all Democrats \u2014 including Sinema \u2014 and many Republicans opposed it.Steve Ronnebeck, whose 21-year-old son Grant was fatally shot in 2015 at a convenience store in Mesa by a man who was in the country illegally, said he was endorsing McSally because the migrants in the caravan shouldn\u2019t be allowed to cross into the United States.Authorities say Ronnebeck\u2019s son, who was working as a clerk at the store, was killed by Apolinar Altamirano, a 33-year-old Mexican man who was in the United States illegally and is awaiting trial on a murder charge in Grant Ronnebeck\u2019s death.Altamirano is accused of fatally shooting Ronnebeck after the store clerk insisted that Altamirano pay for a pack of cigarettes. Authorities say Altamirano then stepped over Ronnebeck to get several packs of cigarettes before leaving the store.\u201cThese are stories that are all too normal at this point,\u201d Steve Ronnebeck said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to call them normal, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s getting to be \u2014 normal.\u201dAltamirano has already been sentenced to six years in prison for his earlier guilty pleas in the case to misconduct involving weapons. He still faces murder, robbery and other charges in Ronnebeck\u2019s death. He has pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges.___Associated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.___Follow Jacques Billeaud at www.twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud"}
