(AP Photo/Richard Rodriguez, File)\n            ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jason Witten vividly remembers Tony Romo\u2019s return to the home of the Dallas Cowboys for the first time as a broadcaster last year after retiring as the storied franchise\u2019s all-time passing leader.Now it\u2019s the 15-year tight end\u2019s turn.Witten\u2019s move from the field to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d booth was a little more sudden and surprising than Romo\u2019s decision to join CBS after he had lost his job to Dak Prescott.The club\u2019s career leader in catches and games was still a starter when he left, and probably a little more beloved than his best friend and former quarterback. The fans figure to illustrate as much when the Cowboys (3-4) host the pro team from Witten\u2019s home state, the Tennessee Titans (3-4), on Monday night.\u201cIt will certainly be emotional for me,\u201d Witten said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be after 15 years and so many relationships inside that building with fans and teammates and management and coaches and all that stuff?\u201dUnlike Romo, Witten had a ceremony to say goodbye in the spring after he had already started his offseason training at the team\u2019s facility. The announcement days before his 36th birthday came after the realization that it would be difficult for Witten turn down a chance to be one of the NFL\u2019s lead analysts.Also unlike Romo, Witten\u2019s transition has been rough. He\u2019s been criticized more than Romo, who was an instant hit by showing the ability to predict plays and has shown more an ability to connect with viewers.The most notable moment for Witten so far came when he slipped and said Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers had pulled \u201canother rabbit out of his head\u201d with a tying touchdown pass late in a 33-30 overtime win against San Francisco.\u201cI would never walk into something like that and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to be on this level from minute one,\u2019\u201d Witten said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be perfect but I think over time if you listen, you win them over by saying, \u2018Man, the guy is sharing a lot of football with us that we didn\u2019t necessarily know.\u2019\u201cI believe in myself. I believe I\u2019ll be good at it.\u201dWitten will have a friendly audience at AT&T Stadium, regardless of whether people are watching from their devices in the stands.\u201cHis leadership in the locker room and the practice field throughout games was off the charts and a great example for all of us how to go about your job,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cA rare guy, a special guy we are all fortunate to have been around.\u201dThe obvious question is whether Witten will hesitate to criticize Prescott, or Garrett, or any of the tight ends trying to replace him. Prescott thinks so.\u201cI expect Witten to be critical,\u201d said Prescott, who had Witten for his first two years in the league, both as the Dallas starter. \u201cI tell the story about when I first came in, how tough he was on me then. So now I don\u2019t expect it to be any different.\u201dWitten kept his composure during his 15-minute retirement speech in May at team headquarters, about 35 miles from the stadium. It should be pretty easy to do the same when he\u2019s shown from the booth, mostly likely after a tribute video on the giant screen that hangs above the field.\u201cI think that\u2019s why when I made the decision back in May, why I put so much time into it, was because I knew once I did I wasn\u2019t going to allow myself or was going to try really hard not to get to the emotions of it all,\u201d Witten said. \u201cWill it be different? Absolutely. Will be it be awkward going into that stadium? Of course it will be.\u201dJust as it was for Romo a year ago.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
