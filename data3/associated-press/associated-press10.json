(AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\n            LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 A bucket of sports drink having been just poured over his head, Scott Frost wrapped up a quick television interview near midfield and started sprinting off the field at Memorial Stadium.Moments after the clock hit zeroes on a 53-28 victory over Minnesota Saturday, it was time for him to soak it all in.As he ran through the end zone and entered the tunnel, Frost took off his cap and held it high to thank the fans who had waited seven games for the native son who won so many times as a player on this field to pick up his first win as coach.\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it to be in October,\u201d Frost said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got as good a fans as there are in the country. They\u2019re loyal. They\u2019re supportive. Our kids appreciate it them. They\u2019re fighting hard for them. Yeah, I almost teared up running off the field. That was a special moment.\u201dA week after squandering a late 10-point lead at Northwestern and losing in overtime, the Huskers (1-6, 1-4 Big Ten) scored on three of their first four possessions on their way to a 28-0 lead.Minnesota (3-4, 0-4) made things interesting, though, scoring on three possessions in a row spanning the halves, with backup quarterback Tanner Morgan replacing Zack Annexstad to open the third quarter and leading two straight touchdown drives to pull the Gophers to 28-22.\u201cThat\u2019s how this whole year has been. We\u2019re going to have to play well for four quarters,\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better every day. We\u2019re still not so good we can sleep on a lead or not play our best. So proud of this team. They could have quit a long time ago. They could have shut it down. This team every week does more of what we ask them, does it better, keeps getting better. That was a pretty good show out there today.\u201dBarrett Pickering kicked a field goal between Adrian Martinez\u2019s TD passes of 35 and 67 yards to Stanley Morgan Jr. to break things open again, and as the 365th home consecutive sellout crowd started sensing the end of the program-record 10-game losing streak, a chorus of \u201cGo Big Red\u201d chants began.Nebraska rushed for 383 yards and totaled 659. Devine Ozigbo ran for 152 yards, Martinez for 125 and Maurice Washington for 109.Martinez completed 25 of 29 passes adding up to 276 yards and three TDs. Stanley Morgan caught 10 balls for 163 yards, both career highs.Tanner Morgan was 11 of 16 for 214 yards and Annexstad 9 of 20 for 135. Gophers coach P.J. Fleck said Annextad had to leave the game because of an internal injury in his midsection. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\u201cCongratulations to Coach Frost,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, everybody remembers your first. This team should be 5-1 or 4-2.  We didn\u2019t stop them tonight at all. We didn\u2019t tackle well. We didn\u2019t set an edge.\u201dTHE TAKEAWAYMinnesota: A quarterback controversy could be coming, if Annexstad is healthy enough to play next week. Tanner Morgan gave the Gophers a spark. The Minnesota defense had no answer for Martinez and Co., though.Nebraska: The defense\u2019s depth issue continues to show up in second halves. The Huskers seemed to tire for the second straight week. This team is much like Frost\u2019s teams at Central  Florida. It\u2019s all about the offense.HOLD OFF ON THE GATORADEFrost said his Gatorade shower was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d hinting that such high jinx should be reserved for championships.\u201cFirst of all, it was cold. I took it like a man,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it coming, but I\u2019m glad the guys are so excited. They deserve to be excited. There\u2019s going to be a day around here where we aren\u2019t celebrating one win, and we\u2019ll keep working toward it.\u201dCREATIVE PLAY CALLSFrost, who calls the offensive plays, dialed up two Statue of Liberty plays, with Washington gaining 17 yards on the first. He also had Washington throw a halfback pass, but the ball fell short of tight end Austin Allen.The Gophers used a flea-flicker on their second drive of the second half, with Tanner Morgan connecting with tight end Seth Green for 31 yards before Green took a snap out of the wildcat formation and ran in from 4 yards to cut it to 28-22.IBRAHIM HELD IN CHECKThe Gophers were without running back Shannon Brooks, who was arrested last weekend on suspicion of misdemeanor assault for an altercation with his male roommate. Brooks, who was medically cleared to play after rehabbing an offseason knee injury, didn\u2019t make the trip.Mohamed Ibrahim, who ran for 157 yards against Ohio State on Oct. 13, was limited to 49 yards on 18 carries.UP NEXTMinnesota hosts Indiana on Oct. 26.Nebraska hosts Bethune-Cookman on Oct. 27.___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
