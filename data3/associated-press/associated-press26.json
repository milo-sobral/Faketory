(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n            MOSINEE, Wis. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump decried the threat of political violence and called on the media to end its \u201chostility\u201d on Wednesday, hours after authorities intercepted bombs sent to a news network and prominent Democrats who have been the targets of some of his sharpest barbs.Trump\u2019s pleas for harmony came as law enforcement officials scrambled to find the perpetrator of the thwarted bomb attacks against former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN and others. The scripted message was a dissonant one for the president, who has repeatedly blasted his political opponents as criminals and argued that they will destroy the country if they win control of Congress in the midterms.\u201cWe want all sides to come together in peace and harmony,\u201d he said at a campaign rally in Wisconsin. \u201cAny acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.\u201dThe president noted the unusually subdued tone of his remarks.\u201cBy the way, do you see how nice I\u2019m behaving tonight?\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever seen this?\u201dLaw enforcement authorities have ascribed no motive to the crime. Still, it has prompted immediate debate over whether increasingly personal and hard-edged rhetoric has contributed to a potentially dangerous political climate. Trump critics have blamed him for the tone.The president did not take any responsibility.Those \u201cengaged in the political arena\u201d must \u201cstop treating political opponents as being morally defective,\u201d he said. He also referenced high-profile incidents in which conservatives have been accosted in restaurants and public spaces by political critics.He added: \u201cThe media also has a responsibly to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories.\u201dTrump has frequently labeled stories he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfake news\u201d and many reporters as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d He has also denounced his political enemies in deeply personal terms and even described those who tried to thwart his second Supreme Court nominee as \u201cevil.\u201dTrump spoke to thousands of supporters in a central Wisconsin rally as he looked to boost struggling Republican candidates less than two weeks out from the midterm elections. He visited the tiny city of Mosinee, which has a population of 4,000. He won that part of the state by double digits in 2016.Republicans in the state have been growing increasingly nervous about the prospects of holding onto the governor\u2019s office, held by Scott Walker, let alone state Sen. Leah Vukmir\u2019s chances of picking up a U.S. Senate seat held by a well-positioned Democratic incumbent.Mindful of the news, Trump refrained from delivering some of the most pointed riffs of his regular routine, including steering clear of two of his favorite targets: Clinton and California Rep. Maxine Waters, whose office appears to have been a target of one of the mail explosives.Trump also skipped his usual litany of insults against his potential 2020 rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, whom he often jokes he would be able to easily beat in a fistfight.But he had harsh words for Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, branding her Vukmir\u2019s \u201cradical far-left opponent\u201d who \u201cwants a socialist takeover of health care.\u201d\u201cYou know I\u2019m trying to say that very nicely,\u201d he told the crowd with a smile. \u201cNormally I\u2019d scream, \u2018They want a socialist takeover!\u2019\u201d he said, mimicking his own bellicose delivery. \u201cNow I say, \u2018Wants a socialist takeover,\u2019\u201d he said, feigning a professorial tone. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be nice.\u201dAnd even though Trump refrained from mentioning Clinton, his crowd couldn\u2019t resist. They burst into a \u201cLock her up!\u201d chant during the preshow before he arrived.___Colvin reported from Washington."}
