Two others already have been shuttered.WeWork is in the process of purchasing the Manhattan building with financial partners for a reported $850 million.The building was designated a historic landmark in 2007 by the city\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission that must approve the new designs, upon the recommendation of the community board committee.The rooftop of the nearly 700,000-square-foot building will feature a translucent, glass courtyard to be used as a private space for employees, while restoring and preserving the historic exterior of the building occupied by Lord & Taylor since 1914.The project was presented Tuesday by the team of chief architect Bjarke Ingels.The aim is to keep the basement, first and second floors as retail space open to the public during business hours. No tenant has yet been announced.The historic bay windows will be restored to their original, bigger size, and the Fifth Avenue entrance will be expanded to make it wheelchair accessible, while retaining the original Lord & Taylor emblems.Inside, the sixth floor balconies will be restored.Granit Gjonbalaj, WeWork\u2019s chief development officer, called the project \u201can opportunity to honor our home city\u2019s rich history, while also building toward the future by revitalizing this iconic space as a heartbeat of culture, commerce and innovation.\u201d"}
