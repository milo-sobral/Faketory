(AP) \u2014 Snapping the ball was a challenge Sunday for the New York Jets, and things didn\u2019t get any better after that.Center Spencer Long reinjured a finger and had half-dozen off-target shotgun hikes, which compounded problems for quarterback Sam Darnold. He threw four interceptions \u2014 including a pick-six after he snared a high snap \u2014 and the Jets never reached the end zone in a 13-6 loss to the Miami Dolphins.\u201cWe need to be more consistent, myself included especially,\u201d Long said. The injury on the middle finger of his right hand, which he dealt with earlier this season, finally forced him from the game.Darnold stayed in to take more rookie lumps for the Jets (3-6). His most costly mistake was a pass toward the sideline intended for tight end Eric Tomlinson. Linebacker Jerome Baker cut in front for his first career interception and scored the game\u2019s only touchdown untouched.\u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to get it over him,\u201d Darnold said.As for the inconsistent snaps, he said: \u201cIt disrupts timing, but there\u2019s no excuse for how I played out there.\u201dBaker\u2019s score put Miami ahead 13-3 with 11 minutes left. Darnold threw two more interceptions in the final 2\u00bd minutes, both on fourth-and-long.Darnold finished 21 for 39 for 229 yards with four sacks and a passer rating of 31.8. That\u2019s the third time he has been below 40.\u201cI just have to be sharper,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I have to have a better plan when I get to the line of scrimmage. I\u2019ve got to know exactly where to go with the ball. If No. 1 or 2 isn\u2019t there, I have to go to (No.) 3.\u201dCoach Todd Bowles said he\u2019s not thinking about replacing Darnold with veteran Josh McCown.\u201cNot right now, no,\u201d Bowles said.His critique of Darnold\u2019s performance: \u201cThere are plays he would like to have back.\u201dInterceptions aren\u2019t a new problem \u2014 Darnold came into the game tied for the NFL lead with 10 . And lack of scoring is a familiar issue, too \u2014 the Jets have 33 points in the past three games, all losses.Safety Jamal Adams called the latest defeat a 53-man effort but added, \u201cIt\u2019s the same, same, same stuff. It\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019m not going to hold my tongue for anything anymore. Enough is enough. I\u2019m not a loser.\u201dDespite a day of sputtering offense, the Jets had chances to pull the game out.Trailing 6-3, they reached the Miami 20 early in the fourth quarter, but a sack and delay of game penalty forced them back, and Jason Myers missed a 50-yard field goal try.\u201cWe were in it until the end,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t make enough plays to win it.\u201d___Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
