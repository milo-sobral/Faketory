Minnesota was playing in the Mavericks\u2019 first home game.The Timberwolves had a tough travel schedule to start the season, with two trips to Texas in a span of three days. They lost the season opener at San Antonio before beating the Cavaliers at home.Butler\u2019s trade request became public about a week before the start of training camp, and the four-time All-Star didn\u2019t start participating in on-court workouts with the team until a raucous appearance a week ago.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}
