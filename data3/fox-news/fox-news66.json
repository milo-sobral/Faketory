The most recent IOM findings, as of the beginning of October, listed 28,500 missing migrants.While the AP\u2019s tally found an additional 28,300 unaccounted for, the report acknowledged its numbers were still low.\u201cMore bodies of migrants lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAnd families don\u2019t always report loved ones as missing because they migrated illegally, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\u201dINTERNATIONAL RED CROSS FEARS FOR CITY IN SYRIA IT CAN'T REACH WITH AIDThis year in Africa alone, more than 1,700 people died in the seas that separate Africa and Europe. And, since 2014, within the African continent itself, more than 18,400 migrants are believed to have died. This includes over 4,300 unnamed bodies in just one South African province. The IOM also asserted that many more likely disappear without a trace \u2013 perishing in the vast plains of the Sahara Desert.Moreover, at least 3,861 migrants are presumed to have died en route between Mexico and the United States since 2014.YAZIDIS SEEK RESCUE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENSLAVED, MARRIED OFF TO ISISThe report highlights that many of the missing \u2013 or pronounced dead \u2013 are children. Some 2,773 minors have been reported to the Red Cross as disappeared on the journey to Europe, with an additional 2,097 adults reported missing by children.The AP report also indicated that that funding for projects to adequately track migration and its costs has waned, meaning that many will likely never be found or identified.The Associated Press contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
