(Reuters)\n          Katie Brennan spent more than a year trying to get authorities to take action against the man she accuses of sexually assaulting her. Finally, she emailed New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.Ms. Brennan, chief of staff at the state\u2019s housing agency and a former volunteer for the governor\u2019s campaign, first called the police in April 2017, one day, she said, after a campaign staffer allegedly forced himself on her. After months of investigation, the county prosecutor\u2019s office declined to file charges against her alleged attacker, saying it didn\u2019t think a jury would convict him. She turned to state law enforcement and high-ranking members of the Murphy administration.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing changed.Finally, the 31-year-old Jersey City resident, who said she turned down a $15,000 settlement offer from her alleged assailant if she signed a nondisclosure agreement, emailed Mr. Murphy and first lady Tammy Murphy directly.She didn\u2019t explicitly mention the alleged assault in her June 2018 email, but asked to speak with the governor or his wife about a \u201csensitive matter\u201d that had happened during the campaign. The governor responded within the hour and said he was looping in staff to arrange a time.\u201cHang in,\u201d the governor wrote to Ms. Brennan in the email, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe are on it.\u201dA meeting with the governor was never scheduled. And months later, the accused, Albert J. Alvarez, was still working for the state, as chief of staff at the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. Mr. Alvarez resigned his position Oct. 2, the same day The Journal emailed him for comment.\u201cAt each turn, I\u2019ve just felt so disappointed,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in an interview. \u201cI tried everything. And none of it worked. If I can\u2019t get any justice, I just don\u2019t seriously know who can.\u201dMr. Alvarez\u2019s attorney, John Hogan, said his client \u201cabsolutely, positively denies these allegations of sexual assault.\u201d He declined to comment further on any aspect of Ms. Brennan\u2019s account. Neither Mr. Alvarez nor his attorney responded to additional attempts to reach them by phone or to an email with detailed questions.After his resignation, Mr. Alvarez\u00a0was named\u00a0in\u00a0local\u00a0and\u00a0national press reports\u00a0about the allegation. Ms. Brennan spoke publicly about the alleged assault for the first time for this article.New Jersey Republicans have called for an investigation into Mr. Alvarez\u2019s hiring, and the state Senate\u2019s Democratic leadership said in a statement they were disturbed by the allegations.Earlier this month, Murphy\u2019s spokesman said his office received a separate accusation on Thursday against Alvarez. The accusation, which was referred to the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office, concerned an incident that allegedly occurred in 1999 or 2000, the spokesman said. Neither Mr. Alvarez nor his attorney responded to a request for comment on the allegation.For all the attention given to allegations of sexual assault in recent months, they remain difficult for the criminal-justice system.\u00a0Such crimes often produce no conclusive evidence, making them hard to investigate and prosecute. Conflicting accounts can be the only material officials have to work with. Prosecutors tend to decline to pursue cases deemed unlikely to win a conviction.That can leave accusers feeling they are denied justice. The accused, meanwhile, can still experience life-altering impacts from the allegations alone, including a damaged career and stained reputation.Criminal-justice officials are now considering new ideas about how to handle such cases. More than a dozen states have passed legislation in the past two years aimed at improving the handling and testing of rape kits, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Proposals to broaden the legal definition of sex crimes, and to lengthen or eliminate the statute of limitations for sexual assault have passed or are pending in legislatures across the country.New\u00a0training programs for police and prosecutors\u00a0working on assault cases also are being rolled out, including in Alaska and Illinois.The governor\u2019s spokesman said the Murphys didn\u2019t find out that Ms. Brennan had accused Mr. Alvarez of sexual assault until the first week of October, when The Journal contacted the administration for comment. In a joint statement, Gov. Murphy and Ms. Murphy said they had asked the director of the Statewide Division of Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action to review how the state handles allegations of sexual misconduct.\u201cWe are confident that this allegation was handled appropriately by the administration and that policies and procedures were properly and promptly followed. However, it is clear that the process during the transition was inconsistent with our values, and the hire should not have happened,\u201d the Murphys said. \u201cWe must now ask: how can we hold ourselves to a higher standard moving forward?\u201dThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
