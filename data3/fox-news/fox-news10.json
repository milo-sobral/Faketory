Warren)If North Dakota residents vote to next month to legalize recreational marijuana, women in the state could be able to purchase an unusual item that\u2019s said relieve menstrual-related pain: cannabis-infused inserts.A company called Foria, which makes cannabis-infused inserts, or vaginal suppositories, could sell the product in the state if the measure passes, KVLY-TV reported. One Park River resident, Stephanie Carlson, told the new station she\u2019d be willing to try the product, noting that she'd be the \u201cfirst in line\u201d to purchase it.OBITUARY FOR MOM WHO BATTLED DRUG ADDICTION GOES VIRAL\u201cI just want to be able to have that one week a month to not be hunkered down in pain. I want to be functional,\" Carlson said.Foria, which, according to KVLY-News, already sells its products in states such as Colorado and California where recreational marijuana has been legalized,\u00a0says on its website that the vaginal suppositories are \u201cspecifically formulated for relief from menstrual discomfort.\u201dThe product, called \u201cForia Relief,\u201d \u201cdelivers the soothing benefits of full-spectrum cannabis directly to the area that needs it most \u2014 typically with little or no psychoactive effects,\u201d the company added.The vaginal suppositories are made with 60mg of THC and 10\u00a0of CBD. When smoked or ingested, the former cannabinoid gives you a \u201chigh\u201d effect, while the latter, another cannabinoid found in marijuana, does not have any psychoactive effects.When inserted, the compounds \u201cactivate certain cannabinoid receptors in the pelvic region,\u201d Foria says on its website, adding the \u201ccannabinoids directly impact the immune system and the nerve endings of the uterus, cervix, ovaries and surrounding smooth muscle tissues,\u201d to assuage the pain.The company claims most users \u201cdo not report experiencing a psychoactive high when taking Foria Relief vaginally or rectally,\u201d but noted those who use the product will test positive for cannabis during a drug screening.Some user claim they experienced relief from cramping and other menstrual-related side effects in about eight minutes, Women\u2019s Day reported in 2016. OPIOID CRISIS IS MAJOR MIDTERM ISSUE IN AREAS HARD HIT BY DRUG DEATHS\"On a monthly basis, I'm dealing with not just one day of pain, two days of pain. It can be anywhere between five and ten days of extreme pain,\" Carlson told the news station.\"If legalization were to happen, women like her, women like me, women like you, everybody, all women can have this option to not be in pain,\u201d she added.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
