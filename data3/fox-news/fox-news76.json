The Post said the reporter played an audio recording of the actor's threat to the New York City Police Department.Baldwin reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ALEC BALDWIN CHARGED WITH ASSAULT AFTER ALLEGEDLY PUNCHING MAN DURING PARKING SPOT SPATPalmieri was reacting to a tweet by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman who presented her Twitter followers with her personal bad-boy Baldwin story.\u201cBaldwin was the first person I ever experienced being blocked by on Twitter, after he used his account with hundreds of thousands of followers to berate me for... writing about a fundraiser he\u2019d hosted in a way he didn\u2019t find satisfactory,\u201d Haberman said.The Post reported in 2013 that Palmieri\u2019s run-in with Baldwin came after she was on a stakeout and tried to question him about a lawsuit that had been filed against his wife.Baldwin admitted to making the comments but claimed that they weren't meant to be taken seriously, the Daily Mail reported.'SNL' STAR JOKES ABOUT CANDIDATE WHO LOST EYE IN AFGHANISTANBaldwin, 60, was accused of slamming his fist against the jaw of a man who swooped in and took a parking spot in the West Village that was being held for the actor last week.Hours after his release from police custody, Baldwin denied assaulting anyone.\u201cNormally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today\u2019s story,\" he said. \"However, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much. I realize that it has become a sport to tag people (with) as many negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment.\"This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
