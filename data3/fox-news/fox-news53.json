Hours later, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon drew the ire of Majority Whip Steve Scalise\u00a0by declaring that Democrats don\u2019t kill people, completing a 24-hour span being labeled CNN\u2019s \u201cnew low\u201d by critics.CNN has preached a call for civility since its New York headquarters was evacuated when a pipe bomb was found in the mailroom last week but critics feel the network only cares about hate speech when it comes from the right. This theory came to a head when controversial GQ Magazine columnist Julia Ioffe was on Tapper's show, \u201cThe Lead,\u201d on Monday during a heated debate about hateful rhetoric.\u201cI think this president, one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did,\u201d Ioffe said.Tapper did not chime in, but David Urban, the panel\u2019s token conservative, didn\u2019t appreciate the remark.Ioffe was continuing her rant about Trump's \u201cradicalized\u201d supporters when Urban interrupted.\u201cJake, for you not to push back on that is irresponsible. That\u2019s irresponsible. For her to say the President of the United States has radicalized more people than ISIS is irresponsible,\u201d Urban said.Tapper said, \u201cOK, you disagree with it,\u201d as other panelists talked over each other and Ioffe stood by her claim.A CNN spokeswoman said Tuesday evening: \u201cCNN has diverse panels of guests with a variety of views and obviously no anchor, including Jake Tapper, agrees with everything each one says. Julia Ioffe\u2019s comments were regrettable and we\u2019re glad she apologized.\u201dNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that the lack of pushback was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\u201cCNN is not interested in unifying this country because they'd rather bring on guests like Ioffe to sow further division and create split screens between the President and protesters as he visits the synagogue,\u201d Houck said.Ioffe offered a brief apology later in the show, chalking her comment up to exaggerating during \u201can emotional and personal painful time\u201d and she was booked for another appearance on CNN a few hours later.The widely-condemned comment was not the first time that Ioffe has come under fire for outlandish rhetoric aimed at Trump. She was fired from Politico in 2016 for an obscene tweet in which she implied that Trump was having an incestuous relationship with his elder\u00a0daughter, Ivanka.\u201cCNN invited on one of the most poisonous voices on the left. Someone who routinely trades in baseless conspiracy theories and ad hominem attacks,\u201d conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News. \u201cThe results were predictable. Jake Tapper sat by while she spewed truly repulsive rhetoric completely unmoored from reality. CNN rewarded her for this abhorrent behavior with an invitation to appear on yet another show on their network. A new low for CNN.\u201dJake Tapper sat by while she spewed truly repulsive rhetoric completely unmoored from reality. CNN rewarded her for this abhorrent behavior with an invitation to appear on yet another show on their network. A new low for CNN.\"Despite outrage across social media, CNN invited Ioffe back on the network during primetime, when\u00a0she made another batch of disturbing comments. During a conversation about anti-Semitism and racism on \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d with Don Lemon, Ioffe declared that Trump supporters condone heated rhetoric turning into hate.\u201cYou can\u2019t overestimate the power of the bully pulpit\u00a0of a president. The things he says, and the things he doesn\u2019t say and the ways in which he says them. The way in which he condemns racist, when you can see it\u2019s so half-hearted. It\u2019s like a kid being forced to do something,\u201d Ioffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the freaks\u2026 it\u2019s also, kind of, the silent majority of Trump supporters that think this is OK, that continue to support this president despite what he said.\u201dLemon \u2013 unlike his colleague earlier in the day \u2013 questioned the comment, asking \u201cYou think it\u2019s a silent majority?\u201d\u201cYeah, I think that,\u201d Ioffe responded.Ioffe then essentially said Trump supporters overlook hateful rhetoric in exchange for tax cuts as Lemon told her she \u201chit the nail on the head.\u201d\u201cIf they don\u2019t support it ...\u00a0the silent majority, they enable it,\u201d Lemon said.On the same episode of \u201cCNN Tonight,\u201d Lemon also caught the attention of Congressman\u00a0Steve Scalise, R-LA, during a conversation about recent tragedies that have plagued America.\u201cThe right-wing group killed a woman in Charlottesville. This guy is a right-winger who killed the people in the synagogue. The right-winger sent bombs to CNN and to Democrats. I don\u2019t see Democrats killing people,\u201d Lemon said.Conservative commentator\u00a0Mike Shields, who was a guest, quickly reminded Lemon that \u201cthey tried to.\u201dScalise \u2013 who survived an assassination attempt while practicing for a baseball game with fellow GOP lawmakers \u2013 made it clear on Twitter that he heard the comment and responded with a simple emoji of eyes watching and his spokesperson offered a statement condemning the remark.\u201cSteve Scalise was nearly assassinated by a leftist who came to a baseball field with the specific intention of murdering several Republican members of Congress. While that reality may be inconvenient for the narrative Don Lemon is trying to push, the fact remains that Democrats do in fact have an issue with political violence that cannot be ignored or swept under the rug.\"\u201cSteve Scalise was nearly assassinated by a leftist who came to a baseball field with the specific intention of murdering several Republican members of Congress.
