In Varela\u2019s room, he said Noceda snorted Percocet and also ingested liquid marijuana, court documents stated. Tests later showed she had taken a fatal mix of fentanyl and alprazolam, a generic name for Xanax.Varela told detectives the woman collapsed within a minute of mixing the two. Authorities said Varela never sought help for Noceda and instead sent semi-nude photos of her to friends and texting \u201cLOL, I think she od\u2019d, still breathing.\u201d\u201cBro you killed her,\u201d a friend responded to him, according to the Daily Herald.\n      Alyssa Noceda, 18, died in February 2018.\n      Varela played an online game until he fell asleep, waking up in the morning to find Noceda\u2019s lips blue, court documents said.He continued his day by going to work at Dairy Queen and his co-worker contacted police in the following days after Varela said he didn\u2019t know if Noceda was still alive when he was having sex with her. Court records say he told a friend that \u201cshe died having sex with me\u201d and that he was having sex with her \u201cto pass the time.\u201dVarela was arrested later that day after executing a search warrant and finding Noceda\u2019s body stuffed in a plastic crate at the suspect\u2019s home. He told investigators he planned to bury Noceda with onions to mask the smell, police said. He also told detectives that after Noceda died, he used her thumb to unlock her phone Feb. 4 and send messages to make it appear she had run away.WASHINGTON POLICE CHIEF SAYS HE WON\u2019T ENFORCE STRICTER GUN LAWS THAT \u2018INFRINGE\u2019 ON CITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTSIn court Thursday, Varela said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my foolish actions. Whatever I get is what I deserve.\u201dNoceda\u2019s mother, Gina Pierson, told Q13 Fox she was heartbroken over the sentencing.\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cShe deserves justice and she\u2019s not receiving it.\u201dShe said she hoped lawmakers would examine the case and consider changing the laws in the state.\u201cI\u2019m just appalled. It\u2019s a joke. A slap on the wrist for taking someone\u2019s life and violating another human being,\u201d she said.Fox News\u2019 Paulina Dedaj and the Associated Press contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
