Crittenden on Saturday announced the certification of election results from the disputed midterm elections, and, as anticipated, Republican Brian Kemp was the top vote-getter\u00a0in the governor's race, besting\u00a0Democratic competitor Stacey Abrams.With 100 percent of precincts tallied,\u00a0the state's official election website showed Kemp with 50.22% of voters, or 1,978,408 votes. Abrams, by comparison, had 48.83 percent, or 1,923,685.Libertarian candidate Ted Metz had .095 percent of voters, or 37,235 votes, the website showed.\"After\u00a0receipt of certified election results from all county election superintendents, the Secretary of State has tabulated, computed, canvassed, and certified the votes cast for all federal and state officers and questions voted for by voters of more than one county,\" the announcement said.Georgia, like Florida and Arizona, among others states, saw tensions flare and challenges bloom after the Nov. 6 midterms, amid claims of inaccurate counting, voter suppression and other irregularities. But Abrams acknowledged Friday that she could not defeat Kemp.Still,\u00a0she vowed to pursue a federal lawsuit challenging the \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of the state\u2019s elections. While describing a variety of issues at the polls, Abrams said\u00a0that\u00a0\"the state failed its voters.\"\"I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election. But to watch an elected official \u2013 who claims to represent the people in\u00a0this state, baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people\u2019s democratic right to vote \u2013 has been truly appalling,\" Abrams said. \"So let's be clear, this is not a speech of concession.\"Fox News' Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
