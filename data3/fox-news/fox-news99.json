The president paid tribute earlier in the day to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in the so-called \"war to end all wars.\"\"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery's white crosses, holding a black umbrella.On Saturday, Trump was criticized for failing to visit a second American cemetery about 60 miles outside of Paris because bad weather grounded the helicopter he planned to take.\u00a0A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place.Vice President Mike Pence did not attend Sunday's Veterans Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery, where Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie represented the administration.
