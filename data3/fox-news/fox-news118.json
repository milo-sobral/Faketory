HOW A HOMELESS MAN, NEW JERSEY COUPLE'S ALLEGED FAKE SOB STORY UNFOLDED\u201cMr. D\u2019Amico knew that I was a very kind person and that I was a bit naive,\u201d McClure added. \u201cMr. D\u2019Amico took advantage of that.\u201dBoth McClure, 28, and D\u2019Amico, 39, claimed in a viral GoFundMe post in 2017 that Bobbitt, who was homeless, gave his last $20 to McClure so she could\u00a0get gas when stranded in Philadelphia last November. To thank him, McClure and D'Amico created a GoFundMe account to raise funds for Bobbitt. Around 14,000 people donated to the campaign, which brought in more than $400,000 overall.But earlier this week, a New Jersey prosecutor\u00a0--\u00a0 who said an\u00a0investigation began after Bobbitt claimed he wasn't getting the money that had been raised on his behalf and later sued the couple -- said\u00a0the feel-good tale was a complete lie.\"The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,\" Burlington County prosecutor Scott Coffina said. \"It was fictitious and illegal, and there are consequences.\u201dMcClure didn't run out of gas and Bobbitt didn't spot her in trouble and give her money, Coffina said.Investigators said the three deliberately prevented donors from gaining information \"that would affect their judgment about solicited contribution to that fundraising effort,\" NBC 10 reported.Now, both McClure and D\u2019Amico and the homeless man are facing charges for allegedly concocting the fake story that led to a $400,000 profit.Bobbitt, 35, was arrested Wednesday night by U.S. Marshals in Philadelphia and remained in custody Thursday on probation detainers and a $50,000 bond. D'Amico and McClure surrendered to authorities Wednesday night and were released.COUPLE'S GOFUNDME CAMPAIGN FOR HOMELESS MAN WAS A FAKE: PROSECUTORSAll were charged with theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception.
