Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who faces a stiff challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun, Obama said the vote on Tuesday is for the character of the nation.\u201cAmerica is at a crossroads,\u201d Obama said in Gary, which is just across the state line from Chicago. \u201cIn two days, you get to vote in what I believe will be the most important election of our lifetimes. I know politicians always say that, but this time it\u2019s really true.\u201dHe noted that creating civil rights for Americans, better health care and workers\u2019 wages \u2014 and also preventing them from being rolled back happens with actions at the polls.He said Democrats are responsible for progress and Republicans like to be reactionary to that progress for a better nation. \u201cWhen you vote, you can be a check on bad behavior,\u201d Obama said.Obama repeated his attack on the Trump administration, but never mentioning the sitting president\u2019s name, as he\u2019s often done on the campaign trail this season.\u201cSociety doesn\u2019t work unless words have meaning and consequences,\u201d Obama said, as The Indianapolis Star reported. \u201cAnd the only check right now on the behavior of these Republicans is you and your vote.\u201dObama ended his speech paralleling his mantra of hope and change: \u201cChange is gonna happen. Hope is gonna happen. With each new step we take, hope will spread. Goodness will spread. And you will be the ones who will have done it. It starts with you. Let\u2019s go vote. Let\u2019s go make change. Let\u2019s go make hope.\u201dDemocrats are counting on wresting control of the House from Republicans and hoping for a longshot series of wins to take back the Senate as well. But Republicans are optimistic they can gain seats in a Senate map heavy on red states and haven\u2019t given up on holding the House.For Donnelly, who frequently touts how often he votes with Trump, the Obama rally is a little more complicated.Donnelly has angered some Democrats by tacking to the right in recent weeks and embracing some of Trump\u2019s pet priorities, such as building a border wall with Mexico.CLICK FOR COMPLETE FOX NEWS 2018 MIDTERMS COVERAGEObama, on the other hand, has proven a polarizing figure with independent and Republican voters and is credited with some of Indiana\u2019s rightward political shift, even though he won the state in 2008.To win in Tuesday\u2019s election, Donnelly not only needs high turnout from his party\u2019s base but also must peel off some moderate Republicans and independents.Trump was keenly aware of Obama\u2019s upcoming visit, which he mentioned Friday during an event at an Indianapolis-area high school.\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\u201d Trump said as the crowd jeered in the conservative Midwestern state. He later added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to the Obama days.\u201dThe former president also campaigned in his hometown of Chicago for businessman J.B. Pritzker, Democrats\u2019 nominee for Illinois governor in his race against Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who came into office an outsider promising responsibly spending, lower taxes and clean government. It\u2019s been a battle of wealthy titans spending their way through potentially the costliest gubernatorial campaign in U.S. history. The tough-talking Rauner\u00a0finds himself in danger of becoming only the third Illinois governor since 1900 \u2014 after Democrat Edward Dunne in 1916 and Republican Richard Ogilvie in 1972 \u2014 to serve one four-year term but lose re-election. Only two incumbents have lost by more than 10 percentage points since the 19th century \u2014 in 1948 and 1960.WILL IMMIGRATION MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR GOP AT THE POLLS?Stumping for Pritzker, the 53-year-old billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune,\u00a0Obama questioned the present reality of the American spirit, and asked the rallygoers to mobilize to the polls. \u201cWe are in this together, and we rise and fall as one nation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGoodness and decency are still out there, kindness is still out there, generosity is still out there, hope is still out there, we just have to stand up and speak for it.He said there is a contest of ideas presently about what America is now and what the nation is going to be, and he said to choose hope over fear, and that regular Americans can check the privileged who may use their power and rhetoric to divide with ballots cast for the Democratic Party, who always have to clean up the mess that Republicans make in office. \u201cThey\u2019ve racked up enough indictments to field a football team. No one in my administration got indicted,\u201d he said about the Trump administration.Obama said progress in America is summed up with: \u201cOrdinary people did extraordinary things.\u201dThe Associated Press contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
