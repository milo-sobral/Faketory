It was said to have been preceded by \u201ca brawl and a physical altercation\u201d that erupted after \u201cdiscussions between citizen Jamal Khashoggi and those who met him while he was in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s attorney general said in a statement, according to The Wall Street Journal.State media also quoted prosecutors as saying 18 Saudi nationals were\u00a0being held on suspicion of being involved in the Washington Post columnist's death.Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both cast doubt on the findings, with Warren urging President Trump to react accordingly and not push \"their propaganda.\"\u201cSaudi Arabia has had 2 weeks to get its story straight about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and \u2018a fistfight that led to his death\u2019 was the best they could do?\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201c@realDonaldTrump should be holding the Saudis accountable \u2013 not pushing their propaganda.\u201dJAMAL KHASHOGGI, MISSING ACTIVIST AND WRITER, KILLED IN FIGHT, SAUDI STATE MEDIA REPORTSSchiff also took to social media, tweeting that \u201cthe claim\u201d was \u201cnot at all credible.\u201d He added that if Khashoggi \u201cwas fighting with those sent to capture or kill him, it was for his life.\u201cThe Kingdom must be held to account. If Administration doesn\u2019t lead, Congress must,\u201d he continued.The president, who addressed Khashoggi\u2019s death Friday while attending a roundtable in Arizona, said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s announcement of arrests was a \u201cgood first step,\u201d and that he planned to collaborate with Congress on what the U.S. response should be.When a reporter asked whether he believed the details of Khashoggi\u2019s death to be credible, Trump replied: \u201cI do. I do.\u201d He added that he wanted to speak with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before making any decisions.\u201cSaudi Arabia has been a great ally, but what happened is unacceptable,\u201d Trump said. Regarding the arrests, he said, \u201cIt's a big first step. It's only a first step, but it's a big first step.\u201dCONGRESS FACES TOUGH CHOICES ON SAUDI ARABIA IN WAKE OF KHASHOGGI KILLINGRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also offered\u00a0an impassioned response to the Khashoggi news, tweeting that to describe him as being \u201cskeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement.\"\u201cFirst we were told Mr. Khashoggi supposedly left the consulate and there was blanket denial of any Saudi involvement.\u00a0Now, a fight breaks out and he\u2019s killed in the consulate, all without knowledge of Crown Prince,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find this latest \u2018explanation\u2019 as credible.\u201dGraham has made earlier fiery statements on Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance as well, saying on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that he wanted to see the crown prince, who he described as being \u201ctoxic,\u201d forced out of his position.\u201cThis guy has got to go,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSaudi Arabia, if you\u2019re listening: There are a lot of good people you can choose, but MBS has tainted your country and tainted himself.\u201dKhashoggi had written critically about Mohammed bin Salman for The Washington Post.CASTRO SLAMMED FOR \u2018SLANDEROUS\u2019 LIE AFTER SUGGESTING KUSHNER MAY HAVE ORCHESTRATED KHASHOGGI MURDERSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., echoed other lawmakers' doubts about the fistfight scenario, saying that \u201cthe so-called \u2018explanation\u2019 from the Saudis is not even close to credible.\u201d\"What they did was unacceptable and I call on my colleagues in Congress to join me in denouncing their behavior and changing how we treat them,\u201d he tweeted.Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., also issued a statement on Twitter, saying \u201cIf ever a story reeked of a coverup, it is this one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s taken nearly three weeks for the Saudis to even admit that an American resident and journalist died in the Saudis\u2019 own consulate. And throughout this ordeal, the only urgency apparent in our President\u2019s handling of this crisis has been a compulsion to buy time for the Saudis to construct a story to protect the royal family,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe American people need and deserve to know what the White House and our intelligence professionals know. Our country must not be complicit in this coverup.\u201dRepublican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted that details surrounding Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance have varied over time, and he urged Trump\u2019s administration to decide on its\u00a0own who should be held responsible.Fox News\u2019 Matt Richardson, Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
