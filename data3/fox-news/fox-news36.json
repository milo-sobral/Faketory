That amount of sodium that makes meatless burgers \u201csaltier than a portion of salt and vinegar crisps,\u201d the researchers wrote in the study.The group also concluded two meatless items (Tofurky\u2019s Deli Slices Hickory Smoked and Tesco\u2019s Meat Free 8 Bacon Style Rashers) \u201ccontain much more salt per 100g than seawater,\u201d adding these two items were the \u201csaltiest products in the survey.\u201dOf all the items surveyed, only three products were considered to be low in salt, containing 0.3g per 100g of salt or less, while roughly 18 percent of the products studied \u201chave no portion size, making it hard for consumers to judge how much of a product they should eat and gauge their daily salt intake,\u201d according to the study.Excessive sodium can lead to a variety of health issues, such as high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke and kidney disease, among others, according to the American Heart Association.The U.S. Food & Drug Administration recommends consuming 2,300 mg (roughly one teaspoon) of sodium or less a day, while the United Kingdom\u2019s Food Standards Agency, which monitors food safety across the country, recommends children who are 11 years or older should not exceed 6g of salt each day.\u201cThe food industry [has] ensured greater availability of meat-free alternatives, but now they must do more to ensure that meat-free alternatives contain far less salt - at the very least lower than their meat equivalents,\u201d Action on Salt nutritionist Mhairi Brown said in a statement.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSGraham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Salt, echoed Brown's advice.\u201cReducing salt is the most cost-effective measure to reduce the number of people dying or suffering from entirely unnecessary strokes and heart disease. Given the vast amounts of strokes and heart disease that could be avoided and huge savings to the NHS, it is incomprehensible that Public Health England are not doing more to reduce the amount of salt in our food. We are AGAIN calling on PHE to take urgent action,\" MacGregor said in a statement.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
