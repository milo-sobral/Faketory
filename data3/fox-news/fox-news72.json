Since I declared my candidacy in April 2017, they\u2019ve been nervous. And it shows right now. Nancy Pelosi has spent well over half-a-million dollars in the last week to try and distort my campaign,\u201d the Republican nominee in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District said Saturday.\u00a0 While Pelosi might not actually be losing sleep over Edwards\u2019 candidacy, his race does represent somewhat of a wild card among the dozens of competitive House contests being held Tuesday. It\u2019s one of the precious few Democrat-held seats Republicans have a chance at flipping, from blue to red. Those open races include battles for Minnesota's 8th District seat, held by a retiring Democratic incumbent; Minnesota's 1st, where incumbent Democrat Tim Walz is running for governor; and Nevada's 3rd, where incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen is running for Senate. Minnesota's 8th, where Republican Pete Stauber faces Democrat Joe Radinovich, is considered perhaps the GOP's best shot to swipe a seat, but a strong performance in the others would give the party at least a chance to defy the odds and hold the chamber. Democrats are well aware of the New Hampshire race\u2019s significance among these; in accusing Pelosi of distorting his record, Edwards was referring to a new TV ad by the House Majority PAC, the top outside group that supports Democrats running in congressional elections and is closely tied to House Minority Leader Pelosi.\u00a0\u00a0 In the final week of the New Hampshire campaign, the group shelled out nearly $700,000 to run a TV commercial targeting Edwards on the issue of health care. \u201cWashington is attacking our health care and Eddie Edwards can\u2019t wait to join the assault,\u201d the narrator warns in the spot.The day after the ad hit the airwaves, an Emerson College poll\u00a0put Edwards just 2 points behind Democratic nominee Chris Pappas, a three-term member of New Hampshire\u2019s Executive Council. Pappas\u2019 advantage was within the survey\u2019s sampling error. Two previous polls showed the Democrat with larger single-digit leads.\u201cWe\u2019ve run this whole campaign like we\u2019re a few votes behind,\u201d Pappas told Fox News.Minutes earlier, speaking to party activists at a canvass kickoff in Manchester, Pappas told the crowd, \u201cThis is a district that is going to help determine what Congress looks like going forward. Whether we\u2019re going to have checks and balances going forward in D.C.\u201dFor the first time in 16 years, no incumbent is running for re-election for the seat, which has ping-ponged between Democratic and GOP control the past four elections. Sitting Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter is retiring. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few quintessential swing districts in the country,\u201d noted Colin Reed, a GOP strategist who ran former Sen. Scott Brown\u2019s 2014 Senate campaign in New Hampshire.The Democrat-held district also is one of a handful nationwide that President Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. That\u2019s why Republicans hope the seat can flip from blue to red as they mostly play defense elsewhere in hopes of holding their House majority. A potential pick-up here could be a key factor in whether the party can stave off the kind of Democratic takeover Pelosi, who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel, envisions.Two days before voters head to the polls, Democrats are still widely seen as having the edge in the race for House control. The Real Clear Politics map, Fox News' Power Rankings and other race raters all show Pelosi's party better-positioned going into Tuesday.'It\u2019s one of the few quintessential swing districts in the country.'\u201cWe\u2019re going to be asked ten or twenty years from now what we were doing in 2018 when our country needed us. We have to be able to answer that question. We have to be able to [say] we knocked on every door that we could, we made every phone call that we could,\u201d said Pappas, who if elected would be New Hampshire\u2019s first gay member of Congress.If Edwards wins on Tuesday, he would also make history, as the state\u2019s first black member of Congress. The conservative candidate is a U.S. Navy veteran and former police chief of a small town who also served as the state liquor commission\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.Edwards was joined Saturday morning at his jam-packed campaign headquarters by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.\u201cThose Republicans that were winning are winning by a little more. Those Republicans that were down are now leading by a little bit. The surge is here. It really is,\u201d Sununu touted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because we spend all this outside money on television ads and that kind of stuff. It\u2019s this. It\u2019s the grassroots support.\u201dSununu was referring to that House Majority PAC ad, which also alleges:\u00a0\u201cEdwards supports a disastrous health care plan that would strip protections for pre-existing conditions, increasing the costs of your premiums and prescriptions.\u201dEdwards argued the commercial was \u201cfull of lies and distortions.\u201dHe added he\u2019s \u201ctalking about lowering the costs of health care in this country, I talked about pre-existing conditions and protecting pre-existing conditions.\u201dReed said the commercial\u2019s a sign Democrats are concerned about holding the seat.\u201cLook at the money. And the fact that outside third-party groups decided to spend on behalf of Pappas in the last ten days of the election, when resources are the most precious, that tells you this thing is tightening,\u201d he explained.While House Majority PAC spent big bucks to help Pappas, neither the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) nor the Congressional Leadership Fund \u2013 the major outside group backing GOP House candidates \u2013 reciprocated.Reed said that Republicans \u201care defending an incredibly large swath of territory and resources get limited. That\u2019s just a reality of life.\u201dBut he pointed to a silver lining for the GOP candidate: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst thing in the world for Eddie Edwards to not be having the outside groups being in New Hampshire on his behalf because it allows him to bolster an independent image.\u201dPappas also enjoys a sizeable campaign cash advantage over Edwards, telling Fox News, \u201cWe have a significant capacity advantage over the other side to be able to talk to voters, to be able\u00a0to\u00a0knock on doors and make phone calls.\u201dEdwards said he wasn\u2019t concerned with the lack of last-minute outside help.\u201cThis is New Hampshire. This is all about grassroots, this is all about knocking on doors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all about retail politics. That\u2019s what Granite Staters appreciate the most. And that can overcome dollars at any level.\u201dThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.
