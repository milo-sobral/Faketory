Make it count. Mr. Senator Mike Espy!\u201dThe roomful of Mississippians tapped their feet along to the raspy sounds of the local, live band \u2013 before greeting Democrat Mike Espy, a candidate for U.S. Senate in the Magnolia State.Espy is vying for one of two Senate seats up for election in Mississippi. If elected, the former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture would not only be the first Democratic senator the state\u2019s seen in nearly 40 years, but also the first African American to hold the seat since the late 1800s.While the odds are stacked against him, analysts warn Republicans not to overlook Espy in the crowded special election.Two Democrats and two Republicans aim to replace longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who resigned in April.A recent poll from NBC shows the \u201cjungle\u201d primary will likely lead to a runoff between Espy and incumbent\u00a0Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who was nominated to replace Cochran by Gov. Phil Bryant.The poll put State Sen. Chris McDaniel, a conservative firebrand, in third and political newcomer Tobey Bartee, a Democrat, last.Dallas Breen, director of the Stennis Institute of Government, told Fox News the most crucial thing in this midterm is voter turnout, which Breen said could allow Espy to create cracks in the Republican stronghold of Mississippi.\u201cHe\u2019s going to win because people like me and everyone else in here are going to get people to go out and vote,\u201d veteran Eugene Horowitz said at a catfish fry campaign event, while sitting next to his wife.\u201cI think he\u2019ll be able to win because the people are uniting for inclusiveness,\u201d Patricia Horowitz told Fox News over the live blues music.The largely African American crowd cheered after Espy spoke about bettering health care and reaching across the aisle in the nation\u2019s capital.With a 38 percent African American population, the state\u2019s forecasted high turnout could bode well for Espy \u2013 who hopes to garner the same enthusiasm black voters showed President Obama in 2008 and 2012. But Espy promised he\u2019s reaching across race and party lines.\u201cI can\u2019t just win with black votes alone,\u201d Espy said. \u201cI have to win with all votes, white votes, black votes, doesn\u2019t matter to me. Votes are votes.\u201dStanding in his way may be the current Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the first woman in the Magnolia State to hold the seat.\u00a0 She hopes President Trump\u2019s endorsement will drive Republicans to the ballot box but acknowledges the race will likely lead to a run-off, since she appears to be splitting votes with McDaniel in recent polls.\u201cWe are not flat-footed, we\u2019re looking ahead because we have vision, we can see what the potential is and what the concerns are,\u201d Hyde-Smith told Fox News. \u201cWe will be ready for the runoff.\u201d\n      Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith addresses the crowd at the state's annual hobnob event hosted by the Mississippi Economic Council.\n      (Fox News)Some experts suggest the outcome of the race will come down to who rubs more elbows with everyday voters \u2013 that\u2019s because with three candidates significantly polling, each ballot is about more than who you\u2019re voting for, it\u2019s also about who you\u2019re voting against.\u201cThe raw numbers of people who come out to vote \u2013 regardless of party identification - those people will have more of an impact on their candidate,\u201d Breen said.But McDaniel, a conservative firebrand who gave away an AR-15 rifle at a recent campaign event, laughed at the idea of the Deep South sending anyone but a Republican to Washington, D.C. \u2013 calling even Hyde-Smith too liberal.\u201cThis is a Republican state, and it\u2019s going stay a Republican state,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cAnybody who says otherwise doesn\u2019t know this state very well.\u201dEspy disagreed.\u00a0He pointed to Sen. Doug Jones\u2019 victory in Alabama\u2019s special election last year \u2013 and he said he is\u00a0using the fellow Democrat\u2019s campaign as a guide for his own.CLICK FOR COMPLETE FOX NEWS MIDTERMS COVERAGE\u201c[Anytime something takes] place next door, so to speak it, it always opens that question of - well, if it happened there, can it happen here?\u201d Breen asked.However, unlike in Alabama\u2019s case, where Republican contender Roy Moore faced allegations of sexual misconduct, Hyde-Smith has largely\u00a0been without controversy. As a result, Breen said, Democrats in Mississippi aren\u2019t driven to polls with the same force.Hyde-Smith\u2019s steepest criticism draws from her past as a Democrat, switching parties in 2010.Her leading opponent, Espy, is also taking heat. He was indicted in 1997 for receiving improper gifts while agriculture secretary \u2013 though eventually acquitted of all charges.Should the pair make it to a runoff, Breen said Espy has one potential saving grace: voter apathy.The underdog has a chance to switch the narrative, Breen said, \u201cif [one party has a] strong core base that says, \u2018I\u2019m going to vote for this candidate and if he or she doesn\u2019t win the [jungle] primary, I\u2019m not going to vote.\u2019\u201dMIDTERMS' BIGGEST CAMPAIGN CONTROVERSIESHe suggested that could be the case for McDaniel\u2019s base.\u201cWhat I believe 20 years ago is still what I believe today,\u201d McDaniel supporter, Marc Cotham, told Fox News. This is why, he added, he probably wouldn\u2019t cast a ballot at all if the race went to a runoff between Hyde-Smith and Espy, suspicious of Hyde-Smith\u2019s history as a Democrat.Across the table, another voter agreed, saying she would opt to write-in a candidate because Hyde-Smith is \u201cwishy washy.\u201d\n      McDaniel poses with a supporter, who won the raffle for an AR-15 rifle ahead of Mississippi's special election.\n      (Fox News)But these voters appeared to be in the minority at a McDaniel campaign event Thursday. Many admitted they would vote for Hyde-Smith if there was a runoff between the incumbent and Espy, which means Espy\u2019s steep climb to a victory will become even steeper.While unlikely, Mississippi\u2019s special election could potentially be the key to whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate \u2013 a determination that may have to wait until after Thanksgiving if one candidate does not earn a majority of the vote on Nov. 6 in the Magnolia State.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even speculate what those three weeks would look like in the state if that were the case,\u201d Breen smiled. \u201cIt would definitely be a first in my time on this earth to see something like that [in Mississippi].\u201dThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
