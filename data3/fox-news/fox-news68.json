At some point, Alec Price bumped into Bowman, investigators said.Later, Bowman's friend, Terrell Goodman, confronted the Price brothers about the accidental bump, according to prosecutors.\n      Alec Price died in October 2017 after \"accidentally bumping into\" two men at a Georgia bar.\u00a0\n      (Facebook)Goodman and Bowman left the bar, but upon their return, a security guard noticed Bowman had a gun in his pocket. That security officer then escorted the two out.Prosecutors said the two men waited outside for the Price brothers to exit the bar \u2014 and when they did, \"Bowman fired four shots with a 9mm handgun at the two men.\" Three of the shots hit Alec \u2014 one of which struck his heart, killing him. Bowman and Goodman then fled the scene.Just over an hour later, Bowman was stopped for allegedly running a red light, and the two men were arrested for unrelated warrants and taken to jail.GANG-RELATED GUNFIRE THAT KILLED GIRL, 11, WAS AIMED AT WRONG HOUSE, POLICE SAYFour days later, while still in jail, Goodman apparently bragged to another inmate that he and Bowman had \"got into it with some guys\" at the bar \u2014 and eventually admitted he killed Price.Investigators determined that the gun used to kill Price was also used to commit an armed robbery and aggravated assault during a separate incident a week earlier. The victim in that event identified Bowman \u2014 who allegedly \"used his hands and feet to brutally beat and kick the man\" \u2014 in a photo lineup, which led to investigators linking Bowman and Goodman to Price's death.Bowman, who had previously been arrested 15 times, was convicted of murder, felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, among other charges. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 15 years. Goodman has yet to stand trial.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC.
