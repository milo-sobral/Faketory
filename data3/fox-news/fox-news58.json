The group was using a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with a camera to study an undersea mountain called the Davidson Seamount, located within the boundaries of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, when they saw hundreds of octopuses on the ocean floor.\u201cWe went down the eastern flank of this small hill, and that\u2019s when \u2014 boom \u2014 we just started seeing pockets of dozens here, dozens there, dozens everywhere,\u201d\u00a0Chad King, chief scientist on the Nautilus, recently told National Geographic of the Oct. 23 discovery.Most of the octopuses were in brooding positions, with their arms turned inside out to protect\u00a0their egg clusters.\n      Scientists aboard the research vessel\u00a0E/V Nautilus discovered a cluster of octopuses off the coast of California on Oct. 23, 2018.\n      (\u00a0Ocean Exploration Trust/NOAA)GIANT GROUP OF OCTOPUS 'MOMS' DISCOVERED OFF COAST OF COSTA RICA: 'IT'S SUICIDE'\"Clusters of octopus were positioned near shimmering fluid seeps, which were previously unknown to occur in this region,\" Ocean Exploration Trust explained in a statement to Fox News. \"Other species were observed to be associated with the fluid seeps including whelks, anemones, and shrimp.\"The location of where the\u00a0cephalopods appeared to be gathering intrigued\u00a0researchers, who believe they may have been crowding around warm spots in the ocean. However, Ocean Exploration Trust notes its underwater vehicle was not equipped with any devices that would be able to accurately collect information on the water temperature. It would be quite unusual if they did, indeed, decide to swarm around warmer waters.\"We went down the eastern flank of this small hill, and that\u2019s when \u2014 boom \u2014 we just started seeing pockets of dozens here, dozens there, dozens everywhere.\"\"Exposure to higher temperatures jump-starts their metabolism, making them need more oxygen than the warm water can provide,\" Chicago's Field Museum previously explained in a blog post.\u00a0\"All in all, not a great place to start an octopus family.\"At least 1,000 octopuses were documented during the 35-hour expedition, the non-profit confirmed.'PEA-SIZED' BABY OCTOPUSES DISCOVERED ON FLOATING TRASH IN HAWAII\u201cOut of that 1,000, we might have seen two or three octopuses that were just swimming around,\u201d King described to National Geographic, estimating at least 99 percent were brooding.\n      More than 1,000 octopuses were documented near the\u00a0Davidson Seamount, located about 80 miles southwest of Monterey, Calif.\n      (\u00a0Ocean Exploration Trust/NOAA)The rare\u00a0discovery comes roughly six months after\u00a0researchers in Costa Rica found a group of 100 octopuses while exploring the\u00a0Dorado Outcrop, a rocky area of the ocean floor created by an underwater volcano, with a drone.\u201cWhen I first saw the photos, I was like \u2018No, they shouldn\u2019t be there! Not that deep and not that many of them,\u201d Janet Voight, associate curator of zoology at Chicago's Field Museum and an author of a new study on the findings published in \"Deep Sea Research Part I,\"\u00a0said in\u00a0April.The\u00a0\"dinner-plate-sized\"\u00a0octopuses \u2014 a never-before-seen species of the genus Muusoctopus \u2014 were gathering around cracks in the outcrop, where warm liquids are released.\u201cThe focus of [our] expeditions to Dorado Outcrop was to study a cool hydrothermal system. In doing so, we discovered this fascinating congregation of brooding octopuses,\u201d Geoff Wheat, a geochemist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said in a statement. \u201cThis is only the third hydrothermal system of its type that has been sampled, yet millions of similar environments exist in the deep sea. What other remarkable discoveries are waiting for us?\u201dThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.
