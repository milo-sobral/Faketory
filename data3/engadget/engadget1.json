The 9to5Google team has sifted through the Google search app's code to discover an unannounced \"Lists and Notes\" web app for Assistant that lets you jot down important information to sync across devices.  It's extremely basic (you can't do much more than add titles), but there's a degree of polish that suggests it's not just an experiment.It's not clear if or when Google might put this app into service.  Any such move might leave people scratching their head -- if you already use Google Keep or Google Tasks, why switch to this?
