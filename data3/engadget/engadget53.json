Google, however, has a simple solution: create your own emoji.  It's expanding Gboard's Minis with stickers that recreate your face in a range of emoji-style expressions.  If you dye your hair, pierce your nose or wear a stylish hat, you can share that look when you send someone a \"hug\" or \"yum.\"The creation process remains the same.  Gboard takes a selfie and uses machine learning to set facial traits (skin color, hair and accessories), and gives you an opportunity to customize the look, including details like glasses and freckles.  Consider it a simpler, less platform-specific version of Apple's Memoji or Samsung's AR Emoji.The emoji Minis are available worldwide in both the Android and iOS versions of Gboard, regardless of language.  They're not as universal as official emoji, but they might come close enough if you're looking to add a personal touch.Jon has been hooked on tech ever since he tried a Compaq PC clone when he was five.\u00a0He's big on mobile and is one of those precious few people who wears his smartwatch with pride.\u00a0He's also an unapologetic Canadian: Don't be surprised if you get an earful about poutine or the headaches with Canadian carriers.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
