It's launching a Rewards program in December for \"select\" passengers.  The more you travel, the more points you'll get toward bonuses like ride upgrades and more experienced drivers.  There will also be double-points days to encourage you to head out.More people will have access in 2019, Lyft said.  It also vowed to listen to rider input and tweak the program.This isn't Lyft's first rewards effor,t strictly speaking.  You can already earn Delta SkyMiles, and workers can use Business Rewards to earn credit for personal trips.  This could have a more tangible impact for many people, however.  If you're the sort who frequently uses Lyft but can't justify an All-Access plan, this could keep you loyal when you'd otherwise be tempted to try Uber or another competing service.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
