Now, though, it's having a change of heart.  SpaceX has scrapped plans to make the rocket's second stage reusable.  Instead, Elon Musk said, it's focused on \"accelerating\" development of the BFR.  Musk also teased a significant design shake-up, calling it \"delightfully counterintuitive\" and a \"radical change\" compared to the previous design.Musk didn't say when he expected the BFR to be ready in the wake of the strategy shake-up.  In March, SpaceX aimed for early orbital launches by 2020.It's not completely surprising that SpaceX might shift focus.  The company's ultimate aim is to retire Falcon 9 in a few years once the BFR is ready.  It would be pouring resources into a rocket whose shelf life could be quite limited by the time it's truly reusable.  BFR, meanwhile, represents SpaceX's long-term future.  What the spaceflight firm loses in near-term cost-cutting and waste reduction could be worthwhile if it speeds up the arrival of a long-term solution.Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
