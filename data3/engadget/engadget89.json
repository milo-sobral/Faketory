The movie follows the basic thread of the game, with young Tim meeting a Pikachu he can actually understand as they embark on a quest to find Tim's dad. To say the live-action movie has a different feel than the 3DS/2DS title would be an understatement, though. The creators have gone for a \"realistic\" look for Pok\u00e9mon, and you're probably going to find it either very appropriate or decidedly weird.The movie does show some promise. Ryan Reynolds seems well-suited as Detective Pikachu, keeping that gruff, cynical (but family-friendly) tone from the game. And it's not trying too hard to be clever or cute. There's no guarantee the full movie will be exciting when it arrives in 2019, but what's here suggests it might be more enjoyable than some video game adaptations -- certainly better than the legendarily bad Super Mario Bros. movie.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
