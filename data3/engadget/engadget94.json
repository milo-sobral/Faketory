Winter solstice celebrations apparently swap Christmas carols for pagan carols and instead of holiday-themed rhymes or tales, witches tell ghost stories. Plus, like mortal holidays, those of witches also tend to bring guests and visitors, though they're not always welcome.You can see glimpses of the episode in Netflix's holiday preview video below. In one clip, Aunt Hilda tells Sabrina that they're going to watch her favorite Christmas movie, and in another we see the Spellmans enjoying a warm drink by the fire. Check out the video below to see what else Netflix has lined up for the season.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
