Company chief Elon Musk has revealed on Twitter that he's just walked the full length of the \"disturbingly long\" tunnel and that it's on track for its December 10th opening party. He previously promised an opening event for that night followed by free rides for the public the next day. Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.The company's tunnels will have Loop shuttles that can carry pedestrians, cyclists and even private vehicles at speeds reaching 150mph. Boring's goal is to offer people rides on those shuttles for as little as $1 in an effort to alleviate traffic problems in big cities.Musk is known for being a bit too optimistic when it comes to his companies' timelines, so some people were understandably skeptical that Boring would be able to stick to its target date. If everything goes well, we might see a glimpse of the firm's vision in a few weeks.You can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
