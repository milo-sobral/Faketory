{"id": "\n\nEngadget\n\n\nYouTube might come to Nintendo Switch on November 8th", "paragraph": "You haven't had many options for streaming video on the Switch. There's Niconico in Japan, Hulu... and, well, that's about it. Another option might be right around the bend, however. In the wake of hints from this spring, people searching Nintendo's website for games have received suggestions for a Switch-native YouTube app that would be available November 8th. You can't currently visit a product page for it, but the listing by itself speaks volumes.An imminent app release certainly wouldn't be out of the question. Google is still determined to make YouTube near-ubiquitous, and Nintendo is no stranger to YouTube apps on systems like the 3DS and Wii U. Wouldn't it only make sense to release the app on a touchscreen console that's practically made for it?Still, it could be huge news for the Switch if the listing is accurate. The device has never really been an honest-to-goodness media player for many people, but that might change with YouTube on tap. And while many people already have YouTube on phones or tablets, many kids don't. This might be the easiest way for young ones who want to both watch and play games on one system.\u2753Rumeur \u2013 L'application YouTube devrait arriver prochainement sur Nintendo Switch, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le 8 novembre si on en croit le site de Nintendo America. pic.twitter.com/NgvBhDJu1GYou can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
