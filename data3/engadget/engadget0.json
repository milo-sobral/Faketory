Not everyone knows that, though, and that's a problem when people may call the cops or break into your ride to rescue a pet that's actually quite safe.  You might not have to post a please-don't-worry sign on your window for much longer, however.  Elon Musk has signaled that he'll implement a \"dog mode\" in future Tesla software that would tell passers-by not to panic.  While he only just agreed to the idea (it's likely a long way off), it could include both a message and the current cabin temperature to assuage jittery humans.The future solution draws attention to a recurring problem for EVs: many people are still operating on assumptions that stem from the limitations of gas-powered cars.  While it's frequently impractical to leave a conventional car running to cool your dog or host a tailgate party, an EV can do that for hours at a time without flinching.  It might take widespread EV adoption before you can leave your pooch alone without needing a mode like this.YesExactlyYou can turn on your TV without requiring special hardware support.The space telescope has entered eternal sleep.The feature might be limited to live sports at first.The company said it has been dealing with an app 'issue.'It's stepping up its BFR plans instead."}
