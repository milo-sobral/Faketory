Users have noticed that the social network (part of Engadget's parent company Verizon) has been unavailable on the App Store. It's not certain what prompted the disappearance or who was responsible, but the outfit has talked about addressing an \"issue\" with the iOS release since November 16th.

If so, it suggests this is isn't due to an Apple concern. It typically wants less risqu\u00e9 material, after all.
