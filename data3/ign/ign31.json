If you\u2019re looking for an affordable 1080p, 144Hz curved gaming monitor the C27G1 (See it on Amazon) is a great option.The monitor has an obvious \u201cgamer\u201d aesthetic, with jagged edges on the stand and red accents on the front and back of the display. It doesn\u2019t have any LEDs or over-the-top flourishes though, so it stays in the realm of \u201cgaming monitor\u201d rather than \u201calien spaceship.\u201d The monitor can tilt up to 4 degrees forward and 21.5 degrees backward, swivel up to 34 degrees in either direction, and is height-adjustable. It also has a \u201cframeless\u201d design where the bezels are part of the screen rather than thick plastic edges around it. The C27G1 has decent IO options with one DisplayPort 1.2 port for your PC, two HDMI 1.4 ports (for game consoles or other devices), and a VGA port for legacy devices. It also has a 3.5mm audio out jack, if you prefer to send audio through your graphics card\u2019s HDMI port to speakers or headphones.The curved VA panel comes in at 1920x1080 resolution with a 144Hz refresh rate, and AMD\u2019s FreeSync built-in to eliminate screen tearing. At 27 inches, that means you don\u2019t have super-sharp pixel density here, which is apparent in desktop work, but not as much in games. The brightness is also a little low, measuring only 250cd/m2. But it\u2019s hard to complain too much since it's less than $300, especially when you consider the other specs. As a monitor designed for gaming rather than productivity, I'm willing to forgive a lower resolution in order to have 144Hz FreeSync.The on-screen display boasts a ton of different settings, but its controlled via a traditional line of buttons along the bottom, which make it slow and cumbersome to navigate. But once you get all your settings dialed in, hopefully you won\u2019t have to revisit the menu too often.I ran the C27G1 through a battery of tests using Lagom\u2019s LCD patterns, and despite being a value proposition, black and white levels were great, and I saw zero banding in grey-to-white gradients. Gamma was a touch low with a value of 2.1 (the target is 2.2), but colors looked quite accurate in my test clips, so you shouldn\u2019t have to do much tweaking to get a good image.Response time was the main sticking point\u2014AOC pegs grey-to-grey transitions at 4ms, which is typical for a VA panel. I noticed pretty heavy flickering in Lagom\u2019s test patterns, putting it in line with other VA panels I\u2019ve tested. (The 1ms response time on the box is Moving Picture Response Time, not the typical grey-to-grey value most displays quote.) However, in practice, you can reduce the ghosting caused by this slow response time with an Overdrive setting (more on that in a bit).As is typical for VA and IPS panels, I also noticed some slight backlight bleeding around the edges of the monitor, but it\u2019s far from the worst I\u2019ve seen. It shouldn\u2019t be too noticeable except on an entirely black screen, and I didn\u2019t find it to be much of a nuisance in gaming or movies. Viewing angles were good, not great, which is to be expected\u2014it\u2019s still significantly better than a TN display.My initial experience gaming on the C27G1 was, to put it mildly, a letdown\u2014at stock settings, this monitor has some serious ghosting, and even in a slower-paced game like Dishonored 2, slight movements turn the entire screen into a blurry mess. Thankfully, AOC\u2019s Overdrive feature (which is turned off by default) helped a fair amount: I recommend setting it to \u201cMedium\u201d or \u201cStrong\u201d. Strong produces less blur overall, but produces its own artifacts in certain conditions that might annoy some users. Try both to see which you prefer.There\u2019s also a Motion Blur Reduction (MBR) feature on this monitor, but it requires turning FreeSync off and playing your games at a very high framerate to work well. I found Overdrive to be sufficient in alleviating motion blur.Once I had Overdrive in place, gaming was a very pleasant experience. Motion, while not perfect, was much better, and the VA panel\u2019s color accuracy and 3000:1 contrast ratio produced a great looking image with darker blacks than most displays will provide. I didn\u2019t feel that the lower 1080p resolution harmed the gaming experience, producing a suitably sharp picture, and FreeSync prevented any nasty screen tearing thanks to my RX 580 graphics card. (Note: You\u2019ll need to use DisplayPort, not HDMI, to get FreeSync\u2019s full range\u2014which on this monitor is 48Hz-144Hz.)The 1800R curve is subtle in a monitor this size, so I can\u2019t say it led to any increased immersion, but it didn\u2019t produce any noticeable side effects either. Overall, this display checks the most important boxes, and performs admirably for the price.The AOC\u00a0C27G1 Curved Gaming Monitor has an MSRP of $325, but is usually on sale for a bit less on Amazon.  The AOC C27G1 isn\u2019t going to blow your mind, but at only $280 (street), it has great gaming features, and the stand\u2019s extra adjustability puts it ahead of other similarly-specced monitors at this price range. If you want an affordable 1080p display, this is a great option.We encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
