{"id": "It's Now Easy to Get Pokemon's Most Powerful Card", "paragraph": "If you buy something through this post, IGN may get a share of the sale. For more, read our\u00a0Terms of Use.If there\u2019s one card in the current competitive Pokemon scene that could be agreed upon as the most powerful of them all, it would be Tapu Lele-GX. Though it might not look like much to the uninitiated, the combination of its Supporter-searching ability, dependable colorless-energy attack, and lack of weakness make it so strong that it\u2019s a must-have for virtually every deck. Most players use at least one copy, but it\u2019s not uncommon to see multiple copies in a deck. The 2018 Pokemon TCG World Champion used three in his deck. It\u2019s just that good.The high demand for Tapu Lele-GX also means it was one of the most expensive Pokemon cards out there on the secondary market. Most competitively viable cards cost $5, $10, maybe $20 at most, but a single copy of Tapu Lele-GX could go for $50, and the rarer full art and rainbow versions could easily cost you over $100.But we\u2019re talking past tense here because Pokemon has just released a new product that contains a promo of Tapu Lele-GX, the Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Island Guardians GX Premium Collection. Players no longer need to open booster pack after booster pack hoping to get a copy of this much sought-after card when they can pick up this collection and be guaranteed a copy. With a more easily attainable version now purchasable in stores, the price on Tapu Lele-GX has dropped across the board. As of this writing, the market price for Tapu Lele-GX is down to $16.12, according to TCGplayer.com. (The full-art has dropped to $27.68 and the rainbow to $44.84, if you were wondering.)Image Credit: The Pokemon Company.The Premium Collection box retails for $49.99 \u00a0and comes with promos of Tapu Lele-GX and Tapu Fini-GX, a Tapu Lele coin, an oversized Tapu Lele-GX card, a playmat featuring all four Island Guardians, and an assortment of eight booster packs. So in addition to getting Tapu Lele-GX, you also get a variety of other goodies along with it.
