For reference, the characters Papyrus and Mettaton are both known to speak this way, though Mettaton stops doing this once he transforms into Mettaton EX.The full message spread throughout the tweets reads: \u201cWELCOME. HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR ME? HOW WONDERFUL. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU AS WELL. I HAVE SOMETHING, SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU. SOMETHING I THINK YOU WILL FIND VERY, VERY INTERESTING. BUT IT IS NOT YET COMPLETE. NO, IT IS FAR FROM COMPLETE. THUS I HAVE A SMALL FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU. RETURN HERE IN [24] HOURS. AT THAT TIME, I WILL ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. THEN, USING YOUR RESPONSES, WE WILL APPROACH ITS REALIZATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. I WILL BE IN CONTACT AGAIN SOON.\n\nWhat exactly Fox has planned is anyone\u2019s guess, but whether it be an expansion to Undertale, a proper sequel, or a new project entirely will hopefully be cleared up by tomorrow morning.In our review of Undertale, we called the game a \u201cMasterpiece\u201d saying, \"It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player\u2019s mindset, that it couldn\u2019t have been told in any other way.\"\n\nUndertale was recently released on the Nintendo Switch\u00a0alongside 16 other games.
