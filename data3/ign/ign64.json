{"id": "Fortnite's Cube Exploded and Threw Players Into an Endless Void", "paragraph": "Fortnite's beloved cube exploded and sent players witnessing the one-time event into a strange void.Players from around the world gathered in different matches at the same time to see the one-time event. The cube at the center of Leaky Lake began to spin uncontrollably before it unleashed a bright light and sent everyone into an endless void.\n\nOnce in the void, players could move freely through the warped space. Butterflies made of rifts floated about the area and players who got close enough would start an animation that ultimately returned them to the normal map.Players then appeared above the cube's previous location where Leaky Lake transformed once again into a new area with additional land.A look at the void.Originally, the purple cube\u00a0first spawned midway through Season 5\u00a0where it romped around the map and eventually\u00a0melted into Loot Lake. The cube returned at the\u00a0start of Season 6\u00a0where it created a vortex and started traveling once again. The cube and vortex returned to Leaky Lake for the\u00a0Fortnitemares event\u00a0and stayed put until today.The first one-time event saw the\u00a0launch of the rocket\u00a0during Season 4 where it ultimately ripped the sky and\u00a0created a giant rift.\n\nWith the event finished, the Lil' Kevin Challenges are now available.
