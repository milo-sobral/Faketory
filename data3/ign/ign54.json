{"id": "How the Director of the Metal Gear Movie Would Make a Zelda Movie", "paragraph": "Note: This article was originally published on July 21, 2018 during San Diego Comic-Con, but in light of recent news that Castlevania producer Adi Shankar may be making a Legend of Zelda TV series, we've repromoted it to highlight another filmmaker's take on the idea. Speaking on IGN\u2019s Comic-Con live show about his upcoming Metal Gear Solid movie, we asked director Jordan Vogt-Roberts for his take on how he would make a Zelda movie if he had the opportunity.\u201cThe thing about Zelda is Zelda is not Lord of the Rings, right? You cannot forget how quirky and bizarre Zelda is,\u201d Vogt-Roberts said. \u201cI think you need to find a way to actually fuse the traditional Zelda and the very new Zelda,\u201d \n\n\u201cI think you have to find a way to very intensely fuse the pure just sort of fantasy of The Ocarina of Time and The Link to the Past, but then I think you need to find a way to incorporate the newer pseudo-tech stuff -- you know, the lasers and Tron lines that happen in the newer games, but in a way that\u2019s not overwhelming.\u201dOn top of that, Vogt-Roberts said he wouldn\u2019t want to make Link talk. \u201cI actually fully think Link should not speak the entire film. I would do a film where he\u2019s a silent protagonist.\u201dYou can watch the full interview with Vogt-Roberts in the video at the top of the page, with the Zelda conversation starting around the 6:45 mark.Tom Marks is IGN's PC Editor and pie maker.
