{"id": "Netflix's The Witcher Cast vs. Video Game Characters", "paragraph": "Editor's note: Not all of the cast members' characters make appearances in the games, so some actors aren't included on this list. The cast for Netflix's upcoming adaption of The Witcher\u00a0is filling out nicely, especially with the recent addition of Freya Allan as Ciri, Princess of Cintra, and\u00a0Anya Chalotra as the sorceress\u00a0Yennefer.Allan and Chalotra will join Henry Cavill - previously revealed to be Geralt of Rivia - in what is sure to be an ambitious undertaking\u00a0from the streaming provider. Not only is The Witcher a beloved book series written by Andrzej Sapkowski, but also a popular video game franchise, developed by Polish studio CD Projekt\u00a0Red.Even though the upcoming series is based on the mythology from Sapkowski's books and not the games, we thought it would be fun to see how the live-action characters compare to their digital counterparts, which you can see in the gallery below:Per Netflix, \"The Witcher is an epic tale of fate and family. Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a dangerous secret, the three must learn to navigate the increasingly volatile Continent together.\"The Witcher will be led by showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (Marvel\u2019s Daredevil), with the first four episodes directed by Alik Sakharov (Game of Thrones).No release date has been announced.\n\nDavid Griffin still watches DuckTales in his pajamas with a cereal bowl in hand.
