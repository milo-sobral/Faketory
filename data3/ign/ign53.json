{"id": "Red Dead Redemption 2 Achieves Biggest Opening Weekend in Entertainment History", "paragraph": "Red Dead Redemption 2 had the largest opening weekend for any entertainment product in history,\u00a0managing to\u00a0sell through $725 million\u00a0in copies over just three days.It's actually the\u00a0second-highest grossing entertainment launch, although Rockstar won't be too unhappy with that, given that the record-holder is\u00a0Grand Theft Auto V.The discrepancy between biggest opening weekend and biggest overall launch comes down to the fact that the last GTA was released on a Tuesday.\n\nGiven that Grand Theft Auto V was initially released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, this means Red Dead Redemption 2 now holds the record for the largest launch of the console generation.Rockstar Games did not share the exact unit sales for Red Dead Redemption 2, but the sell-through numbers suggest it's more than 10 million. These numbers represent the total sales to customers, rather than those from the publisher to retailers.Additionally, Red Dead Redemption 2 had the largest launch sales of any game released on the PlayStation Network to date, and it was the most pre-ordered game of all time on the PlayStation Network.Red Dead Redemption 2 certainly deserves the sales, if our review is any indication.
