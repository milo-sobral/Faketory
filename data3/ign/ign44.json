{"id": "Stranger Things Season 3 Will Bring Back Mind Flayer", "paragraph": "Though fans suspected as much, an official Stranger Things behind-the-scenes companion guide called Worlds Turned Upside Down has confirmed that the Mind Flayer, aka the Shadow Monster, will indeed be returning for Season 3.Spoiler warning: spoilers for Stranger Things Season 2 ahead.As reported by Screen Rant, the book\u2019s epilogue makes some pretty concrete teases for the upcoming season. \"The Mind Flayer hasn't lost interest in Hawkins,\u201d it reads. \"The tentacled creature continues to loom near Hawkins inside the Upside Down, and its malevolent influence isn't absent from the new season.\"Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy follows this with a quote, saying:\u00a0\"We ended season two with a clear signal that the Shadow Monster was not eliminated, and maybe he's even identified his foe. And that darkness, and the battle that it will require, grows in season three.\u201d The book says Season 3 will be set in the summer of 1985 with a new and returning cast of characters, and describes the upcoming season as \u201cThe final summer of their childhood.\"\u00a0\n\nFans will remember that the second season ended on a positive note, with a school dance accented by a kiss between Eleven and Mike. The camera pulls out from the gymnasium, slowly turning to reveal that the upside down is still intact, and that the Mind Flayer is looming menacingly over the dance from this parallel reality. With Levy saying it has identified its foe, this suggests that Eleven, and perhaps the rest of her friends, will be a major target in Season 3.For more on Stranger Things, check out how Season 3 will draw inspiration from a certain \u201880s comedy, and how the Stranger Things Season 3 teaser trailer hints at a summer 2019 release.\n\nColin Stevens is a freelance writer for IGN.
