{"id": "Diablo: Immortal Reveal Met with Negative Response by Fans, Blizzard Responds", "paragraph": "UPDATE 11/2: Speaking with IGN at BlizzCon, Blizzard\u2019s Wyatt Cheng responded to the community reaction to Diablo: Immortal\u2019s announcement, as well as the accusations that it\u2019s just a reskin of a previous NetEase mobile game.\u201cI don\u2019t think mobile should be a dirty word,\u201d Cheng said, explaining that the developers at Blizzard play and enjoy games on all platforms. \u201cWhen it came to looking at making a new Diablo game, and this opportunity to partner with NetEase to make this \u2013 the technology is there, where our mobile phones are more powerful than ever, and they\u2019re capable of top tier gaming experiences.\u201dCheng responded to claims that Diablo: Immortal may be a reskin by saying the following: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with NetEase Games from the beginning as a partnership to create everything in Diablo: Immortal. We have artists on our side, they have artists on their side, and we work together as a team, as a partnership to create everything about Diablo: Immortal. The environments, the characters, the skills, the story.\u201dYou can read the original story below:  \n\nDuring the BlizzCon opening ceremony, Blizzard announced Diablo: Immortal, a brand-new Diablo game made exclusively for iOS and Android mobile devices, but the Diablo community has reacted extremely negatively.The cinematic reveal trailer\u00a0has vastly more dislikes than likes on YouTube, with 85K dislikes compared to 3.3K likes at the time this article was published. Its gameplay trailer has a similar ratio, with 45K dislikes and 2.1K likes. \n\nAdditionally, there are reports on Reddit that negative comments are being removed from the trailers \u2013 though there are currently still plenty there to read.The backlash has even manifested in-person at BlizzCon, with one attendee sarcastically asking the Diablo developers if the game\u2019s announcement was \u201can out-of-season April Fool\u2019s joke.\u201d Blizzard responded by saying \u201cNo, it\u2019s a fully-fledged Diablo experience on mobile.\u201dMy god, the savagery. The absolute savagery. #diabloimmortal #Diablo #diablo @LaymenGaming pic.twitter.com/Jvt4XzswzS\u2014 Skill Up reviewing #RDR2 (@SkillUpYT) November 2, 2018This negative response is likely fueled by long-standing rumors and expectations around new Diablo games on the way. Blizzard stated it has \u201cmultiple Diablo projects in the works\u201d back in August, and that hype was built up further when people saw that Diablo got the prime panel spot directly after BlizzCon\u2019s opening ceremony.Many people assumed the teases were for an inevitable Diablo 4 announcement, but Blizzard tried to temper that expectation a couple weeks ago. It\u2019s easy to see why a mobile Diablo game developed by third-party studio NetEase isn\u2019t quite what fans of the series were hoping for \u2013 though asking rude questions during a live panel is almost certainly a less constructive way to express that disappointment than disliking a video or leaving negative feedback online.\n\nThe Diablo community has also expressed concerns on Reddit related to NetEase\u2019s past projects. One thread on the Diablo subreddit has pointed out the undeniable similarities between Diablo: Immortal and a previously released NetEase mobile game called Endless of God, saying Immortal looks like a Diablo-themed clone or reskin rather than a brand-new game.IGN will have multiple interviews with Blizzard developers throughout the weekend and will update this story with any official comment we receive regarding fan reactions or the similarities to Endless of God.Our own James Duggan got to play Diablo: Immortal at BlizzCon and said he wasn\u2019t exactly sold on it yet.
