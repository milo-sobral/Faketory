{"id": "The Kylo Ren Joke That Had to Be Changed for Ralph Breaks the Internet", "paragraph": "[EDITION NAME]The Kylo Ren Joke That Had to Be Changed for Ralph Breaks the InternetDisney\u2019s first Wreck-It Ralph came out in 2012, the same week that the studio announced its acquisition of Lucasfilm. Which is to say, new Star Wars movies were barely a twinkle in the eye of the Mouse House at the time. But now six years have passed, which has provided the filmmakers behind the Wreck-It sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet plenty of Star Wars fodder to play with amid the film\u2019s many nods to other Disney properties like Marvel and the Disney princesses.And yet, there was one particularly noteworthy joke that didn\u2019t make the cut.As directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston and head of story Josie Trinidad explain it, Disney declined to run with a certain Kylo Ren gag.\u201cAt one point we had a joke about Kylo Ren being kind of a spoiled child,\u201d laughs Moore. \u201cWe went to Lucasfilm and said, here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And they said, well, we\u2019d prefer that you don\u2019t show him as a spoiled child. You know, he is our villain, and we\u2019d prefer you don\u2019t do that. So we were respectful of that.\u201dIt\u2019s just part of the process, the filmmakers explain, but also the whole point of including beloved and familiar Disney characters in Ralph Breaks the Internet is to \u201chonor who these characters are\u201d and be appropriate to their history while taking \u201cplayful jabs.\u201d Like C-3PO being the butler to the princesses, for example. That \u201cfelt like that\u2019s of his character,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cIt\u2019s really loving satire that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cMostly at our own expense, with our jobs!\u201d smiles Moore.In Ralph Breaks the Internet, Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) have to leave Mr. Litwak\u2019s arcade and venture into the scary territory of the online landscape in an attempt to find a replacement part for Vanellope\u2019s game Sugar Rush. This leads to them discovering, to borrow a familiar Disney phrase, a whole new world\u2026 but it\u2019s one that the two friends find themselves feeling very differently about.Check out all the Easter Eggs in the Ralph Breaks the Internet trailer above.\u201cWe definitely thought of Litwak\u2019s arcade like a small hometown,\u201d says Trinidad. \u201cAnd these two country bumpkins from the small hometown are going to New York City, or Tokyo, or London, or all those three cities combined. At first it was, what fun are these two kids gonna have in exploring this great city? But ultimately what we realized was this is about the city sort of testing their friendship.\u201dVanellope starts to fall in love with the outside world while Ralph longs for the comforts of home.\u201cHe wants to kind of complete the mission and get back home and get back to life as normal,\u201d says Moore. \u201cBut we\u2019re not making a judgement about that, you know? It\u2019s great that Ralph loves his home here, and it\u2019s good that she likes what she\u2019s discovering. So it\u2019s really kind of an examination of, can two best friends -- who thought that they were alike in every way -- have varying kinds of points of view about life and still remain friends?\u201dAs Johnston points out, the team wanted to be sure to show both the \u201cbeautiful and also very ugly\u201d sides of the internet. The good and the bad. \u201cYou could go on the internet and take a class on MIT for free, and you could also go and have someone tell you you\u2019re an idiot for no good reason,\u201d he laughs. Hence Ralph Breaks the Internet\u2019s depiction of the Dark Web, which started with concepts like dark alleyways with signs for body parts, social security numbers, passwords, mother\u2019s maiden names and so on. That\u2019s where the character Double Dan came from, who can be spotted in the trailers for the film.Watch the full trailer for Ralph Breaks the Internet above.\u201cIt\u2019s where Ralph goes to procure a virus,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cHe makes a terrible choice, as Ralph does, and he goes and he meets this worm guy, Double Dan, who Alfred Molina does the voice for, who\u2019s possibly my favorite character in the history of animation. He\u2019s this giant, Jabba the Hutt-looking worm guy with a vestigial twin.\u201dDan\u2019s twin is in his neck, and while he barely talks -- \u201cLittle Dan just squeaks,\u201d says Moore -- there was a \u201cLady and the Tramp moment\u201d between the two Dans that, alas, did not make it into the film.\u201cThey were eating a virus, and ended up kissing each other! It didn\u2019t even end up in the cut,\u201d laments Johnston.Since this idea was only boarded and not fully animated, it was easy enough to cut from the film. And that\u2019s the key to the process. \u201cBe wrong fast\u201d is a catchphrase of Pixar filmmaker/legend Andrew Stanton, and so the storyboards are where the keep it or cut it decisions are largely made -- the part of the process where elements can be dropped without a big fuss.\u201cI was like, I wanna see that!\u201d says Trinidad. \u201cBecause I always want to try things. Because story is that, it\u2019s disposable. And I don\u2019t want to have this go all the way into animation and realize, okay, the Lady and the Tramp thing, it\u2019s not working. I\u2019d rather get it out really rough and really fast. We try it.\u201dOne thing that may yet be tried -- assuming this sequel does well enough to merit a third film in the series -- could be a 3D printed version of Ralph who actually exists in the \u201creal\u201d world. This is just the filmmakers spitballing ideas for now, but it is a concept that has been with them for several years now.\u201cWe went to South by Southwest, the technology conference, like four years ago when we were first starting talking about this movie, when 3D printers were just out,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cAnd I took a picture of us in front of a 3D printer and was like, this is the moment we got the idea for a movie! Ralph is going to 3D print himself, he\u2019s going to go into the real world, and he\u2019s going to be a real boy!\u201dRalph Breaks the Internet will be released on November 21, 2018.Talk to Executive Editor Scott Collura on Twitter at @ScottCollura, or listen to his Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3.
