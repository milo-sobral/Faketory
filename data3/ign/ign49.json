{"id": "10 Zombie Movies You Need to Watch", "paragraph": "I\u2019d be remiss in my duties as a world-renowned zombie scholar and expert \u2013 yes, dear reader, there are such things! \u2013 if I didn\u2019t remind you all to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Night of the Living Dead during this Halloween season. And for dedicated zombie aficionados, I know there\u2019s little I can do to inform you about all the many other intriguing, entertaining, or flat-out insane zombie movies that exist beyond the timeless classic created by George Romero, John Russo, and their amazing team.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re only just getting into the whole zombie \"thing.\" Maybe you watched some Walking Dead, finally checked out Night via the recent Fathom Events screenings or the Criterion Blu-ray release (both featuring the new, stunning 4K restoration of the classic film), and now want to know: What do I watch next? In that case, may I suggest the following 10 zombie films from the entire history of the genre?But note, this is\u00a0not a ranked list, nor a \u201cbest of.\u201d They\u2019re merely suggestions, and there are hundreds more to choose from. Perhaps these will lead you to discovering some new favorites!Plot: A young couple head to Haiti, where peril awaits in the form of zombie master Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi)!Why It Matters: This is the world\u2019s first actual zombie movie, and it\u2019s still a fascinating early use of the zombie to represent the dehumanization of indigenous people as slaves.Look For: A wordless sequence in which a zombie falls into the grinding gears of a relentless mill; the sound design alone is harrowing.Plot: A young nurse travels to Haiti, where peril awaits in the form of local folklore, a wandering singer, and a zombie called Carrefour.Why It Matters: This is Jane Eyre with zombies, a stylish Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur production that offers atmosphere and poetry to spare.Look For: A dark journey along shadowy paths with only the whistling wind to keep you company as two women journey to the houmfort.Plot: Aliens attempt to invade Earth by reanimating our own dead and using them to attack the living.Why It Matters: Almost identical in plot to Plan 9 From Outer Space, this film partly inspired the look of Night of the Living Dead\u2019s ghouls.Look For: John Carradine delivering a doomsday speech with all the gravitas you\u2019d expect from one of the legends of horror cinema.Plot: Vincent Price battles disheveled, vampiric undead in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a global epidemic.Why It Matters: The first adaptation of Richard Matheson\u2019s 1954 novel, I Am Legend, the film not only features familiar ghouls, but also a \"house under siege\" motif that Romero and Co. will borrow with abandon in Night of the Living Dead.Look For: The scene in which someone comes to visit, whispering eerily as a doorknob turns with menace and foreboding\u2026\n\nWatch the video above about the adaptations of\u00a0I Am Legend.Why It Matters: Romero\u2019s second Dead film is in many ways the true foundation for everything familiar about the modern zombie genre, from the creatures\u2019 behavior to the conspicuous social commentary.Look For: Roger\u2019s moment of zombie-like fascination as he plays a racing game, revealing just how blurred the line really is between us and them.\n\nWatch the video above for our History of Awesome episode on Dawn of the Dead.Why It Matters: It\u2019s my pick for the most quintessentially depraved and bizarre Italian zombie movie ever made, and if nothing else, you need to see Peter Bark as Michael.Look For: Michael\u2019s final moments with his mother are, to be sure, unforgettable.Why It Matters: This movie, originally conceived by Night\u2019s co-creator, John Russo, introduced the idea of zombies wanting brains specifically. It\u2019s also awesome.Look For: A multitude of strange references to one character\u2019s possible history as a former Nazi.Why It Matters: This may be one of the most dream-like explorations of the genre ever made, with moments of excessive gore juxtaposed with painterly compositions.Look For: The love that can only exist between a mentally handicapped fellow and a reanimated head.Plot: Four post-apocalyptic survivors go on a road trip to find an amusement park, some Twinkies\u2026and themselves.Why It Matters: The film\u2019s use of on-screen rules, and a third act park showdown, capture the early 21st century gaming culture through the lens of a zombie apocalypse.Look For: A scene where one character earnestly explains the premise of Hannah Montana.Plot: It\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, only \u201cR\u201d is a zombie\u2026and what a lovable fellow he is, too.Why It Matters: This is one of many recent stories that humanize the zombie and explore the possibility of curing the creature, adding welcome notes of hope and triumph to a genre that frequently lacks those elements.Look For: A scene where R is compared favorably to Ol\u2019 Worm-Eye from Zombi 2.For more on these and many more zombie films, check out Arnold T.
