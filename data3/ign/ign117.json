{"id": "Netflix's Dogs: Season 1 Review", "paragraph": "Note: this is a spoiler-free review of Dogs, which is available to stream now on Netflix.Netflix has become a great source for documentary and reality TV fanatics lately. But sometimes it's hard to work up the energy to watch a series like Making a Murderer, knowing full well you're just going to come away feeling depressed and hopeless. Fortunately, Netflix also seems to have specialized in \"comfort food documentaries,\" shows that actively work to cheer you up and make you feel a little bit better about the state of the world. First, there was the surprisingly excellent revival of Queer Eye. Now there's Dogs, a series for anyone who's ever wasted hours ogling dog pictures on Instagram or used the phrase \"H*ckin' good pupper\" in casual conversation.Dogs is a six-part documentary series from executive producers Glen Zipper and Amy Berg. Berg is notable for her Oscar-nominated 2006 documentary Deliver Us From Evil, which focuses on the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal. Thankfully, there's nothing so bleak about this particular project. The series is dedicated to exploring the thesis that dogs are good and we should all spend more time appreciating what they do for us. So basically, its the least offensive, most crowd-pleasing documentary premise imaginable.The beauty of Dogs is that it isn't really about Dogs themselves so much as the impact they have on the lives of their owners. Each episode offers a standalone look at a different pup and their owner. For example, \"The Kid With a Dog\" focuses on an 11-year-old girl named Heidi who grapples with regular seizures, and who relies on a pup named Rory to alert adults. \"Bravo, Zeus\" shifts to a Syrian refugee named Ayham, who's desperate to get his dog Zeus across the border into Lebanon. The series winds up taking a very global approach to showcasing dogs and dog owners, venturing from the US to the Middle East to Europe to Japan to Costa Rica. That approach provides a welcome window into other cultures and other lives.If the goal of a good documentary is not just to educate, but to foster empathy for the subject matter, then Dogs is a complete success. I was especially taken with \"Bravo, Zeus.\" With as much as the Syrian Civil War has dominated the news headlines in recent years, it's easy to lose sight of the immense toll that conflict has taken on the people living through it day in and day out. That episode combines harrowing footage of war-ravaged Damascus with intimate looks at the day-to-day lives of Ayham and his family. By the end, there's a strong sense of what Ayham has suffered through, and why reuniting with his best four-legged friend is so important to a man who's been displaced from his home, his family, and everything he knows.Not every storyline is quite as dramatic. For example, \"Ice on the Water\" directs its attention towards an Italian fisherman/restaurant owner named Alessandro. Alessandro isn't grappling with a life-threatening medical condition or a humanitarian crisis, but simply the stress of trying to keep his business afloat in a sluggish economy and the pained realization that his children aren't interested in carrying on the family legacy. Then there's the most purely fun installment, \"Scissors Down,\" about two Japanese groomers participating in a competition. Those hoping for a nonfiction version of the mockumentary Best in Show will find what they're looking for here.\n\nIs Dogs emotionally manipulative? Probably. Zipper and Berg clearly want to elicit specific reactions from their viewers. Most of the time, Dogs is a very pleasant, life-affirming experience. Seeing these dogs calmly go about their business even as they profoundly improve the lives of their owners warms the heart. Yet the show can just as easily start the waterworks flowing when it feels the need. The final episode, \"Second Chances,\" is the big culprit in that regard. With its emphasis on a woman trying to find a home for a group of shelter dogs and various shots of small critters gazing despondently from their cages, that episode occasionally plays like an SPCA commercial without the Sarah McLachlan soundtrack.But regardless of what emotions the series is trying to draw forth, there's no denying the care that went into filming each episode. Berg herself helmed two of the episodes, with Jesus Camp director Heidi Ewing and Undefeated's Daniel Lindsay among the other directors pitching in here. The result is a gorgeously shot documentary that frequently lingers on the dogs and their quiet interactions with the humans around them. Shot like Planet Earth II, it may be the best Netflix documentary for those wanting to put their 4K setup through its paces.Dogs is a strong choice for any Netflix subscriber who just wants to spend six hours retreating from life and feeling positive vibes. These six episodes celebrate the profound bond between dogs and their owners, showcasing how much we all have in common when it comes to our shared love of furry friends. The series may toy with the viewer's emotions from time to time, but it's impossible not to come away feeling a little bit better about humanity.
