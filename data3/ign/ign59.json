{"id": "PS4 Surpasses 85 Million Units Sold", "paragraph": "Sony has revealed that the PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro have, combined, sold 86.1 million units as of the end of the company's last fiscal quarter.In Sony's earnings report for Q2 of fiscal year 2018 (which ended on Sept. 30), the company reported 3.9 million PS4 units sold, which, tacked onto the 82.2 million total units reported in Sony's last fiscal report, brings the PS4 up to 86.1 million lifetime sales. This new figure is down from the same period last year, however, in which Sony reported 4.2 million units sold.Despite that down trend year over year, Sony has increased its forecast for the entire fiscal year, now believing it will sell 17.5 million PS4s rather than the originally reported 17 million. This uptick is attributed to several factors, including increased software sales \u2014 and we've seen those sales successes with both God of War earlier this year and Spider-Man's record-breaking sales last month \u2014 the impact of foreign exchange rates, an increase in hardware sales (over what was expected), and an increase in PlayStation Plus sales.For more on all things PlayStation, check out the latest episode of our weekly PlayStation show, Beyond!, below, and head to beyond.ign.com for more episodes, live streams, and more commentary.\n\nAnd for even more on the latest and upcoming PlayStation releases, check out IGN's review of Spider-Man's The Heist DLC, check out our updated best PS4 games list, and read why we think remasters and remakes hurt the PlayStation Classic's lineup.Jonathon Dornbush is IGN's News Editor, PlayStation lead, and Beyond! host.
