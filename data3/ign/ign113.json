{"id": "DC Universe's Titans Reveals Batmobile, Bat Computer", "paragraph": "In Episode 6 of DC Universe's Titans, we get a quick glimpse of both the Batmobile and the Bat Computer while watching a flashback of Dick Grayson, dressed as Robin, investigating a crime.Take a look by flipping through the slideshow below:As you can see, the long, sleek design looks to\u00a0be taking inspiration from the Batmobile of Batman: The Animated Series, but it does take a few liberties, like the thin red accent line going along the side of the car. Though out of focus, the front of the car appears to have some subtle red elements, as well. Red is not an uncommon design choice for the Batmobile, as we've seen in the Adam West, Batman Beyond, and Grant Morrison versions.As for the Bat Computer, it\u2019s a bit on the lean side with only a few large monitors comprising the system. There\u2019s less of a definitive vision for what the Bat Computer should look like, with some iterations showing Batman using a very simple setup and some, like The Dark Knight movie, featuring a massive rig.What do you think of this latest addition to the long line of Batmobile designs? Let us know in the comments.For more from Titans, read our review of the episode and check out our interview with the actor who plays Jason Todd aka Robin 2.0 as he talks about this latest episode.\n\nJoshua is Senior Editor of IGN Comics.
