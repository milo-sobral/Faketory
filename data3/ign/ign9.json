{"id": "Daredevil Season 3, Episode 11: \"Reunion\" Review", "paragraph": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for Daredevil Season 3, Episode 11. If you need a refresher on where we left off, check out our review of Season 3, episode 10.\"I know who you are, Mr. Fisk. You\u2019re a wolf too.\"As we head into the home stretch of Season 3, \"Reunion\" reforms and re-galvanizes the show's core trio - Matt, Karen, and Foggy - while also finding moments of redemption for Sister Maggie and Agent Nadeem. It's a gripping boxed-in/search-and-rescue story - not unlike Season 1's \"Condemned\" - that places Matt and Karen in a pressure cooker while restoring Fisk to the mountain top.For Fisk, Season 3 has been about reclaiming his throne. He never intended to fly the coop and run off with Vanessa. He wanted to get back to where he was in Season 1: to being the guy in penthouse who secretly control all the crime in the city, with Vanessa at his side. A guy who's also so untouchable that he can commit brutal murder in front of his cronies (in this case, the actual FBI) and not feel the slightest bit of worry. Remember Season 1's car door slammage of doom? Now we've got \"Give me your jacket.\" Sheesh. Fisk, now fully exonerated, and with federal agents under his control, can finally let off steam. You know, like only he can. With the stark and savage killing of an underling.Fisk's press conference is inadvertently hilarious because his voice is so graveled and monstrous that it feels strange for his \"I am not evil\" speech to land so well. He sounds like icy frozen death and somehow he's able to calm down an angry crowd. His voice only makes him sound more sinister, if anything. The slo-mo strut out of the elevator is pretty awesome though.By the end of \"Reunion,\" it's crystal clear: Matt and company have to stop Fisk right now - before it's too late. Before his control reaches any further. They have allies; Maggie meanders around the church, throwing Fisk's agents off their trail, getting nuns to lie for her so that search dogs can't pick up their scent, but she can only do so much. Her maneuvers in episode 11 are mini-acts of atonement for the guilt she feels. Not that she wouldn't have helped out anyway, but her sneakiness here parallels her woefulness.In the end, it's Nadeem and (the return of) Detective Mahoney who really save Karen's bacon. While Dex goes off the deep end, hearing white noise and murdering passers-by out of sheer frustration, Nadeem has to carry the weight of this entire s*** storm on his shoulders. Nadeem was a chore to endure at first, but the perverse Monkey's Paw-esque \"be careful what you wish for\" arc they put him in, starting back in \"Revelations,\" really helped rebuild him as a new character - one who pretty much has to sacrifice himself in order to get out of the mess he helped create\"Reunion,\" bottom line, is a crowd pleaser. Admittedly, I wasn't looking forward to the conversations that needed to be had about Matt wanting to kill Fisk. His friends were going to chastise him. He was going to find himself on the opposite end of the famed chat he had with Punisher back in Season 2, where Frank was the one arguing that some people were above the law and needed to be put down. But we don't get too much of that, actually. We're spared most of that spiel. Firstly, Matt gets no argument from Karen. Then, in the end, Foggy only scolds him a little. And Matt, now happy to have the band back together, doesn't bicker back all that much.Absent from the previous episode, Foggy returns in \"Reunion\" for the episode's best moment: The rescuing of Karen under the protection of him and the NYPD. I've always been pro-Foggy. He's a tenaciously smart character who you feel absolutely safe around when it comes to matters of the law, which this show deals with quite a bit. He'll never be marked safe, mind you, and the show can surely still kill him off, but his energy and confidence when it comes to attacking bad guys using legal tactics is a dynamic that would be sorely missed.Suffice to say, Karen, after this particular crucible, is most likely safe forever now. As Matt puts it, \"If you get caught, all of this was for nothing.\" Still, I can't help but think that another reason, a big factor, why Season 3 is playing so well is that there's an underlying finality to this story. Story-wise, this could easily be the last run. And with the recent news of Iron Fist, and now Luke Cage, being canceled, you can't help but wonder if the writing is on the wall for all of the Defenders. At least Daredevil would be going out on top.Finally here, what's the ultimate point of the Mrs. Falb scene? Look, I like Leslie Ann Warren, but is this a one-off moment, meant to show Fisk that he'll never get the full support of the public like he wants? We're so used to, on these shows, getting introduced to a totally new face in a scene that lingers on a bit too long that I suppose it doesn't make all that much difference. But Season 3 is, and has been, very purposeful with its set up (basically turning most everything into Chekhov's Gun) so it stands to reason Mrs. Falb, or this scene, will wind up being important in ways we can't predict.\"Reunion\" nicely ushers us into Season 3's endgame, reforming our heroic O.G. trio for (ostensibly) their final battle with Wilson Fisk. It's mostly a stationary search-and-rescue mission, but a crowd-pleasing one that doesn't hammer us over the head with too much chatter about Matt's lapsing morality. Once Matt, Karen, and Foggy re-discover their friendship, things become about toppling Fisk and staying alive - not about all the ways Matt's gone astray.
