{"id": "Wildfire Charity Stream - Fallout 76 for Fire Victims", "paragraph": "The California Wildfires have been raging for over a week now and though the people of San Francisco have to deal with the smoke, many others have lost so much more. As the shelters have been inundated with donations and help from people who have a lot to give they've asked for donations to Habitat for Humanity or the American Red Cross. Today we're playing Fallout 76 to help those victims of the fires and to give a little bit back. Join us on our adventures below and if you can spare some change, please share it with those in need. Donate via the stream here!Destin Legarie is a Senior Features Producer at IGN. You can follow him on Twitter.We encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY."}
