{"id": "Fortnite: Live Cube Event Scheduled for Today", "paragraph": "UPDATE: At 10:00AM PT, the cube exploded, and threw players into an endless void.Another one-time Fortnite event is set to begin today at 10 am PT/1 pm ET where players can watch the almighty cube make its next big move.Epic announced the in-game event earlier this morning with a simple tease of the cube's \"overwhelming\" power.\u00a0Players expecting to watch the event through the Playground mode will be left disappointed as it appears Epic has disabled both the Disco Domination and Playground playlists. Epic also suggests players log onto Fortnite early to avoid queue times.\n\nAccording to Fortnite Intel, datamined code for the event suggests players won't be able to use weapons or defeat other players. Regardless, we suggest staying cautious throughout the event. During a previous event, one player managed to break the solo kill record with 33 kills by destroying a ramp holding a group of players.Fortnite's lovable purple cube first spawned onto the map back in Season 5 where it traveled the map and eventually melted into Loot Lake.Players are greeted with this message when starting up Fortnite.At the start of Season 6, the cube took over the Loot Lake island and began moving across the map with a vortex allowing players to propel themselves into the air. The cube and vortex returned to the now named Leaky Lake for the Fortnitemares event and has been growing in power ever since.The first one-time event saw the launch of the rocket during Season 4 where it ultimately ripped the sky and created a giant rift.\n\nMichael Koczwara is IGN's Weekend Web Producer who wants peace among other players during the event.
