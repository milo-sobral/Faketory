{"id": "Child's Play: New Poster, Release Date Revealed for Chucky Reboot", "paragraph": "MGM and Orion Pictures have released a new poster for Child's Play, the Chucky reboot, that reveals a June 21, 2019 release date.\"More than a toy... he's your best friend,\" reads the poster, which depicts a warehouse full\u00a0of boxes of\u00a0Buddi\u00a0toys. A box in the foreground gives a good look at the packaging, which includes a WiFi signal above the \"i\" in Buddi. Icons along the side of the box indicate Buddi\u00a0can be controlled by phones, tablets, and computers when connected to WiFi.All of this indicates that the Child's Play remake will put a modern stamp on the 1988 original's formula. In September, it was revealed that Child's Play will chronicle how things take a turn for the worst after a mother named Karen (Aubrey Plaza) gifts her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) a toy doll that, unbeknownst to them, has an evil nature.The reboot was first said to be in the works in July. A TV series is also reportedly being developed, but it's said to follow the most recent line of Child's Play films including 2017's Cult of Chucky, rather than being set in the same universe as the reboot.\n\nNick Santangelo is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia.
