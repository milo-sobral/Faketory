At Pachyderm, OSS user and customer feedback is a major driver of our product roadmap and we believe that everyone within the company should experience that first-hand.Pachyderm is just 8 people right now, so you'd be getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product.
