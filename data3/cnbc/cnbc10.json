To get into correction territory, the benchmark index would need to fall to 2,645, a level not seen since May. A 15 percent drop would take it negative for the year.Paulsen told CNBC a correction is necessary to reflect a changing market environment where rates are on the rise, earnings are peaking, and economic growth might slow.\"What we need is a lower valuation, I think, to sustain a different environment if this recovery is going to continue,\" he said. \"I don't think we can handle that environment at 20-some-times trailing earnings, probably more like 15 to 16 times trailing earnings and we're a ways from that,\" the investor added.The S&P 500 currently trades at 19 times trailing earnings, one of its highest multiples in the past decade. High-growth sectors including technology and consumer discretionary trade, with a multiple above 20 times trailing earnings.\"It's probably time to get more defensive and not have as much octane on from here as you have earlier in this bull market,\" said Paulsen, highlighting safety sectors such as utilities, staples, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) as good bets in this environment.Defensive stocks have already taken the lead in recent months. The XLP consumer staples ETF and the XLU utilities ETF have rallied more than 3 percent over the past three months, while the XLK technology ETF and XLY consumer discretionary ETF have fallen by at least 3 percent.Paulsen said a hard turn in the market, to favor defensive stocks over cyclicals, suggested economic trouble ahead, too.\"If defensive stocks are taking leadership, what's that say about upcoming economic growth?\" he asked. \"I think it suggests that economic growth is going to slow more than Wall Street really is ready for.\"The U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.9 percent in 2018, slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019, according to GDP estimates pooled by FactSet.Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.While some investors are avoiding homebuilders amid rising interest rates that traditionally serve as a headwind for the economically sensitive group of stocks, others say evidence is mounting for a bounce.A string of sell-offs in the past week has taken the S&P 500 down to critical levels. One technician now sees technical signs that a bounce could be coming.Shares of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia plummeted in after-hours trading on Thursday after its earnings report, but some see the name heading higher even as the group faces tariff-related vulnerabilities.\"I don't think that we'll see a recovery before the end of 2018,\" according to tech investor Paul Meeks.Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University, discusses China, trade and more with Mike Santoli.Yale University senior fellow Stephen Roach says the U.S. and China could make positive trade progress, but that fundamental problems remain.
