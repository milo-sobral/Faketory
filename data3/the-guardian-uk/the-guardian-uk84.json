He was also backed by the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who warned of a possible \u201ccatastrophic situation\u201d if the port was destroyed.\u201cThe fighting must stop, a political debate must begin, and we must prepare a massive humanitarian response to avoid the worst next year,\u201d he said.In France, the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said it was time \u201cthe international community said enough is enough. There will be no victor in this war.\u201dOn a day of intense diplomacy, Hunt first met with Saudi King Salman and the foreign minister, Adel al Jubeir, in Riyadh before flying to the UAE to meet Abu Dhabi\u2019s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Hunt then returned to Riyadh to meet the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who has a preference for late meetings.John Bolton, the US national security chief, also travelled to the UAE for talks.Hunt has combined his ceasefire bid with a call for the Saudis to do more to act on the findings of the Turkish investigation into the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashogggi, a critic of Saudi\u2019s rulers.Riyadh has now admitted that Khashoggi was killed in a premeditated murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. So far 15 members of the Saudi hit squad sent to Istanbul have been arrested along with three others. Five others, including four intelligence officials and a senior adviser to the royal court, were dismissed from their jobs.Hunt said he had spoken frankly with his Saudi partners and demanded accountability for those responsible for the killing and those who ordered it.He added: \u201cI was led to believe there will be rapid progress ... and the legal processes [are] going to start very soon indeed and we should hear something about that shortly\u201d.Asked if the UK had been given access to a secret Turkish audio tape of Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Hunt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on intelligence matters, but my understanding of what happened actually is not dissimilar to what I have read in the newspapers\u201d."}
