Berisha saved a long-distance drive from Armstrong before Bates had the ball in the net only to be ruled offside.However, the next goal arrived in the 67th minute when Fraser set up Forrest for the Celtic player to skip past defender Frederic Veseli and volley in from 12 yards.Substitute Scott McTominay, on for Armstrong, skimmed the bar with a left-footed drive in the 78th minute as Scotland dominated the bedraggled home side and they will now look for one big effort against Israel on what is set up to be a thrilling night at Hampden Park."}
