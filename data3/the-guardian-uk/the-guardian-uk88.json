Between 2015 and 2016, Canada resettled more than 25,000 refugees, many of them through private sponsorship programs.The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has publicly welcomed families fleeing conflict \u2013 even helping to hand out winter jackets at the airport \u2013 in stark contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s hostile attitude to refugees.On Monday, Trudeau retweeted Davies\u2019 footage, with the comment: \u201cAmazing \u2013 now convince them that shoveling is fun and you\u2019re all set. Thank you for everything you do, Rebecca. #WelcomeToCanada.\u201dDavies is a member of a group called Ripple Refugee Project, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars to help sponsor and resettle four refugee families from Syria and Eritrea in Toronto. \u201cWe were really touched by the video. We\u2019re very moved,\u201d said group member Andrew FitzGerald. \u201cThere seemed to be moments of pure joy coming from them.\u201dFor FitzGerald, the children\u2019s reaction to the snow cemented for him the importance of sponsoring families. \u201cIf people spent time with these families, they quickly realize these are very good people who are in difficult circumstances and need a hand.\u201dOne Twitter user commented: \u201cI hate snow. This makes me want to rethink my stance.\u201dDavies replied: \u201cI\u2019m hoping it also makes others \u2018rethink their stance\u2019 on the topic of newcomers and immigration.\u201d"}
