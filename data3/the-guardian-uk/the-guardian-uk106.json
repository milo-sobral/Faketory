The former captain made sure not to cause any embarrassment by revealing who he was talking about, though the DC United forward stressed that he has not been weighed down by any bitterness since his retirement from international football last year.\u201cI know there are some ex-players who I\u2019ve spoken to who can\u2019t come to terms with England doing well,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThat is wrong. I\u2019m not like that. I\u2019m a fan now. I want England to do well. I am proud to have played for England so many times and I always have been. I\u2019ve had my time. I am happy with what I\u2019ve contributed to the national team and I look forward now to the next few years and watching this team progress.\u201dRooney, who won his 120th cap as he made a farewell appearance during Thursday\u2019s friendly victory over the USA, tipped Southgate\u2019s young side to improve on their run to the semi-finals of last summer\u2019s World Cup. Yet it is clear from his remarks that not everyone shares his positive attitude. England\u2019s record goalscorer played in teams that rarely justified the \u201cgolden generation\u201d hype at major tournaments, with repeated failures leading to criticism of elite players such as David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and John Terry. That led many supporters to fall out of love with the Three Lions before Southgate\u2019s arrival in 2016.However, there was no hint of resentment from Rooney when he was asked if the current team is more worthy of acclaim. \u201cThe team I played in had superstars, but this team has also got superstars,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cHarry Kane, Raheem Sterling, John Stones \u2013 one of the best centre-backs in world football. England have got great players and they\u2019ve also got young players.\u201cI think this is a great squad, with other players who can come in if there are injuries. I have also seen first-hand that they are getting coached right, with good ideas, and the players are responding well to that. Hopefully this team can be the one to bring a trophy home.\u201cEveryone can see the potential in the team is huge. They have come off the back of a hugely successful World Cup, but in a strange way I think the game against Spain will give them even more confidence than what they did in the summer. That was a massive result, to win away in Spain. To be around the squad, to see how Gareth is coaching, was great.\u201dRooney\u2019s involvement against the USA gave him a chance to get a close look at Jadon Sancho, who sparkled on his first England start. The 18-year-old winger created Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s goal in the first half and showed no fear as Southgate\u2019s side warmed up for Sunday afternoon\u2019s Nations League game against Croatia with a comfortable 3-0 win.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by him,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cHe is a fantastic talent. I spoke to him before the game and he said he was nervous, which is normal, but the important thing for me was that he showed he isn\u2019t afraid to make mistakes. He\u2019s only 18. It happens. Of course you\u2019re going to make mistakes. I told him to have an impact and a few moments that people will remember \u2013 and he certainly did that.\u201dRooney laughed off a question about whether he feels envious of Sancho, who has impressed for Borussia Dortmund this season. \u201cI\u2019m not jealous,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fan now. I\u2019ve had my time. Are you jealous of me because I\u2019m younger than you? Of course I\u2019m excited for him. I\u2019m excited for all of them, I\u2019m excited for England. This is a great opportunity for this group of players to make that next step.\u201cThey\u2019ve already got to a World Cup semi-final, but they can\u2019t sit back and be happy about doing what the 1990 team did. They have got the potential to go further. This is a young group of players, but I can see the mentality is right and they\u2019ll be pushing for more.\u201d"}
