While our professional players, the foreigners we have in our team, don\u2019t get paid for playing for Japan.\u201cBut they do it because they want to play a high level of rugby that they don\u2019t get in Japan. Playing a team like England is a great opportunity. If you put that altogether we have got different motivators and we just want to get out and leave our footprint behind.\u201dJoseph also refused to get drawn into a war of words with the England coach, who joked at the weekend that Japan\u2019s team needed to \u201cgo to the temple and pray\u201d. However, he admitted his young team could be up against it at Twickenham.\u201cI am not sure we can run away from the big boys,\u201d said Joseph, who has given up coaching the Super Rugby side the Sunwolves to fully concentrate on the preparations of the national team before next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup on home soil. \u201cOne to 15 they are pretty big compared to our blokes. At the end of the day rugby is pretty simple, you have got to create momentum from set pieces and that is our first challenge and we are working on that.\u201cWhen we can do that we can score tries and we did that against the All Blacks and we have done it against tier-one teams, France, Wales. But we are playing at Twickenham and the players are going to experience a different style of footy. The game in England is very different to other parts of the world and we have a realistic opportunity.\u201dWith some key players absent, Joseph is expected to blood a fairly inexperienced team at Twickenham although the captain, Michael Leitch, who inspired Japan to their shock win over South Africa in the 2015 Rugby World Cup when Jones was in charge of the Brave Blossoms, is still in the lineup.\u201cThere was a real rugby fever after the World Cup because of the success of the team,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cThe majority of those players have moved on now so we have had to rebuild and bring new guys through. It has settled down but expectation internally in Japan is always high. Every team I have coached, there is always expectation to win. Externally, I don\u2019t think there are many in this country who think we can do it.\u201dJapan, who trained in torrential conditions on Monday, will need the weather to be fine to help their fast-paced phase play. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve got the ball and guys are really excited about playing, we\u2019ve got a different style of play; we\u2019re not as big as others, but we\u2019re quick,\u201d Joseph said.\u201cIn tough conditions it\u2019s tough to get our game going, so we\u2019re hoping and praying for a bit of weather. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to the temple though!\u201cWe don\u2019t want rain come kick-off time and I think we\u2019ve shown over the last couple of years if we can get our game going we can push teams hard.\u201d"}
