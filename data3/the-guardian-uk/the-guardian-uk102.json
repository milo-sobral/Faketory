We\u2019ve been so honored by the support that we\u2019ve received,\u201d Gillum said in a video statement. \u201cWe know that this fight continues, in spite of the outcome of this election.\u201dGillum posted a live video on Facebook on Saturday afternoon in which he congratulated Republican rival Ron DeSantis. Gillum had conceded to DeSantis on election night, but retracted it after the margin between the two candidates narrowed.The race went to a legally required recount, but after an initial machine recount DeSantis still led Gillum by more than 30,000 votes.Gillum, who is Tallahassee\u2019s mayor, isn\u2019t saying what he plans to do next. \u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said in his brief remarks. Nonetheless, Gillum says he will remain politically active, adding \u201cthe fight for Florida continues.\u201dGillum\u2019s announcement came hours after the US president, Donald Trump, said on Twitter that Gillum will be a \u201cstrong Democrat warrior\u201d and a \u201cforce to reckon with.\u201dCongratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with!There was no immediate response from DeSantis or his campaign.Not many experts expected Gillum to win the primary to become the Democratic candidate in hotly contested Florida. As the nominee, he faced a difficult fight in a state that Trump carried comfortably in 2016, but he frequently polled ahead of DeSantis for much of a campaign that became a symbol for a fight between a predominately white Republican party and a rapidly diversifying Democratic opposition."}
