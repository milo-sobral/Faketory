To work out what went wrong, ACIC referred the botched project to the auditor-general in February, asking that he investigate whether it was procured and managed appropriately.Internal correspondence, published on Thursday, revealed that the agency foreshadowed in July that it might make an application to the attorney general, Christian Porter, to suppress parts of the audit.The correspondence was unclear about precisely which audit ACIC wanted to redact, but the agency confirmed to Guardian Australia that it related to the biometric project.\u201cThe performance audit was initiated at the request of the ACIC,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe ACIC will not be commenting further on the audit process at this time.\u201d ACIC\u2019s correspondence came just weeks after Porter used extraordinary powers \u2013 for the first time in their history \u2013 to suppress parts of a report into the government\u2019s $1.3bn arms deal with multinational arms manufacturer Thales.Grant Hehir, the auditor-general, has previously warned that the Thales case might set a precedent that other agencies would follow to suppress his work.In the correspondence, ACIC chief operating officer Paul Williams told the auditor the agency might need to ask for the report to be suppressed if it contained sensitive information.Williams said one of the agency\u2019s considerations was to protect sensitive data that may be included \u201cinappropriately\u201d: \u201cLooking to the end of audit draft report process (s19 of AG Act) where comments can be made and if sensitive material is included inappropriately, consider applying to the A\u2010G [attorney-general Christian Porter] for a s37 certificate.\u201dSection 37 of the auditor-general\u2019s act allows Porter to redact audit reports on a series of grounds, including to preserve national security.\u201cI reiterate, this is not a matter of obstructionism \u2013 it is just us exercising our responsibilities so far as the protection of our data is concerned,\u201d Williams wrote to the auditor\u2019s office.The audit is due to be tabled in December. Hehir has used various forums \u2013 a parliamentary inquiry and Senate estimates \u2013 to point out that he regularly dealt with sensitive information involving defence and law enforcement. He said he had rigorous processes to ensure the Australian National Audit Office did not compromise national security or publish sensitive information.Porter said on Thursday that he was yet to receive any further applications to suppress audit reports."}
