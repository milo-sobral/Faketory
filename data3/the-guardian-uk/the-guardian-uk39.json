Entitled \u201cThe People\u2019s Project\u201d, it will seek views from the public, senior business figures and bodies such as English Heritage over the new stadium plus the future use of Goodison.The club intend to build community facilities at their historic home when they leave rather than sell the land and will submit an outline planning application for Goodison, together with a detailed plan for Bramley Moore, late next year.Despite securing a 200-year lease on the dock site in November last year, Everton have yet to reveal any stadium designs or confirm how the construction \u2013 which is expected to have a capacity of 50,000 to 55,000 \u2013 will be paid for.Liverpool\u2019s council announced the creation of a special purpose vehicle in March 2017 that would secure a loan of around \u00a3280m for Everton\u2019s plans and generate millions each year for the local authority in interest and security fees. However, the club \u2013 now majority owned by the billionaire Farhad Moshiri \u2013 are likely to raise the capital through private financial institutions.While the delayed planning application will almost certainly affect Everton\u2019s aim to start the 2022-23 season at Bramley Moore \u2013 2023-24 is more realistic \u2013 the club believe the wait necessary to improve the prospects of success. A rejection would leave them seeking yet another stadium site having spent millions preparing for Bramley Moore which, before Everton\u2019s interest, would not have been redeveloped for another 30 years by its owner, Peel Land & Property Limited.Colin Chong, Everton\u2019s stadium development director, said: \u201cWe know everyone is very keen to see images of what the stadium might look like and we look forward to sharing them next year. We will abide by a careful and considered process that respects all stakeholders\u2019 interests. This is a multi-faceted project and it is important that we do everything required to ensure our planning application, when it\u2019s made, stands the best chance of success.\u201cThe club has already carried out a huge amount of work to get us to our current position, making sure any scheme we develop is right for the club, the fans and for the city region as a whole. This is a long and methodical process and the public consultation forms an important part of this.\u201d"}
