He acknowledged that would prompt charges of nepotism but said he was \u201cnot sure there\u2019s anybody more competent\u201d.The same day the president said that, Ivanka Trump, who like her husband Jared Kushner is a presidential adviser, tweeted: \u201cIt is an honor to serve in the White House alongside so many great colleagues and I know that the president will nominate a formidable replacement for Ambassador Haley. That replacement will not be me.\u201dTrump has said he will consider Dina Powell, formerly deputy national security adviser in his White House. The ambassadors to France and Canada have also been reported to be under consideration.On Saturday, speaking to reporters in Elko, Nevada, after a campaign rally, the president said he was interviewing three women and two men for the position and would \u201cpick someone very quickly\u201d.Trump was asked: \u201cWould you prefer it to be a woman.\u201d\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick the best person. We are interviewing five people, three women, two men. I think I might prefer that, but we\u2019ll see.\u201dUnder Trump, working on national security and foreign policy does not convey job stability or a quiet life.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is the second man in that job, after Rex Tillerson. Former Bush UN ambassador John Bolton is Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, succeeding Michael Flynn and HR McMaster.In the same gaggle with reporters in Nevada, Trump announced that the US will withdraw from a 1987 nuclear weapons treaty with Russia."}
