{"id": "\nAt home and abroad, Emmanuel Macron ploughs lonely furrow\n", "paragraph": "\nSimon Tisdall\n\nSat 17 Nov 2018 21.41\u00a0GMT\n\nEmmanuel Macron\u2019s domestic difficulties and plunging approval ratings present a sharp contrast with his rising international profile. In a Europe lacking strong leaders ready or able to stand up to hard-right, populist nationalists at home and authoritarian regimes abroad, the French president cuts an exceptional figure. Or, at least, that is how he would prefer to be seen.As last weekend\u2019s gathering of more than 60 foreign leaders at armistice services and a \u201cpeace forum\u201d in Paris showed, Macron \u2013 France\u2019s youngest leader since Napoleon \u2013 is not without ambition on the world stage. Le Figaro suggested the elaborate ceremonies marked the start of an \u201cintense\u201d French global diplomatic offensive in support of democratic, humanitarian and multilateralist values.Macron has backed events to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2013 Human Rights Day is on 10 December \u2013 and is preparing to use France\u2019s 2019 presidency of the G7 to advance what he deems a progressive, internationalist agenda. He views May\u2019s EU parliamentary elections as crucial to stemming Europe\u2019s populist tide, and will actively campaign.Macron has already served notice on Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s anti-immigrant, anti-EU prime minister who was re-elected in a landslide earlier this year, that his ideas about \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d cannot stand. He has also targeted Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s far-right deputy prime minister. Nationalism and hate were spreading \u201clike leprosy all around Europe\u201d, he declared last summer.Such a robust defence of Europe\u2019s postwar social democratic order goes down well with centrist voters in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, where moderate parties of left and right have lost electoral ground. Macron frankly reviles France\u2019s Rassemblement National (formerly the Front National) and Germany\u2019s anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.But the issue is not as clear-cut as his fans might pretend. Europe\u2019s \u201cmainstream\u201d centre of gravity has shifted palpably to the right following the 2008 financial crash and large-scale refugee influxes. Orb\u00e1n has many allies among Polish, Czech and Slovak nationalists. His views are echoed in Sebastian Kurz\u2019s Austrian coalition, which includes the once-banned far-right Freedom party, and on the fringes of Angela Merkel\u2019s ruling CDU-CSU alliance in Berlin. Enduring support for Brexit in Britain reflects this shift.Orban has helped create a new normal inside the EU.\u201cOrb\u00e1n has helped create a new normal inside the EU, a situation in which the bloc faces a choice between trying to force illiberal governments to toe some sort of liberal line and compromising with them as an acceptable reality. There are indications the Brussels bureaucracy may be going for the latter option,\u201d wrote Bloomberg analyst Leonid Bershidsky.Macron\u2019s attempt to play Europe\u2019s champion is further undermined by claims that he is not quite the progressive he likes to appear. His own record on immigration is mixed, featuring border spats with Italy and Spain. His critics say he, too, harbours a haughty, authoritarian streak and that his neoliberal economic policies favour the better-off. Thanks largely to Merkel\u2019s slow eclipse and Italy\u2019s fiscal rebellion, his vaunted eurozone reforms appear dead on arrival.Macron\u2019s one-man crusade to save multilateralism and the rules-based international order, while praiseworthy in principle, looks similarly ill-timed \u2013 and ill-fated. His attempts to seduce the arch-nationalist and protectionist Donald Trump with a mix of Gallic charm and straight-talking seemed to work for a while. The two engaged in an embarrassing love-in at last year\u2019s Bastille Day parade.But all Macron\u2019s wooing \u2013 he was dubbed the \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d \u2013 failed to shift Trump on key issues such as climate change, Iran, and trade tariffs. Last weekend, Macron lambasted America First-style nationalism, as Trump looked on stonily. Suddenly, the \u201cbromance\u201d was over. Caustic Tweets mocking France\u2019s wartime record and jibes saying Trump lacked \u201ccommon decency\u201d ensued.The trouble is, where Trump leads, the world\u2019s current crop of like-minded authoritarian leaders, from Russia and China to Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, follows. Macron may be in the right. He certainly has history on his side. But is that enough? Abroad, as at home, he is treading a lonely path."}
