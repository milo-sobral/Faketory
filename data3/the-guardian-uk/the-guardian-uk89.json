The outspoken Benneteau told a French radio station: \u201cWith all that Federer is, OK. But it\u2019s an exhibition, his thing [promoted by his company, Team8]. The Laver Cup has no sporting legitimacy. There are no sporting criteria with the selections. There are no ATP points. It\u2019s just financial. Because he gives Nick Kyrgios $750,000 to come and play matches that don\u2019t count, the guys say: \u2018OK, those are the rates for the Laver Cup.\u2019\u201dThe conflict has divided players, with many of the biggest names \u2013 several of whom are contesting the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena \u2013 criticising the ITF\u2019s plans to move the Davis Cup final to November next year, and in a new World Cup-style format over two weeks. But there is a feeling abroad that this is a rush to judgment, driven by self interest.Alexander Zverev has been among the most vocal opponents of the change. The third seed said after beating Marin Cilic 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1) in their first-round match on Monday: \u201cI\u2019m not going to play Davis Cup in November [2019]. I am going to play [qualifying] in February in Frankfurt, I\u2019m going to do that. But the Davis Cup has some serious issues to think about.\u201cOne of them is the dates. I think the dates [are] very important and I think none of the top players will play, except Rafa [Nadal], because it\u2019s in Spain. I\u2019m very sure that a lot of top players will not play.\u201dAs for the perception that Federer gets to play when he wants to at big tournaments \u2013 invariably at night on the main court \u2013 Benneteau cites the Australian Open this year.\u201cOver the last two Australian Opens, he played 14 matches, because he was champion and finalist,\u201d Benneteau said. \u201cAnd he played 12 or 13 of them in the night session. On the same day Federer played Jan-Lennard Struff, Novak Djokovic played Ga\u00ebl Monfils. Any tournament director would put Djokovic-Monfils on the night session at 7:30pm, right? But no. They played at 2:30pm, in 104 degrees. And Federer-Struff played at night.\u201dCilic lost to Federer in that final, which moved under the roof on Rod Laver Court, and said here after losing to Zverev: \u201cRoger is very popular. Night matches are always something the tournament wants him to play. I was just not happy at the end of the tournament in Australia because they changed the rules.\u201dHe added: \u201cThey were following one way of the rules during the tournament and they had different rules for the finals with closing the roof. I don\u2019t think they were going one way or the other, for me or for Roger. I felt that they needed to be consistent.\u201dBenneteau sees it differently. \u201cIt\u2019s normal that he gets preferential treatment, with everything he\u2019s done,\u201d he told RMC Sport. \u201cBut, in some tournaments, there are big differences in the conditions. He has no idea what that\u2019s like.\u201dCertainly, Federer \u2013 who was unusually nervous losing in straight sets to Kei Nishikori on Sunday night \u2013 complained about having to hit on different surfaces this week, from Queen\u2019s to the centre court at the O2, but he chose not to practise at all on Monday in preparation for his match on Tuesday night against the other first-round loser, Dominic Thiem. This raised concerns that a hand injury he has been nursing since the start of the grass season might still be troubling him.On Monday evening Djokovic, reinstalled as the world No 1, confirmed his favouritism for a sixth title when he took just 73 minutes to beat the 33-year-old American Finals debutant, John Isner, 6-4, 6-3. From start to finish, he cruised, soaking up 13 aces and winning three of nine break points."}
