The email that suggests Banks attempted to solicit overseas donations for his unofficial Brexit campaign is likely to be published as evidence by parliament\u2019s inquiry into fake news on Monday.Banks states in the email that US citizens with British relatives could be targeted for donations, writing that a potential strategy should look at \u201chow we could connect to people with family ties to the UK and raise money and create SM [social media] activity.\u201dThe same email, written nine months before the EU referendum, also reveals that Banks would \u201clike to get CA on the team, maybe look at the first cut of the data\u201d, suggesting the firm may have been offered access to information about British voters from Banks\u2019s Brexit campaign, a claim denied by Banks.Cambridge Analytica closed this year after the Observer revealed it had harvested data on millions of Facebook users and engaged in \u201cblack ops\u201d political campaigns around the world. Banks told MPs in June that he had \u201cinitial discussions\u201d with Cambridge Analytica but didn\u2019t hire it \u201cor sign a contract\u201d.Damian Collins, chair of the parliamentary committee investigating disinformation and fake news, said the emails raised fresh questions about both the financing of the Brexit campaign and its use of data.The emails were submitted to the committee by Emma Briant, an academic at Essex University, who was given them by an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, Brittany Kaiser.Briant believes the emails suggest Bannon, who over the summer unveiled a Brussels-based foundation to help the spread of rightwing populism in Europe, viewed Britain as a \u201ckey entry point\u201d to influence European politics. Her evidence includes a chain of emails between Banks and employees of Cambridge Analytica, which was funded by US hedge-fund billionaire, Robert Mercer.Collins said: \u201cThe emails suggest that the role of Bannon and Mercer is far deeper and more complex than we realised. There\u2019s a big question about whether Mercer\u2019s money was used in the Brexit campaign and it absolutely underscores why Britain needs a proper Mueller-style investigation.\u201cThere are direct links between the political movements behind Brexit and Trump. We\u2019ve got to recognise the bigger picture here. This is being co-ordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we really haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added.In the 24 October 2015 email, sent to a number of recipients including Bannon, Banks refers to \u201cthree presentations\u201d they will make on 17 and 18 November to press, politicians and potential donors.Previous material published by the Observer revealed Banks and Leave.EU\u2019s Andy Wigmore met the Russian ambassador who introduced them to a Russian businessman with extensive business interests in goldmines inside the Russian embassy in London on 18 November.Briant told the Observer: \u201cThis chain of emails brings all these different threads and people together \u2026 here it is revealed starkly in hard documentary evidence that foreign funders and transatlantic interests and Ukip and Bannon and data and money are all being discussed. And it\u2019s really striking how their desire to influence politics and simultaneously make money completely overlap.\u201dBannon, Banks and Wigmore did not respond to requests for comment. "}
