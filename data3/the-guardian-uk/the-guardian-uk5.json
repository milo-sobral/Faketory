The previous review was in 2015.Adrian Meder, the sustainable seafood program manager at AMCS, said the salmon farming industry had been enabled to expand \u201ctoo far and too fast\u201d in Macquarie Harbour, on the state\u2019s west coast, where key players Huon Aquaculture, Tassal and Petuna lease several industrial fish pens.\u201cWe are supportive of sustainable aquaculture and this is an important source of seafood for Australia in the future, but it needs to be done within the bounds of which an environment can support,\u201d Meder said.He said the assessment was based on reported environmental impacts, including the dramatic falls in oxygen levels in the harbour that created dead zones on the seafloor, the loss of industry certification by key players Tassal and Petuna and the death of 1.35 million fish from pilchard orthomyxovirus, POMV, a disease exacerbated by environmental stress. \u201cIf the salmon is running out of oxygen, so is everything else.\u201dThere were additional concerns around the industry\u2019s detrimental impact on the rare and endangered Maugean skate fish and poor interactions with Australian fur seals.\u201cThose sorts of impacts are clear and indisputable signals that environment has been pushed too hard,\u201d Meder said.He said the group is also deeply concerned with the industry\u2019s plans to expand into Storm Bay and Okehampton Bay in south-east Tasmania.According to the latest figures published by the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association, the salmon farming industry is worth $1.12bn, and provides almost 3,000 jobs, directly or in support, in the state.In a statement, TSGA\u2019s chief executive, Dr Adam Main, said the industry was \u201cdeeply concerned at the misinformed and irresponsible assessment made by the Australian Marine Conservation Society\u201d.Main said the assessment failed to take into account improvements and investments made in infrastructure, environmental programs and biosecurity protocols, by all three companies within the last 12 months.\u201cThis includes substantial investments into seal-proof infrastructure across companies, to the tune of more than $160m between them; investments into multi-trophic farming to reduce environmental impacts and substantial funding of marine debris partnerships to further reduce impacts in waterways.\u201dMeder agreed the industry had improved recently but said they were yet to see the environmental impacts.Although a recent report by the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies found that dissolved oxygen levels in the middle and bottom waters of the harbour had improved due to favourable weather conditions and lower river flows over the last eight months, there had been little change to the low levels of fish recorded in the harbour in previous surveys.Main also claimed that AMCS had been invited by industry to visit in the last five years \u201cto no avail.\u201d Meder said he visited in June and met with representatives from two of the three companies, although he wouldn\u2019t name the companies.Meder said many of the issues had arisen because of a lack of government regulation. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some changes to regulation of the industry but certainly experts we trust still have serious concerns about the true independence of that regulation.\u201dWhen the downgrading was announced on Wednesday, independent MP Andrew Wilkie said in a statement that it was \u201cfurther evidence that the industry urgently needs to clean up its act\u201d. On Friday he said the aquaculture industry needed to be \u201cgenuinely sustainable\u201d because of its importance to Tasmania. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it will go the way of forestry and it will be Tasmanians, particularly those in regional areas, who will suffer.\u201dAccording to a statement from the Tasmanian government: \u201cThe Australian Marine Conservation Society is simply doing the bidding of the anti-industry Greens.\u201cTasmania has a sustainable salmon industry, and we have strengthened regulations and increased penalties for those organisations not abiding by the stringent rules.\u201dThe Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, is currently overseeing the primary industries portfolio after minister Sarah Courtney stepped down earlier this week. The shadow minister for primary industries, fisheries and water, Shane Broad, was contacted for comment.Meter said the AMCS would be open to reconsidering the assessment once the environment improved. \u201cWe want an industry as large as this one to be rating green in future.\u201d"}
