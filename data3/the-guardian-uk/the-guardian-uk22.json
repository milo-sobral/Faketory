Albert Stubbins, the previous quickest to 50 Liverpool goals, did so in 77 games between 1946-48. Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 also scored against Serbia\u2019s champions as Liverpool\u2019s victory, combined with Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s draw at home to Napoli, sent Klopp\u2019s team top of Group C.The Egypt forward has come under intense scrutiny during the start of a season in which he had struggled to recapture last term\u2019s phenomenal form. But after his sixth goal of the campaign, and latest Liverpool record, Klopp insisted Salah had delivered an emphatic response.\u201cI think he would say thanks to his teammates because it\u2019s quite difficult to score goals without these wonderful passes and crosses,\u201d said the Liverpool manager on Salah\u2019s half century. \u201cLike tonight, I have to watch it back, but I think the first goal he scored was just genius little linkup play from Shaq [Xherdan Shaqiri]. I don\u2019t know how he did that.\u201cIt\u2019s good that we can maybe stop talking about that. That will help a little bit. I was not in doubt, he was not in doubt, but if you are constantly asked about it then you think something is obviously wrong or people are not happy. You shouldn\u2019t be constantly be thinking about how you can score again. It only happens if you work hard, you are in the right spaces, if your team-mates see you in the right moments and if you make the right runs, then you can score. It\u2019s an exceptional number and hopefully he can continue. What\u2019s the next record he can reach?\u201dSalah\u2019s goal celebrations were restrained against the Serb side but Klopp said the forward\u2019s only issue was being substituted in the 73rd minute. The manager added: \u201cHe is completely fine. If he\u2019s not celebrating maybe he\u2019s a bit annoyed about getting asked about it. I saw him celebrating but I couldn\u2019t see his face from that distance. I know he is fine. I saw his face when I took him off. That was different.\u201dThe Liverpool manager also reserved praise for Fabinho, who impressed on only his second start since his summer arrival from Monaco. Klopp said: \u201cThe present for his birthday [on Tuesday] was not that he was in the lineup, it was that we played his favourite system with the double six. He played really well, good to see, very aggressive, everything was there. That was the start. Now he has to carry on.\u201d"}
