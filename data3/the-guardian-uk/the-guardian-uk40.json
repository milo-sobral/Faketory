Under the act, there is no obligation on the minister to explain their decision.The government announced on Wednesday that academics who wanted to apply for research council funding would have to explain how their proposed projects will \u201cadvance the national interest\u201d.The education minister, Dan Tehan, said a \u201cnational interest test\u201d would be introduced to the application process for all future Australian Research Council grant rounds.He said the government would provide $3bn in grants over the next four years, and the national interest test would \u201cimprove the public\u2019s confidence\u201d in why those grants are awarded.\u201cThe value of specific projects may be obvious to the academics who recommend which projects should receive funding but it is not always obvious to a non-academic,\u201d Tehan said. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking the Australian taxpayer to fund your research, you should be able to articulate how that research will advance the national interest.\u201cThe new national interest test will apply for all future grant rounds that are yet to open.\u201dA furore erupted last week when it was revealed in Senate estimates that the former education minister Simon Birmingham blocked 11 grants, worth $4m, in the humanities that had been approved by the Australian Research Council.Labor accused Birmingham \u2013 who is now the trade minister \u2013 of pandering to \u201cknuckle-dragging rightwing philistines\u201d, but Birmingham defended his decision.It was revealed that Birmingham disallowed $1.4m of discovery grants for topics including a history of men\u2019s dress from 1870-1970, \u201cbeauty and ugliness as persuasive tools in changing China\u2019s gender norms\u201d and \u201cpost-orientalist arts in the Strait of Gibraltar\u201d.He also blocked $1m of early career awards announced in November 2017, including a $330,000 grant for research into legal secularism in Australia and $336,000 for a project titled \u201cSoviet cinema in Hollywood before the blacklist\u201d.Birmingham said on Twitter last week: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure most Australian taxpayers preferred their funding to be used for research other than spending $223,000 on projects like \u2018Post orientalist arts of the Strait of Gibraltar\u2019. Do you disagree [Senator Kim Carr]? Would Labor simply say yes to anything?\u201dOn Tuesday, the Australian Catholic University joined other peak university bodies in expressing dismay at Birmingham\u2019s \u201cpolitical interference\u201d.Leaders of all 39 universities urged Tehan to follow expert advice and not exercise such a veto in future and to report to the public about such cases.\u201cI am deeply dismayed that the former minister for education would veto these expert recommendations by the ARC,\u201d the ACU\u2019s vice-chancellor, Greg Craven, said.\u201cHis political interference undermines the peer-review system, which is designed to ensure academic integrity. The secretive nature of the interference is particularly troubling.\u201dOn Wednesday Tehan said ARC grants ranged in size from $30,000 to $8m a year and he wanted to ensure taxpayers had confidence in how the money was spent.\u201cAcademic freedom and free speech do not require grant funding to exist,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment funding is only one source of research funding. If a project has merit it can also be funded directly by the university, from the private sector or other non-government sources.\u201cAs minister for education, I can guarantee the sector that I will be transparent in reporting ARC grant funding decisions.\u201cI have asked the ARC to add an additional category to the grant outcomes so applicants are notified of instances where a project is \u2018recommended to but not funded by the minister\u2019.\u201dUniversities Australia welcomed his decision to be more transparent about ministerial vetoes, saying it was a \u201cstep forward\u201d.\u201cWhile it doesn\u2019t abolish the ministerial veto power, the public and the researchers should know if a minister has rejected expert advice \u2013 so a commitment to public reporting is important,\u201d it said.Labor\u2019s innovation and industry spokesman, Kim Carr, told Guardian Australia that Tehan was ignorant of grant application process.\u201cThe very justification [Tehan] used for the measuring of the national interest, he said was about their impact, that\u2019s already contained in the application process,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minister is peddling ignorance and thinks that the government can spin their way out of trouble. It\u2019s crass cretinism.\u201dThe Australian Greens\u2019 education spokesperson, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, has also criticised the plan, asking how the government will define \u201cnational interest\u201d.\u201cWhen the Liberals and Nationals say national interest, we know what they really mean,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have such a narrow understanding of the importance of research in all fields, who knows what will be on the chopping block. Perhaps the minister would like to cut off research relating to trade unions, climate change or asylum seekers?\u201cA national interest test is a smoke screen for allowing the government of the day to insert their political priorities into the independent research approval process.\u201dWriting an opinion piece for Fairfax Media on Wednesday, the author of the paper that was ridiculed by Birmingham on Twitter last week, Roger Benjamin, explained what his research grant was about.\u201cMisquoted by him and in Senate Estimates, the full title of my 2017 project, was \u2018Double Crossings: post-Orientalist arts at the Strait of Gibraltar\u2019,\u201d Benjamin wrote.\u201cDouble crossing refers to the way painters and photographers crisscrossed the 15 kilometres of the most politically contested water in the world \u2013 Europe to Africa, Muslim to Christian worlds \u2013 in search of arresting images of other cultures.\u201cIt\u2019s ironic to see academic endeavours double crossed by a minister for education who dismissed them on the basis of a nine-word title.\u201d"}
