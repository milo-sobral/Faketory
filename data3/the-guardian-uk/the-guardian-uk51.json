Ashby Whitehead sprung from his bed and ran to his ute, hoping that his homemade booby traps had finally paid off.\u201cI\u2019d set up surveillance systems, a car alarm and tripwires but when it came down to it I wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch them,\u201d says Whitehead, an avocado grower whose orchards have been targeted five years in a row.It's hard to get your head around the things that happen for the sake of a fruit\u201cIt has moved on from opportunists to organised crime \u2013 they\u2019re not scared any more, they\u2019re so brazen, its just like money growing in the trees.\u201dThe global lust for avocados is driving a crime wave in New Zealand\u2019s Bay of Plenty, where orchards line the state highway heavy with fruit \u2013 and largely unprotected.Sold on the blackmarket for a dollar apiece, thieves can easily pick thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of fruit in one night. As demand has soared, gangs with links to organised crime in the nation\u2019s biggest city are using increasingly sophisticated methods to target the superfood, including scouring satellite images on Google Earth to identify unsecured orchards.On the back of the fruit\u2019s trendy reputation \u2013 and its popularity with millennials \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s industry is undergoing a phenomenal growth spurt, rising from a net worth of NZ$70m in 2013 to NZ$198m in 2017.In the off-season, avocados can sell for NZ$7.50 each in New Zealand supermarkets. But the avocado has become a victim of its own popularity, forcing farmers to take the law into their own hands to protect their crop.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the scarcity principle driving demand, but that\u2019s backfiring a bit now,\u201d says Ron Bailey, 78, an avocado grower in Te Puke for three decades.\u201cPeople have been intimidated and attacked, its got a fair amount of scale behind it now. There\u2019s a growing nervousness among growers \u2013 the thieves are getting bolder and pushing the limits.\u201dThere is no reliable data on the number of avocado thefts in New Zealand because police do not differentiate the fruit from other produce thefts, but anecdotal evidence suggests the crime is becoming more widespread and common.At least two people have been attacked by thieves on their orchards this season, and dozens of overnight raids have taken place on farms. The raids have been largely confined to the Bay of Plenty, though one Northland grower had 70% of his orchard pinched at a cost of NZ$100,000, according to reporting in the local press.Previously, avocado thefts have been treated as a bit of a lark, with reports of two elderly men robbing an orchard on their mobility scooters, and others using bed linen and garden rakes to nab their haul.But in the past two years the burglaries have become increasingly sophisticated \u2013 and increasingly dangerous \u2013 growers say, and they\u2019ve been forced to respond with inventive means of protecting their homes, orchards and livelihoods.Electric fencing, CCTV cameras and sensor lights have become standard security features of avocado orchards in the past five years, but homespun protection methods include armed night patrols in hotspots, electrified tripwires and booby traps hooked up to firearms that fire blanks.\u201cThe last five years it has just exploded, it\u2019s hard to get your head around the things that happen for the sake of a fruit,\u201d says Alistair Young, a director at Southern Produce, an avocado supplier in Te Puna in the Bay of Plenty.\u201cWe\u2019ve had more than a dozen incidents this season, and gangs coming back a second and third time once they realise they can get away with it.\u201dYoung has had two of his growers attacked when confronting thieves on their orchards. We haven\u2019t seen the worst of this, because we\u2019ve not yet reached peak avocado\u201cThey feel really invaded, it\u2019s quite frightening and dangerous to have people on your property right next to your home \u2013 bloody cowards. Soon this whole region will be side-by-side electric deer fences.\u201dSome fruit sellers and consumers are willing to turn a blind eye to criminal connections so long as their access to the green gold is guaranteed. Facebook has also become a prime outlet for selling hot fruit, police say, while some are offloaded at pop-up roadside stalls and at large produce markets in Auckland.According to industry body New Zealand Avocado global demand is growing 10% each year.Local growers \u2013 largely geared towards the valuable export market where massive expansion to Asia is planned \u2013 have been unable to keep up with the surge in appetite back home, where local avocados are the only option owing to strict biosecurity laws.When the veteran avocado grower Bailey and his wife visited California avocado orchards they were stunned to see 10 metre-high fences protecting the fruit, and more stunned when a local sheriff approached, asking what they were doing \u201ccasing out\u201d the trees.\u201cPolice don\u2019t have the time or the manpower here to race into the back blocks and chase down avocado burglars, so its up to growers to protect ourselves,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the worst of this, because we\u2019ve not yet reached peak avocado.\u201dIn response to calls for assistance by industry leaders, New Zealand police have ramped up their response to the avocado crime wave. Senior Sergeant Alasdair Macmillan says a number of prosecutions are proceeding through the courts.And it\u2019s not just fashionable avocados being targeted any more, says Macmillan \u2013 asparagus has started disappearing in \u201cepidemic\u201d proportions in the central North Island.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to encourage people to go to arms but the intensity and the scale of the avocado crime has definitely stepped up and we know that is extremely frustrating for growers whose livelihood is threatened,\u201d Macmillan says.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now with avocados is similar to how the honey crime started, and that has now reached enormous proportions, with millions and millions of dollars of honey and bees stolen.\u201dAshby Whitehead says it is astounding to see the power that a humble fruit can exert, and how the landscape of the Bay of Plenty has changed as growers try to protect the region\u2019s most valuable crop.\u201cI bought tents and put them in the orchards with torches on all night, I had fences, gates, security cameras \u2013 the whole nine yards,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cNothing stopped them.\u201cYou used to get shot for rustling horses, you don\u2019t get shot for stealing avocados. At least not yet.\u201d\u2018We are experiencing a substantial earthquake\u2019, the Deputy Speaker Anne Tolley says before asking people to clear the gallery in New Zealand\u2019s House of Representatives"}
