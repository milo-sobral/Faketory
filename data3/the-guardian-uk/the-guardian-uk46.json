The team behind the game in which you play a naughty goose takes Guardian Australia behind the scenes\nPatrick Lum\n\nTue 30 Oct 2018 22.32\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Tue 30 Oct 2018 23.22\u00a0GMT\n\nUntitled Goose Game has a very simple pitch: you are a horrible goose and your aim is to ruin everybody\u2019s day.\u201cWe thought this was a funny thing, with niche appeal,\u201d says programmer Nico Disseldorp of House House, the four-person Melbourne-based development studio behind Untitled Goose Game. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019d love a game about a naughty animal.\u2019\u201cWe completely underestimated that everyone else seemed to want the same thing.\u201dAfter their initial PC trailer became something of a breakout hit, House House found themselves blessed with internet goodwill, a publisher and enough resources to fund an additional version on Nintendo Switch \u2013 both due out in 2019 but previewing at PAX in Melbourne over the weekend \u2013 a fairly impressive feat for a game based on friend group in-jokes about a stock photo of a goose.\u201cWe don\u2019t have these geese experiences. We\u2019re complete outsiders,\u201d says Disseldorp. \u201cTo us, they might as well be a cartoon animal you don\u2019t actually ever see in real life.\u201dPeople think game development means you get to play games all day, but they're wrong - it means you talk about geese pic.twitter.com/I8XvTWy7b1While searching for ideas after their debut multiplayer game, Push Me Pull You, the team found themselves constantly joking about a hypothetical goose simulator, until they finally decided to just make the thing.\u201cThe idea of interacting with a bunch of people was there from the start,\u201d animator Stuart Gillespie-Cook says. \u201cYou have to have some feedback to get a good idea of how naughty you were being.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to just destroy stuff in the background \u2013 you want to show them what you\u2019ve done.\u201dWhile aspects of the gameplay remain familiar to traditional stealth fans \u2013 in some ways, it\u2019s reminiscent of a Hitman level: you begin by assessing the situation and figuring out how to manipulate the system to achieve your next set of objectives; you\u2019ll crouch in bushes, avoiding sentries and stealing small objects \u2013 the general vibe is much more low stakes and comedic, though no less entertaining. And, like many stealth games, confrontation often descends into farce. Perhaps the primary difference is in the focus not on power fantasy, but on the sheer, physical slapstick of seeing a beleaguered gardener run around a farmyard chasing a honking goose who has stolen his keys and won\u2019t let go.\u201cThere\u2019s probably more influence from clowning than from stealth games,\u201d says Gillespie-Cook, inviting comparisons to Looney Tunes cartoons or the films of Buster Keaton. Indeed, the game feels designed to encourage really getting into character \u2013 there\u2019s even a dedicated button for flapping your wings, which has no functional purpose at present but is nonetheless deeply satisfying.\u201cOne thing that was interesting to me was how many people tend to say \u2018the goose in your game \u2013 that\u2019s me!\u2019\u201d Disseldorp says. \u201cOr they\u2019ll tag their friends in a post or something and say, \u2018that\u2019s so you!\u2019.\u201cI guess a lot of people try and play games trying to be this cheeky no matter what, trying to be subversive, trying to bend the rules \u2013 so there\u2019s maybe something really appealing about a game where that\u2019s just your character from the get-go.\u201dUntitled Goose Game\u2019s aesthetic is based strongly on the quintessential sleepy northern English village. \u201cWe looked at the British TV shows we grew up with \u2013 Postman Pat, Fireman Sam \u2013 stop-motion, little diorama worlds,\u201d artist Jake Strasser says. \u201cThere\u2019s a vague sense of Englishness that we want to achieve.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of timelessness that I like to invite, too,\u201d Gillespie-Cook adds. \u201cThe ur-village, so to speak.\u201dBoth of House House\u2019s projects so far have been supported by Film Victoria, and the team credits the organisation with helping them set up the company properly. \u201cThey were very focused on making us sustainable and making us into a real studio,\u201d Gillespie-Cook says. \u201cEven the idea that a government body had faith in us was super important.\u201dDisseldorp says: \u201cThrough the entire production of Push Me Pull You, we didn\u2019t pay ourselves at all. Now we\u2019re able to hire other people, and work for ourselves.\u201dThe goose remains an object of fascination, with the team still trying to determine why exactly their naughty little waterfowl took flight. \u201cI think it\u2019s a question of attitude,\u201d Gillespie-Cook says. \u201cThey\u2019re a bit like magpies, really.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re somehow socially bad,\u201d Disseldorp says. \u201cBut also very, very silly.\u201d"}
