The company came out of the second quarter losing more than $100bn in market value as a result.Facebook has felt the fallout over data breaches and was held responsible for foreign intervention in elections and the spread of fake news, greatly affecting how users engage with the platform.Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which 50m Facebook profiles were harvested for data and used to influence the results in the 2016 US election of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign \u2013 widely seen as the largest data breach in history \u2013 Zuckerberg announced there would be big changes to the platform.\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can\u2019t then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a statement, published five days after the Observer broke the story. \u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\u201dIn the aftermath, the company tried to fix its privacy problems, along with its reputation. It tightened security on third-party app developers, updated privacy settings, required verification of identity from political ad-buyers, and teamed up with social science researchers. Facebook also announced the launch of a new \u201cwar room\u201d, designed to mitigate the spread of misinformation, earlier this month.Last week, the company announced that the war room team had detected and deleted 82 pages, groups, and accounts, all found to be part of an Iranian disinformation campaign targeting voters in the US and UK.While the company could not prove the pages were linked to the Iranian government, it was clear they were intended to \u201csow discord\u201d, addressing divisive topics, including race relations, support for Donald Trump, and immigration. The move followed a much larger take-down in the summer, when 684 fake accounts and pages with links to Russia and Iran were removed from Facebook and Instagram.But the moves may not be enough to quell the damage that has already been done \u2013especially if user growth rates continue to fall.In response to concerns about data privacy, the EU enacted regulations in May requiring tech companies like Facebook to better-protect user data. Legislation in the US is expected to follow, with big states like California already drafting changes in the law. The regulations, along with company-led changes, have already had an impact on how advertisers use the platform.This month, Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 by the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office over the scandal, which affected at least 1 million users in the UK. While the fine is tiny compared with the billions in revenue the company rakes in, the continued scrutiny over the way Facebook failed to protect user privacy has affected users\u2019 habits on the site \u2013 a much harder hit on the bottom line.In September, Pew Research Center reported that, over the past year, nearly half of Facebook users surveyed over the summer had taken weeks-long breaks from the platform after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twenty-six per cent said they had deleted the app from their cellphone altogether.\u201cThe reality is Facebook doesn\u2019t have a PR crisis. It has a trust crisis,\u201d Carys Afoko, founder of the feminist group Level Up, wrote in the Guardian this week, adding that she no longer uses the platform the way she once did. \u201cUsers like me don\u2019t trust the company to protect their privacy. We don\u2019t trust them to pay their fair share of tax. And we don\u2019t trust them when they say there won\u2019t be a repeat of the 2016 US presidential election.\u201dAhead of the call, the tech industry expert Beth Kindig anticipated that the hit on growth rates would be reflected in the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report.\u201cFacebook\u2019s growth rate trajectory was exponential because people found the network more rewarding when more people they knew joined the network,\u201d Kindig wrote on her blog. \u201cThe same will be true for Facebook\u2019s deceleration as well. As people start to spend less time on the social network, there\u2019s viral deceleration.\u201d"}
