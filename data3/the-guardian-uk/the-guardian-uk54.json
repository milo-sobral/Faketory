But it will fight the case at a Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal hearing next week in an attempt to avoid having to pay compensation for having to relocate her family.The Queensland shadow attorney general, David Janetski, said it was \u201chard to believe the lengths that this government has gone to cover-up for their own failures in this case\u201d.\u201c[The government] breached this poor domestic violence victim\u2019s privacy by leaking her details to her violent former husband and they should compensate her for that,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are trying to flex their muscle against her in any compensation claim in QCAT. The police officer involved may have been disciplined, but that doesn\u2019t bring the matter to an end.\u201dThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has previously told Guardian Australia it would be inappropriate to intervene in the matter while a case was before the tribunal. The attorney general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, would not comment on the case.But legal experts say that because the government is a party to the case it can easily choose to make a fair compensation offer to Julie, rather than seek to fight in the court system.Experts also say the state cabinet has oversight of the \u201cmodel litigant\u201d rules, which dictate how agencies are supposed to conduct themselves in legal matters. Those rules include provisions to ensure governments do not fight cases on technicalities, or take advantage of people who lack resources.Julie is self-represented in QCAT, which promotes itself as \u201cfair, just, accessible, quick and inexpensive\u201d. The government has been granted permission to brief a barrister at the hearing, despite any compensation being capped at $100,000.The police service has admitted during previous tribunal sessions that Julie\u2019s privacy was breached. A recent interim judgment in the case noted the fact her details were leaked was not in dispute. The government will fight the case by claiming it is not responsible for the actions of the individual police officer who accessed the data system and passed on Julie\u2019s address.Gabrielle Appleby, an associate professor in law from the University of New South Wales, told Guardian Australia the Queensland government\u2019s model litigant rules state that the government must not seek to take advantage of an \u201cimpecunious opponent \u2026 which might indicate that the government has acted in breach of this rule in this case\u201d.Appleby said governments took the position that model litigant rules were self-imposed, and therefore the responsibility of cabinet or the attorney general to police.Mark Thomas, a Queensland barrister and law lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, agreed that cabinet was responsible for oversight of how government agencies conducted litigation.\u201cThe foundational principles which give rise to the concept of a model litigant come back to the rule of law. It\u2019s not a long step from there to say the way [the government goes] about enforcing the law should meet certain standards.\u201dThe officer who leaked Julie\u2019s details was disciplined but not suspended, sacked or charged with an offence.He accessed her address from the police QPrime database and sent it to her former husband, who has been convicted of domestic violence and faces another charge of breaching a domestic violence order.Punchard sent text messages to Julie\u2019s former husband joking about the matter.\u201cJust tell her you know where she lives and leave it at that. Lol. She will flip,\u201d Punchard wrote in one message that was later sent to the Crime and Corruption Commission.* Julie is a pseudonym to protect her identity."}
