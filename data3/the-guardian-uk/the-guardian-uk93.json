As the franchise expands \u2013 Chabuddy has become a comic staple (he does the British Airways in-flight safety announcement), the fictional pirate DJs are currently touring live music venues, and there are plans for both a film version and a US remake \u2013 it\u2019s remarkable just how strong the original product remains. It\u2019s as funny, and as tragic, as ever. People Just Do Nothing may have earned its creators awards, critical acclaim and money, but success has not threatened Kurupt FM.In fact, as of the first episode, there is no Kurupt FM. Raided by the police during Grindah and Miche\u2019s wedding reception/rave at the end of the last series, the station is still off-air a year later. DJ Steves took the rap \u2013 probation and community service \u2013 a sacrifice that Grindah views through his own particular prism. \u201cSometimes the king has to be able to chuck away one of the little prawns,\u201d he says, \u201cjust so the whole team can eat, d\u2019you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\u201cCheck mate,\u201d says Beats.Actually, Steves seems to be taking community payback in his stride, planting flowers on a local roundabout while trying to interest his fellow parolees in jokes about hoes. It\u2019s Grindah and Beats who are not faring so well: they have been reduced to paying to perform their sets on arch-rival station Kold FM, which, in their eyes, amounts to complete humiliation. Chabuddy G, meanwhile, is romantically entwined with Miche\u2019s mum. \u201cIt\u2019s been a kind of crash course in sex for me, really,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I say crash, I mean literally.\u201d\u201cHe has got hurt a couple of times,\u201d says Miche\u2019s mum.On top of all this, Miche and Grindah\u2019s tower block is being demolished, and, having adopted the canny strategy of Just Doing Nothing, the only housing option now available to them is far from their Brentford home turf. \u201cWhat part of London is Essex in?\u201d Miche asks.Despite the setbacks, the crew\u2019s delusions of grandeur are still firmly in place, even as they resort to a car boot sale to try to raise enough money to buy new equipment. Grindah prices signed headshots of himself at \u00a380 each. When they finally manage to get enough stuff together to resurrect Kurupt, Grindah makes what he hopes will be a triumphant visit to Kold FM to resign his position, but the DJ in charge is merely bewildered. \u201cIs this because we caught you doin\u2019 a sit-down piss, yeah?\u201d he says.This cycle of idiotic hubris, crushing realisation and denial is the engine that drives People Just Do Nothing. All the main characters are deluded, wrongly believing themselves to be talented, sage and even honourable (excepting perhaps Chabuddy, who is proud to be thought of as \u201cdodgy\u201d). Cowardice stands in for cunning. Meanness masquerades as principle. Miche can\u2019t bring herself to put the words \u201cSad to see you go\u201d in the leaving card of a co-worker. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to lie on the card, cos it\u2019s written down, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she says.In different hands, such characters could become exasperating over five series, but their faults \u2013 and their manifest transparencies \u2013 are actually endearing. Their hardships may be largely of their own making, but they remain indomitable, and somehow sympathetic, throughout. And it\u2019s all achieved with magnificent subtlety: great explosions of overconfident bluster are undermined by a single sideways glance.In many ways People Just Do Nothing is more of a comedy for our age than it was when in first appeared in 2014. Back then it was bad enough that self-belief was considered the main ingredient of success. In the Trump era a more pernicious idea holds: that success can be conjured, like a mirage, from sufficient self-deception. This sort of thinking is at the centre of MC Grindah\u2019s cracked philosophy. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got goals,\u201d he says, \u201cyou don\u2019t need a job. If you know where your dreams are, then you don\u2019t need to live in reality.\u201dThat message should be depressing, but People Just Do Nothing transforms it into something a little bit joyous. Maybe it\u2019s just because it\u2019s funny, and we\u2019re all laughing at other people being so easily and so routinely deluded. Or maybe it\u2019s because self-delusion is all we\u2019ll have soon."}
