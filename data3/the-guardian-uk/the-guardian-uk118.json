French officials report that applications for French nationality have rocketed as the Brexit deadline \u2013 now four months away \u2013 has approached.In bars and cafes, Brexit was not the main topic of conversation in France, which has problems of its own. Pushed to express an opinion, the most common response suggested Britain had \u201cbrought this upon itself\u201d. \u201cMost of all, I feel sorry for my British friends,\u201d said Catherine in a cafe at Bastille in the centre of Paris.Across Europe people were genuinely perplexed about how the optimism of Wednesday, when it was announced the EU and UK had reached a deal, had turned to dust a few hours later.\u201cBrextremist putsch attempt\u201d the German tabloid Bild declared, as Theresa May struggled to maintain a grip on her government and her own political future.Writing on Spiegel Online, EU correspondent Peter M\u00fcller urged May to hold on, calling her \u201cthe lonely heroine of the Brexit theatre\u201d and praising her for having made the best of a bad situation.The agreement was \u201cof course not perfect\u201d, he wrote, but was within the \u201crealms of what was possible\u201d and was the best both sides could have hoped for.In Italy, a country which also has plenty of its own concerns, namely a wrangle with the EU over the country\u2019s 2019 budget, Brexit still made headlines. \u201cBrexit, nightmare of a midsummer night,\u201d wrote Enrico Franceschini, correspondent in London for La Repubblica.Many ordinary Italians were simply bewildered. Vezio Parpaglioni, an art dealer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s bad. We should be united, not trying to build walls like Donald Trump is doing.\u201dGoffredo Gattoni, a bar owner in Rome, said: \u201cEveryone around here is saying the same thing: it doesn\u2019t make sense for the UK to break away.\u201cWhat about Scotland, that wants to remain? Theresa May seems a very weak leader \u2013 not like the other one, Margaret Thatcher.\u201dThat opinion of May was far from universally shared, however. France\u2019s bestselling newspaper Ouest-France ran a leader sympathising with the prime minister, describing her decision to present the withdrawal agreement as \u201ccourageous and remarkable\u201d.\u201cIn accepting the European Union withdrawal agreement, Theresa May has put the greater interest of her country before that of her party and perhaps even her own. No one can imagine that a United Kingdom isolated from the continent can work in the long term and everyone knows that Europe without the UK will no longer really be Europe,\u201d it wrote.However it added the PM\u2019s choice was \u201cperilous \u2026 because it satisfies neither those who thought it was possible to break with 45 years of common life [with the EU] at the flick of a switch, nor those who hope for a second referendum.\u201cSince 23 June 2016, our cousins across the Channel have sought ways to leave the European project, whose aims they say they never shared. Their mistake, however, has been to believe that it would be possible do so and still profit from the benefits of European integration,\u201d ran the leader."}
