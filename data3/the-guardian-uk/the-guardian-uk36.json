The Europa League champions had conceded only five goals in nine Spanish League games.Hakimi, who joined Dortmund on loan for two seasons in the summer, pulled the ball back for Axel Witsel to break the deadlock for the home side in the 39th minute and sent it back into the centre for Raphael Guerreiro in the 73rd, 10 minutes before he set up England new-boy Jadon Sancho to seal the win with a tap-in.
