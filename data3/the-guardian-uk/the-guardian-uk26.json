Another, by environmental waste charity Hubbub, found that more than half (52%) of Halloween pumpkin buyers in the UK would welcome recipes to help them make more of the leftovers.Halloween is a significant money-spinner for supermarkets and is now second to Christmas in terms of festive retail. An estimated 10m pumpkins are grown in the UK every year, 95% of which will be hollowed out in lanterns for Halloween and the rest used in recipes. Some pumpkins are inedible and specified as \u201cfor ornamental use only\u201d but the flesh of the majority is edible. Suppliers say this year\u2019s erratic weather has led to many larger-than-average pumpkins.\u201cHalloween has become increasingly popular in the UK, but unlike those on the other side of the pond, many Britons aren\u2019t cooking with their pumpkin carvings \u2013 instead they\u2019re throwing them away,\u201d said Tessa Tricks of Hubbub. \u201cThis is contributing to the overwhelming amount of waste thrown away by UK households each year.\u201d\u2022 Read more of the Guardian\u2019s pumpkin coverage"}
