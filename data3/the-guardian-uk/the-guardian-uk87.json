The CSIS researchers said the base was still being maintained and improved, and was one of 13 it had identified out of an estimated 20 in total.The existence of the bases does not represent a violation of the agreement Kim made with Trump at the summit, which involved vaguely worded pledges on the \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d, which Pyongyang interprets as a gradual, staged and reciprocal process of disarmament.\u201cThe CSIS report does a great job identifying missile operating bases that analysts have long suspected. The fact that they have been maintained and improved, however, does not mean North Korea is cheating or deceiving the United States \u2013 Kim said he would mass-produce ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads in his New Year\u2019s Day speech this year, and that is exactly what he is doing,\u201d said Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Seoul\u2019s presidential Blue House played down the latest research, according to Yonhap news agency. Spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said information about the Sakkanmol missile base had come from a commercial satellite. \u201cThe intelligence authorities of South Korea and the US have far more detailed information from military satellites and are closely monitoring [the base],\u201d Kim said.Trump used the nuclear agreement to promote himself as a peacemaker ahead of the US midterm elections earlier this month, pointing to the absence of nuclear and missile testing over the past year. He has said sanctions would stay in place until North Korea disarmed, but that he was \u201cno rush\u201d to force the pace of disarmament.For the time being, Pyongyang appears to sticking to a self-imposed moratorium on testing in return for a pause in US military exercises with South Korea which Trump ordered after the Singapore summit. But there are signs that bargain may be beginning to fray. The North Korean regime has warned it could resume its nuclear development work if sanctions are not lifted.On Monday, state-controlled media said that small-scale military drills by a few hundred US marines and South Korean forces represented a violation of a summit agreement between Kim and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.North Korea abruptly pulled out of planned talks with Pompeo in New York last week, and have so far not sent a delegation to talk to the newly appointed US envoy for North Korean talks, Stephen Biegun. Pyongyang said however that it is still interested in pursuing talks and describes Trump as being a more amenable interlocutor than other US officials.\u201cI think Kim still wants to get to a second summit, and so does Trump, on the hope that Trump is more likely to provide relief and concessions than Pompeo is,\u201d Narang said. \u201cSo I think they wait to see if they can get to a second summit before doing anything provocative like resuming testing or a space launch. If the second summit blows up, then maybe we see a resumption of testing and fire and fury.\u201d"}
