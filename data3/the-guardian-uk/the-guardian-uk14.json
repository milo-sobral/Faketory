It was the biggest outpouring of public opposition to government policy since the anti-Iraq war protest in 2003.The number who descended on the capital to call for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d exceeded all expectations of both the organisers and police. Addressing the crowds, which included dozens of MPs from all political parties, the TV personality and food writer Delia Smith said Brexit threatened to cause \u201cunmitigated chaos\u201d.\u201cThe only way we can avoid this total madness and win back our future has to be a people\u2019s vote,\u201d she declared to loud cheers.The Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said the march showed that British people were beginning to realise that politicians could not deliver a successful Brexit that would protect their jobs, livelihoods and their children\u2019s futures. They were afraid of the havoc that would ensue, and wanted a chance to stop it.\u201cPeople have woken up to the potential disaster,\u201d Cable said. \u201cWe\u2019ve realised there isn\u2019t a good deal coming out of this and a lot of people are frightened, people are worried.\u201dThe march coincided with a call from a senior government minister for Tory MPs to drop their \u201cideological obsessions\u201d over Europe, which he said were now threatening to drive the country \u201coff a cliff\u201d.Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, the de facto deputy to foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, said Conservative MPs and ministers now had a duty to show people they could deliver a sensible, moderate Brexit that was in the national interest. But this would never be achieved if so many remained entrenched in different ideological camps and refused to compromise.\u201cThere simply is no ideal outcome that will suit everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to step back from their ideological obsessions and accept a pragmatic compromise. Otherwise we risk inflicting on ourselves massive economic damage, as well as political damage, domestically and internationally, for years to come.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis is the biggest \u2018get real\u2019 moment of my political life. The fate of our country for decades will depend on this. It is as if we are driving towards a cliff, but won\u2019t face up to the reality that the road we have chosen will take us over the edge.\u201dThis weekend, however, there was no indication that Tory infighting over Brexit was subsiding. Theresa May is being warned by pro-Brexit cabinet ministers that they will vote against any deal she proposes unless they see legal guarantees that Britain can make a clean break in the future from the EU. Ministers including Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Michael Gove are among those with concerns that moves to solve the Irish border issue could tie the UK to the EU for the long term. Tensions are expected to surface at this week\u2019s meeting of cabinet ministers and a key gathering of May\u2019s inner Brexit cabinet on Thursday.With May\u2019s authority on the wane, Eurosceptic MPs and donors have been openly discussing the prospect of installing David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, as a short-term leader. A leadership challenge is triggered when 48 Tory MPs submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, demanding a contest.The Observer has spoken to MPs considering submitting their letters this week. \u201cIt is entirely possible that Brady will be making an announcement this week \u2013 that is how bad things are,\u201d said one MP. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the last week has rightly reopened questions about the leadership.\u201dDemonstrators on the march brandished placards saying \u201cParliament\u2019s divided, the people must decide it\u201d, \u201cWhy the lies, Boris?\u201d, and \u201cTime for an EU turn\u201d.John Bramich, who made a four-hour car journey from Stockport to take part, said: \u201cWe hold a general election to choose a new government every five years or less. Brexit is something far more important. Saying that it\u2019s undemocratic to hold another vote on it is nonsense.\u201dRodolfo Hermans, a Chilean-German national and nanotechnology researcher at University College London, who joined the demo, said: \u201cThe climate towards immigrants such as myself has become terrible. This atmosphere is a true hostile environment, and it is affecting not just those from the EU but people from across the world.\u201dA Downing Street source said there would be no second referendum: \u201cWe had a people\u2019s vote in 2016. A second referendum would really be a politicians\u2019 vote \u2013 politicians telling the people they got it wrong the first time and should try again. That would do lasting damage to faith in democracy.Another pro-remain rally took place in Northern Ireland on Saturday, which converged on Belfast city hall. The crowd, waving EU flags and carrying anti-DUP placards, heard Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, describe the EU as a force for peace.She said the Brexit debate was not about protecting the UK\u2019s union or creating a united Ireland, as it has been characterised by some on opposite sides of the issue.Long said: \u201cThis is about the people of this place coming together and saying, just like the EU, we value cooperation, we value immigration, we value working together in the best interests of everyone in this society.\u201cThat is why we value the EU, it is not just a model of cooperation, it underpins the very cooperation that we need here.\u201d A pro-Brexit counter-protest in Harrogate, organised by Nigel Farage, was attended by roughly 1,200 people."}
