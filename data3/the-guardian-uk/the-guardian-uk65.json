Marcus Rashford\u2019s stoppage-time winner at Bournemouth on Saturday earned a third Premier League victory in four matches and provides a lift before this week\u2019s match at Juventus and the Manchester derby on Sunday.Smalling described it as a pivotal period for United and insists the value of victory in upcoming matches is priceless. \u201cI think that it would galvanise us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going into a very tough week now but we can come out with some good results and it can be seen as a good month. It is an especially tough month now and potentially after the international break when we have a lot of home games it\u2019s all about making sure we get results and move up that table despite the tough games.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mourinho was livid with his side\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d first-half performance and Smalling \u2013 who described that 45 minutes as their worst this season \u2013 has urged United to eliminate any sloppiness in Turin on Wednesday or risk being punished by the Serie A leaders.\u201cIn the last few years I think we have been known for shutting up shop and not conceding many goals so this season has been very unusual to what I have experienced,\u201d Smalling added. \u201cWe need to work on that because normally we don\u2019t concede many and we win the game. It starts at the back, and as a team collectively, and we will be working on it every day.\u201dPaulo Dybala scored the only goal of the game as Juventus outclassed United at Old Trafford last month, but Smalling insists he and his teammates will arrive buoyed after recording another late win.\u201cWe can take the second half to Turin and I think we will be more on the front foot and you will see a better performance in the first half. We need to take the second-half performance that we had against them at home and we need to do that from the off and we\u2019ll give them a good game and get chances.\u201dRashford and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, against Newcastle United, have both scored stoppage-time winners in recent weeks, which has also led to comparisons with Ferguson\u2019s reign, during which his team often prospered late on.Asked if such comebacks reminded him of playing for the Scot, who signed Smalling from Fulham in 2010, he said: \u201cYes, we\u2019re showing that attitude, never giving in. No matter how bad the first half was, the second half we all believed we could go and win. It\u2019s a great feeling and it\u2019s bringing us closer together. As games are getting tougher and tougher \u2013 I think they\u2019re closer than ever \u2013 it is often coming down to fine margins. Who can give that added burst in the last five minutes? We\u2019re going to win a lot of points that way, and a lot of other teams are going to gain or lose points that way.\u201dSmalling recognises that United\u2019s indifferent start has left them with an uphill task in order to attain a top-four finish but he knows any criticism comes with the territory. \u201cWe as players have to stand tall and the spotlight will be on us because we are supposed to be in the top four. We are doing everything we can to get there, the 28-year-old said.\u201d\u201cTo be at a club like this, and last as long as I have, you need to have that courage and belief in your ability, because you\u2019re not going to have good days every week and the bad days are often highlighted when you\u2019re at a big club, but I believe in myself. As players you need to have thick skin and we need to have belief that you will have bad days but it\u2019s about making sure you have more good days than bad.\u201d"}
