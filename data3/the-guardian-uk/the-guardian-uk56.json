There aren\u2019t any railings. I was not about to get that close to the edge. But she seemed comfortable. She didn\u2019t seem like she was in distress or anything.\u201dMatteson said his girlfriend, Drea Rose Laguillo, noticed that Moorthy had been captured in their images on Monday after pictures of the two victims were published.Matteson said he doesn\u2019t recall noticing Viswanath when he and his girlfriend were at the overlook with less than a dozen other tourists. The couple left the overlook as darkness was approaching, Matteson said.The Indian couple\u2019s funeral will take place in the US because the bodies were not in a condition to be flown back to India, Jishnu Viswanath said.The couple was \u201ctravel-obsessed\u201d, Moorthy wrote on a blog called Holidays and HappilyEverAfters filled with photos of them in front of snowy peaks, the Eiffel Tower and tulip fields. Moorthy had wanted to work full time as a travel blogger, Viswanath said.\u201cA lot of us including yours truly is a fan of daredevilry attempts of standing at the edge of cliffs and skyscrapers, but did you know that wind gusts can be FATAL???\u201d Moorthy wrote on an Instagram post with a photo of her sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon. \u201cIs our life just worth one photo?\u201dThe couple graduated in 2010 from the College of Engineering, Chengannur, in the Alapuzha district of Kerala state, one of their professors, Dr Nisha Kuruvilla, told the AP.She said Moorthy and Viswanath were both good students who were fond of traveling and had married at a Hindu temple in Kerala in southern India four years ago.A Yosemite spokeswoman, Jamie Richards, said in a statement that park officials were investigating the deaths and that the investigation could take several days.In India, after a rash of selfie-related deaths, the tourism ministry in April asked state government officials to safeguard tourists by installing signs in areas where accidents had occurred declaring them \u201cno-selfie zones\u201d.\ufeff"}
