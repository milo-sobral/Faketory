He\u2019s getting better\u2019\nNick Miller at the Emirates Stadium\n\nSun 4 Nov 2018 23.03\u00a0GMT\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 4 Nov 2018 22.30\u00a0GMT\n\nJames Milner was the man who scored Liverpool\u2019s goal in their 1-1 draw with Arsenal on Saturday and, according to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, it was also the midfielder who offered some stern words to fire up his team at half-time.Milner gave Liverpool the lead just after the hour mark, only for Alexandre Lacazette to equalise in the latter stages. But while the game was a fun, intense contest for the neutral, the Liverpool manager spent much of the first half in a state of agitation, unhappy with what he deemed a substandard display from his team.\u201cYou have a compact formation, you force [Arsenal] to pass the ball somewhere \u2013 that\u2019s pressing, it\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cThe best way is to do it right from the first moment and then you can build on that, but we didn\u2019t do it right from the first moment. That means there\u2019s a time that it\u2019s not there and we all felt like, \u2018What the heck is here?\u2019\u201cMilly was the one who saw it first and was quite \u2013 how can we say, was not happy \u2013 was animated. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s how it is in a dressing room, there is a lot of men, a lot of testosterone. One is talking \u2013 that\u2019s me \u2013 and sometimes before I start talking the boys have a few words and that\u2019s all. Milly is a proper leader.\u201dLiverpool continued their record of never losing a game in which Milner scored, and while the summer arrivals of Naby Ke\u00efta and Fabinho might have suggested the 32-year-old\u2019s days as a regular starter were numbered in the team, he has been among their best players this season. \u201cMilly is like wine,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cA very good red one. I\u2019m not sure if Leeds is famous for wine? He\u2019s getting better. I think he should buy all of the newspapers and read this. I would like it if you write a story about James Milner.\u201d Klopp then shifted from appreciation to heavy sarcasm. \u201cObviously someone might write that he [should] play for England again. That\u2019s a really nice idea.\u201dWhile Liverpool were eight minutes away from a valuable victory, Klopp agreed a draw was a fair result, but Milner admitted their failure to win was frustrating. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 1-0 up in a game like that you need to see it out and we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are positives. Coming away from Arsenal and being disappointed with a draw is a positive, and also the amount of chances we created. It\u2019s always going to be tough against them.\u201dThe draw briefly took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League, before Manchester City\u2019s victory over Southampton on Sunday moved Pep Guardiola\u2019s side two points ahead. \u201cYes, and I do,\u201d said Klopp, when asked if he has to ignore City\u2019s relentless accumulation of points.\u201cActually, I\u2019m not interested in how many points Man City gets. They have one from us [the 0-0 draw at Anfield], if they get 89 more I have no influence on that. I\u2019m not interested, no.\u201d"}
