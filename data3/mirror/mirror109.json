The talent show judge sobbed following Danny's emotional performance of Frank Sinatra's My Way, which appeared to remind the star of her father.Turkish advertising executive Haldun Evecan died of a heart attack at the age of 68 in 2014 just years after reconciling with daughter Ayda.\u201cDanny I know you love me, but I love you more,\u201d Ayda said on Saturday's live show.\u201cI know my dad is up in heaven and he's picking up that phone for you.\u201cAnd I hope all of Bradford, all of the UK picks up the phone for you because you had the moment of the show and I'm so proud of you.\u201dAyda previously opened up about her dad's shock passing.She said: \u201cI will never forget how the world swallowed me up on that day when I found out.\u201dAyda's father is said to have left she and mother Gwen Field when the future star was just three years old.Haldun moved back to his native Istanbul and went on to start a new family, which includes Ayda's half sisters Ilgi and Oyku.Ayda is said to have had no contact with Haldun until she was 18 years old, though reports suggest that he had fought a legal battle to see his daughter.The star flew to Turkey to meet him when she was 26, and later shared an emotional phone call with him ahead of her 2010 nuptials to pop star Robbie Williams.Meanwhile, Ayda wasn't the only X Factor judge touched by Danny's rendition of the Sinatra classic, with Mr Nasty himself, Simon Cowell, even giving him a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek.Show boss Simon said: \u201cI want to say directly to your face, Danny, I didn't like last week's performance. This week I thought you were amazing.\u201cAnd you deserve everything \u2013 you're a great guy.\u201cI actually felt very emotional during that.\u201cYou are a total star for that.\u201d"}
