He granted her bail but banned her from contact with her son.Wilkins is due to be sentenced on December 6.Wilkins denied assaulting her child causing grievous bodily harm with intent on September 22, 2016.That was the day the boy\u2019s head was smashed against a hard surface in the flat the parents once shared in College Avenue in Mutley.She also pleaded not guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm between August 31 and September 3 in 2016.Her trial would have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds.A jury unanimously found her guilty on both counts after seven hours of deliberations.The exact events which ended in the boy, who cannot be named by court order, in hospital will never be known.The jury found that Wilkins attacked her son several times, fracturing his ribs and then pointing the finger of suspicion at Mr Vanselow.She finally banged his head against a heavy object while she was alone in the flat for 90 minutes on September 22, 2016.Wilkins said nothing of what happened and the parents only took him to the GP \u2013 who immediately phoned for an ambulance."}
