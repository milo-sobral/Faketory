Then, she was the subject of her own media storm when it was suggested she had 'disappeared' with Pete Wicks during a boozy night out. But Megan insists their relationship is still \"really good\" and \"going from strength to strength\". \"It\u2019s really good, his PA run has come to an end now and he\u2019s getting ready for Dancing On Ice so it\u2019s all really positive,\" Megan who is the new brand ambassador for PrettyLittleThing exclusively told Mirror Online. And she's not worried about the Dancing On Ice curse after Kem Cetinay split from his Love Island girlfriend Amber Davies while taking part in the show last year.\"I think if anything we\u2019re going to have more time together because when he\u2019s travelling to his PAs he's halfway across England.\"I think if anything once he\u2019s got his Dancing On Ice schedule it\u2019ll be better and if anything we\u2019ll have more time together so it\u2019ll be nice.\"But is Megan worried about Wes' head getting turned by the dancers on the show?\"No I don\u2019t think so he\u2019s so completive he\u2019ll be more interested in how good he is and if he\u2019s better than the other people on it,\" she said.And she revealed she doesn't feel any pressure to stay together.\"I think if we cared so much about what the public think we wouldn\u2019t have played Love Island how we did it,\" she reasoned.\"He could have played it safe with Laura, I could have played it safe with Eyal, so I think we\u2019re very much focused on our careers and each other then you can\u2019t think about how other people are going to perceive it.\"Ultimately if we\u2019re not happy then we\u2019ll end it but we have a really good time so you can\u2019t put that much pressure on it and think: \u2018Oh we should do it for the public.\u2019\"She added: \"We don\u2019t put a lot on social media, documenting our whole relationship.\"We\u2019ll put something on from a night out if we\u2019re think we\u2019re being funny but we\u2019re quite private and I think that helps a lot and I think we\u2019re on the same page with making the most of the opportunities we\u2019ve been given while building our relationship.\"It\u2019s still early days in our relationship. I never would have thought I would have come out with a boyfriend and moved in with him after three months.\"Last night, things could have got a little awkward on the red carpet as Megan and Pete narrowly avoided each other as they made their way into the Pride Of Britain Awards.Megan, 24, looked fantastic in her green gown which showed plenty of shoulder.Meanwhile Wes didn't seem concerned by the rumours and looked razor sharp in his black suit and loafers.The Sun reported that there were questions to be answered about the boozy night the Animal Hero Awards at The Grosvenor House Hotel last month.But lips were sealed on the red carpet and awkward reunions avoided.\"Megan and Pete hit it off from the moment they first started talking \u2013 they both seemed keen to get to know each other better,\" a source said.\"At first Pete was very cautious and made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested due to her being in a relationship with Wes. But as the night progressed they\u2019d both had a lot to drink and were having fun.\"The pair even went \"missing\" for a long period of time from the rest of the group that included Ferne, Mario and also Jon Clark... Megan loves Wes so has insisted to close friends that nothing happened between her and Pete.\""}
