{"id": "Liverpool prepared to sell Fabinho to fund \u00a370m Christian Pulisic move", "paragraph": "The Reds are battling Premier League rivals Chelsea to land the Borussia Dortmund and USA starLiverpooL boss Jurgen Klopp is determined to win a \u00a370million battle with Chelsea for USA sensation Christian Pulisic.Pulisic was the stand out player for the Americans in Thursday\u2019s 3-0 Wembley defeat to England. Klopp has been aware of the 20-year-old\u2019s potential ever since the attacking midfielder joined his former club Borussia Dortmund almost four years ago.Before leaving Dortmund Klopp had asked the kid from Pennsylvania to link up with the first team for some training sessions.And since becoming Liverpool manager Klopp has watched with keen interest as the 20-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise.But now with Pulisic\u2019s contract running down in 2020 and, with talks of a new one having hit an impasse, it appears that Dortmund will reluctantly be forced to cash in on one of the brightest young stars of the Bundesliga.That has triggered interest across Europe, although it appears Chelsea have become Liverpool\u2019s biggest rivals for Pulisic\u2019s signature.But an Anfield source said: \u201cHaving watched Christian develop there is no way Jurgen is going to back off now. He knows he is a talent who can light up the Premier League.\u201dAny transfer could be subsidised by the departure of Brazilian Fabinho who has failed to make an impact since joining in the summer for \u00a343.7m from Monaco.It\u2019s why Liverpool could consider cashing in early on the midfielder with interest from AC Milan and Juventus."}
