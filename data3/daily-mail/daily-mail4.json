{"id": "Trans Corbynista who was born a man lands top women's role", "paragraph": "By\n\nGlen Owen for The Mail on Sunday\n\nPublished:\n  19:52 EST, 20 October 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  21:02 EST, 20 October 2018\n\n           2View  commentsA Jeremy Corbyn supporter who was born a man has been appointed as a Labour women\u2019s officer \u2013 despite being embroiled in a furious row for making shockingly offensive sexual remarks to a political colleague with opposing views on trans rights.The storm blew up after the Corbynista, who self-identifies as a woman, used Twitter to tell one campaigner to go \u2018suck my big lady c***\u2019.After the target of the abuse made a formal complaint to Labour, the abuser was defended by their local party as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 and promoted to the new position which involves encouraging women to join the party and speaking up for women\u2019s issues.A high profile follower of Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of making disgraceful comments on Twitter\u00a0The case has led to fury among feminists, who say that any non-transgender man who made the same remark would have been severely disciplined.The extraordinary dispute comes amid a growing row within Labour over whether transgender individuals should be allowed to stand on all-women shortlists. A Government consultation over whether the Gender Recognition Act should be amended to allow people to legally change gender by self-identifying \u2013 removing the need to go through a long medical process \u2013 closed on Friday.It has triggered a bitter debate between feminists and transgender activists over whether transgender women, who were born male, should be placed in the same category as biological females.The Corbynista targeted another Labour campaigner on the \u2018trans spectrum\u2019 for distributing leaflets that questioned on safety grounds the decision of the Girl Guides to accept boys who identify as girls and allow them to sleep in the same rooms.The alleged abuser told the leafletter on Twitter: \u2018Guess what legally I am a woman and there is f*** all you and your #terf mates can do about it. Lol so go suck my big lady c***.\u2019The transgender activist, who is known to Mr Corbyn, has angered party feministsTerf, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist, is used as a derogatory term to describe those who believe that \u2018identifying\u2019 as a woman is not the same as being born a woman.The Mail on Sunday is choosing not to identify either the Corbynista or the victim.The message recipient says that despite complaining about the remarks two months ago, Labour has not only refused to take action \u2013 it made the abuser a women\u2019s officer.\u2018If a biological male had sent such tweets to a woman they would be facing severe disciplinary or expulsion from the Labour Party and possible criminal proceedings. I feel that Labour have normalised such behaviour for trans people on the grounds of politically correctness.\u2018Jeremy Corbyn should personally see that the standards set out by Labour NEC as regards party members bullying and harassing must be upheld.\u2018As an individual on the trans spectrum myself I do understand women\u2019s concerns about changes to the Gender Recognition Act\u2019.The abuser\u2019s local party said last week that it had \u2018received communications\u2026 relating to historic comments made on social media by a vulnerable member\u2019, adding that \u2018now that this member has been elected as an officer, the local party will be supporting this member in their new role, including reviewing expectations regarding conduct on social media\u2019.The Corbynista women\u2019s officer said: \u2018I have had a colourful life and I don\u2019t deny that but\u2026 I do regret that comment and others I made to him because I lowered myself to his level.\u2019\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have been moderated in advance.\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
