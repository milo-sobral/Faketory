Petrol is the ultimate grudge purchase. Everyone has got to buy it and it is causing real pain out there,' he said.\u00a0While he shifted responsibility to petrol companies to 'do the right thing', Caltex CEO Julian Segal reminded customers 'a significant portion' from sales went 'into Scott Morrison's pocket'.'There are real reasons why these prices have gone up and that simply is crude prices have gone up significantly and the Aussie dollar has gone down,' he told The Australian Financial Review.'You should also remember a significant portion of every dollar that the customer pays is going into Scott Morrison's pocket in the form of excise, for example,' Mr Segal said.Meanwhile, Liberal MP Craig Kelly called on the Government to slash its excise and drive the cost of petrol down 10 cents per litre.\u00a0Scott Morrison\u00a0 (pictured) warned retailers on Monday the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would be 'watching them', and dismissed calls to reduce fuel exciseThe $12 billion a year fuel excise adds an extra 40 cents to the cost of every litre and is levied by the government and used to repair roads and fund infrastructure\u00a0The\u00a0$12 billion a year fuel excise\u00a0adds an extra 40 cents to the cost of every litre and is levied by the  government and used to repair roads and fund infrastructure.\u00a0Petrol costs have skyrocketed across the nation, with prices in Sydney hitting an eye-watering $1.75 a litre on Monday, Melbourne hitting a 10-year high last month, and Adelaide motorists forking out an average of $1.67 a litre.Queensland MP Luke Howarth accused retailers of profiting from the price, arguing 'most of the price is going to retailers at the moment'.Caltex however suffered a $20million blow to its retail earnings in the September quarter relative to its run rate in the first half.Mr Sims welcomed the ACCC's scrutiny and said he doubted  it would be successful in finding anything of a damning nature.More than 160,000 Australians pledged to boycott petrol stations in a day-long strike on Friday October 26 protesting against rising fuel prices.While many people took part, it was discovered the movement made little difference, prompting the development of a plan to boycott\u00a0BP and Shell service stations for the rest of the year.\u00a0Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
