Thankfully, our officer was not seriously injured.'In August New York Mayor Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled plans to replace the notorious Rikers Island jail complex with four smaller lockups located in densely populated neighborhoods.The plan includes turning an Art Deco government building that went up in lower Manhattan in 1930 into a tower for up to 1,500 inmates.\u00a0The announcement comes six months after officials decided to shut down Rikers by 2027 after years of complaints about violence by guards and gang members, mistreatment of the mentally ill and juveniles and unjustly long detention for minor offenders.New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio announced plans to replace the\u00a0 Rikers Island complex (pictured) with smaller correctional facilities located in densely populated neighborhoods\u00a0Advocates for the closure also have argued that the island facility near La Guardia Airport - accessible only by a narrow bridge - is too isolated, cutting off inmates from the outside world in a way that hinders oversight and rehabilitation.\u00a0Daily populations at Rikers have fallen to about 8,200 a day and could reach as low as 5,000 thanks to reduced sentences for low-level offenders and other criminal justice reforms, officials said.They said the lower inmate populations have made dismantling the complex and replacing it with the smaller facilities, each with 1,500 beds, more viable.\u00a0Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
