It is simply not in conformity with our procedures, and we have a Second Reading of a Bill.\u2019The Speaker then hurried up Somerset Tory MP Rebecca Pow, who was brought up on a farm owned by Prince Charles, telling her to speak \u2018very briefly please\u2019 as she prepared to make her tribute.But later, Mr Stephenson \u2013 whose official title is Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty\u2019s Household \u2013 is understood to have complained about the Speaker in a letter.This is collected by a messenger each evening, taken to Buckingham Palace and apparently read by the Queen before dinner.A well-placed Tory source said: \u2018Her Majesty has been kept fully informed of what\u2019s happened in the Commons Chamber with respect to that particular debate.\u2018I\u2019m sure the Speaker meant no disrespect to the Royal Family but a number of people had wanted to speak and in a debate like that, he should have exercised some discretion.\u2019Mr Stephenson could not be reached for comment last night.Former Labour MP Janet Anderson, who served as Vice-Chamberlain in 1997-98, lifted the lid on the normally secret communications in her Dear Queen book two years ago.\u00a0Last night she said: \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a private letter between you and Her Majesty, and Mr Stephenson can really put what he likes in it.John Bercow, far left, was at the centre of a \u2018respect for the Royal Family\u2019 row last night after being accused of cutting short Commons\u2019 tributes to Prince Charles on his 70th birthday\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s a special messenger waiting at 6pm to take it across to Buckingham Palace.\u2018And the Queen reads it each evening before dinner.\u2018Tony Blair told me once that the Queen loved my letters. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s because I used to give her all the gossip\u201d.\u2019Ironically, one of Mrs Anderson\u2019s letters referred to Mr Bercow when he was simply a Tory backbencher as a \u2018tiresome little man\u2019.Last night, Mr Bercow denied cutting short the session devoted to marking Prince Charles\u2019s birthday. His spokeswoman pointed out that the day after, he went to the Prince\u2019s Clarence House residence to deliver formally the Commons\u2019 tributes.She said: \u2018It is not true the debate was cut short.\u2018Everybody who wanted to speak was able to do so.\u2018The Speaker was able to offer His Royal Highness his own birthday wishes the following day when he joined a celebration at Clarence House with the Prime Minister and leader of the Opposition.\u2019A spokesman for the Palace declined to comment last night.\n\t    Share what you think\n          No comments have so far been submitted.
