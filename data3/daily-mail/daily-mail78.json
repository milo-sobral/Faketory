I don't know what happened between the two of them but I just thought Candeias was lacking a wee bit of class in doing what he was doing.'Watching images of Candeias offering little or no response to Samson, followed by Ferdinand placing his arms around the Portuguese winger's shoulders, Gerrard said: 'So Daniel gets a second yellow card for that? Be serious? What does he get a second yellow card for?Rangers boss described the decision to send the Portugal man off as 'embarassing' afterwards'The second yellow card is embarassing. There's your evidence, that's what you're dealing with.'With little or no clarity as to why Candeias was *actually* sent off, Samson shrugged: 'I've got no idea why he got a second yellow card. All I know is, you don't need to act like he was, rubbing it in and showing a complete disrespect to your opponents.'Anton obviously wasn't happy because of it. I don't know what the two of them said to each other to actually make Candeais get sent off, but there was no need for him to do what he did. He had already won the game - just go and shake hands. You don't need to rub it in like that.'The Gers winger scored a stunning long-ranged effort to open the scoring earlier in the gameAlfredo Morelos netted their second in the dying moments of the game to seal the pointsPublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
