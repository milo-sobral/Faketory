In a daring break, he sprinted across an exposed 800 yard stretch to reach a 25-pound field gun.The gun usually required three men to operate it, and by the time he reached it Labalaba was soaked in blood from a bullet wound to his jaw.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prince Harry and wife Meghan walked the red carpet at Nadi airport to their awaiting Qantas charter flightThe Duke and Duchess bid farewell to Fiji as they boarded a flight to the nearby Pacific Island nation of TongaThe royal couple are spending just one night in Tonga before heading back to Sydney, Australia for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games\u00a0But the elite soldier, still under heavy fire, spun the cumbersome weapon to face the advancing guerrilla fighters and opened up from close range, decimating them.The Duke of Sussex unveiled a memorial for a British-Fijian soldier who died at the Battle of Mirbat as the royal couple departed Fiji for Tonga.Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba, of the Special Air Service, single-handedly held off 250 insurgents with a 25-pounder field gun after being shot in the jaw during the battle in Oman in 1972.The Duke of Sussex unveils a statue in honour of Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba in Nadi, FijiHe was part of a nine-strong SAS team based outside Mirbat when they were attacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG).Sgt Labalaba was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his bravery in battle.For a year the unit had been on a secret assignment, code-named Operation Jaguar, to protect the Sultan of Oman from the insurgent force.Sgt Labalaba was noted for his bravery in battleOn the morning of July 19, 1972, 250 of the Front's best fighters stormed the port in a surprise attack that left the nine SAS men pinned down inside their fort.Sgt Labalaba, 30, knew that without heavier fire power, the unit faced almost certain annihilation.He sprinted across an exposed 800-yard stretch to reach a 25-pound field gun, which would usually require three men to operate.Ignoring his wounds he continued to hold off the 250 Front fighters for six hours.In SAS: Operation Storm, a book recounting the battle, fellow trooper Roger Cole wrote that the fight would surely have been lost had Sgt Labalaba not taken the 25-pounder.Sgt Labalaba is an enduring legend among Fijians, 1,250 of whom are currently serving in the British Army.\u00a0Ignoring his wounds he continued to hold off the 250 Front fighters for six hours.Captain Mike Kealy and comrades Tommy Tobin and Sekonaia Takavesi also ran the 800 yard gauntlet to try to save the courageous sergeant's life.They arrived too late, but Labalaba had held off the guerrilla force long enough for the Sultan's Strikemaster jets to arrive.The jets drove back the attackers while reinforcements from nearby Salalah were organised.In SAS: Operation Storm, a book recounting the battle, fellow trooper Roger Cole wrote that the fight would surely have been lost had Labalaba not taken the 25-pounder.The sergeant was posthumously awarded a Mention in Dispatches for his bravery, and his body was returned to England, where it was buried at St Martin's Church in Hereford.A statue to the war hero was erected at the SAS headquarters outside the town in 2009.Labalaba is an enduring legend among Fijians, 1,250 of whom are currently serving in the British Army.The soldier's son, Isaia Dere Labalaba, 53, was at the ceremony and spoke of his pride that Prince Harry would be unveiling his father's statue.'I'm so excited, so happy today. I last saw him (my father) in 1971 when he left for his tour of duty. He was meant to come home again within days when he died. I was just four years and 11-months-old,' he said.\u00a0'He was a really family man, my father. I am very excited to meet Prince Harry. It is a great honour that he has agreed to do this.'His comrade Sekonaia Takavesi\u00a0Wakolo, 75, was with Labalaba when he died and was himself shot in the shoulder by a bullet that just missed his head.'We were blood brothers, we stood side by side. It was the last day of our five month tour.\u00a0'We had some rum to celebrate the night before and had packed our belongings and gone to sleep before the handover,' he said.\u00a0'It was 4am when the attack started. We thought it would be just another skirmish and they would hear back into the mountains. But it wasn't and we were outnumbered.'He added how 'we have campaigned for a long time for a statue to commemorate him'.\u00a0'It is wonderful to have a memorial to him here in Fiji. It is very important to The Fijian people,' he said.\u00a0'We were very proud to serve the Crown so it means a lot to us to have Prince Harry here to unveil it.\u00a0'His brother Prince William unveiled a statue on Hereford in 2014.
