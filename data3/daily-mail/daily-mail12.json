You cannot have any speaker from the Right because they are more likely to attract protests.Mr Rees-Mogg said the association had been 'bankrupted' and needed an emergency auction to raise the cash'This is really hostile to freedom of speech. If the university does not provide basic security for visiting speakers, what are students paying their fees for?'He suggested charging students for security would make it almost impossible to have elected MPs as their speakers.Bristol University hit back last night, saying it was 'firmly committed to upholding freedom of speech as well as ensuring events are conducted safely'.It said there had been 'safety concerns' about Mr Rees-Mogg's visit and that BUCA had been made aware of that and the \u00a3496 cost.\u00a0A spokesman said: 'Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the professionalism of both security and police on the evening.'\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
