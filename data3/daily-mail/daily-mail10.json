Jack was probably a bit short on fitness when he got here so that took a few weeks, but he loves practising and he's improving because the more you practice, the more you improve.Lampard believes  Marriott could have a 'big future' after his late strike at Pride Park'He wants to practice after training every day and sometimes I have to hold him back . Other days I don't because I love seeing that, and to see him do it makes me realise that if he keeps doing it he's got every opportunity to have a big future.'Derby caught United cold from the kick-off when a six man move was finished from 15 yards by Bryson with only 18 seconds played.But United regrouped to dominate possession and equalised in the 41st minute when John Fleck went through Derby's defence on the left and cut the ball back for Chris Basham to fire into the roof of the net.Craig Bryson scores Derby's first goal of the game inside a minute on SaturdayIt was a different story after the break as Derby started to stretch United and they went close several times before Marriott won it with a quality finish in the 77th minute.Craig Forsyth whipped the ball to the near post and Marriott got in front of a defender to steer a shot across Dean Henderson.United almost replied when Scott Carson dropped a cross and Jack O'Connell's header was cleared off the line by Mason Mount.Blades manager Chris Wilder said: 'It's a great result for Frank and Derby and a poor one for us.Chris Basham pulled one back for the visitors shortly before the half-time intervalBasham celebrates as the Blades looked to extend their gap at the top of the table'It was a tight game between two really good sides and they found their moment..'Derby were better than us second half. We lost control of the game a little bit but I thought we were really good in the first.'We were really good and should have found that last bit to go in at half-time up in the game, but we didn't and they came back.'I've no complaints about the second half and the result overall because if you defend like that and don't put teams to bed the result can go either way.'Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
