Because as 'society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality becomes wider.' We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.\u00a0Men's higher drive for status\u00a0We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.\u00a0Status is the primary metric that men are judged on[4], pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail.\u00a0Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n      Trump stands in the devastating ruins of Paradise and takes a tour of neighborhood incinerated by worst wildfire in state's history as more than 1,000 people are feared missing and death toll hits 74\u00a0\n    \nPublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
