They took their chances and we didn't take ours.'There is a lot of water to go under the bridge before the World Cup. You will make them favourites, so go ahead. As of now they are the number one team in the world.A smartly executed play sees Jacob Stockdale race over for the first and only try of the game'We are one of the challengers. England, Australia, Wales, South Africa - everyone who goes to the World Cup will be.'But what we do know is that Ireland will go there reasonably confident. And they should, they have a good side. We will too, as we have a good side.. England will say the same thing.'I am very proud of our guys too. You couldn't knock the effort even if the execution was not as good as we would have liked - we got beaten by a better team.New Zealand-born centre Bundee Aki celebrates after helping Ireland make a piece of history'When you get beat it hurts. It is quiet, sombre and people are gutted. It is how it should be when you get beaten.'Hansen was seen passing his adversary Joe Schmidt a parcel before kick-off - and the Kiwi boss revealed it was match tickets.'It was 760 Euros,' he said.'I bought some tickets - he was the only bloke I could buy them from. If you buy them you have to pay for them, so I got that out of the way early.'\u00a0\n\t    Share what you think\n          No comments have so far been submitted.
