He said: \u2018As a parent, I want my children to enjoy swimming as part of an active lifestyle, and as Education Secretary, I want to make sure our children grow up safe and water-confident.\u2018That\u2019s why I wanted to partner with the Independent Schools Council to get more private schools to offer up their pools, teachers or training to their neighbouring local state schools.\u2019Mr Hinds added: \u2018Many independent schools are already doing this but others can and must do more to help every child in their community. And as these partnerships develop, I hope to see some healthy competition between and within schools so that children can not only have the health benefit of swimming, but the team spirit and personal development that comes from competitive sport.\u2019Education Secretary Damian Hinds has called out for the new initiative\u00a0Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: \u2018Swimming is a life skill which helps develop fitness and for many people leads to a lifetime of enjoyment.\u2018We are happy to join the Secretary of State in promoting awareness and encouraging more of these schemes across the country so that children from all kinds of schools can enjoy the health benefits of swimming and can be safe in and around water.\u2018The recent sporting success the country has enjoyed in terms of both swimming and triathlon shows what can be achieved if people learn to swim well at a young age.\u2019Department for Education officials said about half of the council\u2019s 1,335 members who have swimming pools \u2013 304 out of 603 \u2013 share their facilities with other schools, as well as some offering coaches to primary schools.Nearly three-quarters of primary schools use public facilities, with the others using their own or another school\u2019s pool.\u00a0Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
