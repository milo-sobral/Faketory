The party\u2019s canvassing activity in marginals has been \u2018ramped up massively\u2019 in recent weeks, sources say.But Tory MPs\u2019 anxieties about another General Election \u2013 less than two years after the disastrous campaign that lost the party its Commons majority \u2013 will not have been eased by three new polls released this weekend.One for Opinium carried out on Wednesday \u2013 as Cabinet Ministers argued over the deal in a marathon meeting with Mrs May \u2013 put the Conservatives at 36 per cent, with Labour leapfrogging them to reach 39 per cent.Just a month earlier, Opinium had the Tories on 41 per cent and Labour on 37. Ukip have risen two points to 8 per cent, while the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats have dropped one point to 7 per cent, in a sign few voters are agitating to overturn the referendum result.Another poll published last night, carried out by Panelbase, put the Tories and Labour neck-and-neck on 40 per cent each.A third poll, carried out by ComRes on Wednesday and Thursday, had the Tories dropping three points to 36 per cent, with Labour remaining on 40 per cent.Nervous Tory MPs will recall that they were enjoying a 20-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party at the start of the ill-fated 2017 Election campaign.\u00a0\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\u00a0Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual  We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
