Kupp returned to that game for one series but sat out the rest and was deemed week-to-week.\"He was in really good spirits,\" McVay said. \"And just from talking to him, you can tell that he's feeling a lot better than maybe what initially those first few days after that game [in Denver].\"Stewart was penalized and fined $26,739 for the tackle.Kupp had 30 catches for 438 yards and five touchdowns through five games this season before going catchless in Week 6 and missing last week's blowout win over the San Francisco 49ers.The Rams don't have their bye week until Week 12. After hosting the Packers on Sunday, they'll visit the New Orleans Saints in Week 9.--Field Level MediaSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
