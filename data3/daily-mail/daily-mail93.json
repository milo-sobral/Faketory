So I go to Spain to do Love Island and I'm going to do a travel special with [best pal] Oscar [Gordon] in Italy, and fly straight back and freeze them,' she said.\u00a0The process of freezing eggs begins with eight to eleven days of injecting a thin needle filled with a fertility hormone into the soft tissue of the lower stomach.\u00a0Chic: The blonde beauty showed off her trim pins in a cleavage-baring striped dress and open-toe heelsEggs are then collected with an ultrasound-guided tool that is inserted into the vagina, and once frozen, the eggs can be stored for many years.In an interview with A Current Affair in February, Sophie said that she was still determined to start a family despite breaking up with former Bachelorette winner Stu Laundy, who she previously thought was 'The One'.'I'd love to [have kids] because I know they'd be so loved.
