At almost \u00a3300, it\u2019s expensive, but worth it; I haven\u2019t yet found a miracle cream that does the job as well. But I would never again get fillers \u2014 I tried them once when I turned 50, but I looked like I had golf balls in my cheeks!LUSCIOUS HAIR PREPI\u2019ve always been known as \u2018the girl with all the hair\u2019. However, it has thinned a lot since I hit the menopause. To keep it healthy, I apply Rene Furterer\u2019s Karite Hydra Hydration Shine Mask (\u00a322.95, allbeauty.com) every two months, or a week before a special occasion. It makes such a difference that my hair is almost too soft!Veronica Kumeta, 58, (pictured) revealed her top tips for maintaining a youthful appearanceTRY MICROBLADINGEyebrows are crucial for framing the face. However, mine have become much sparser with age. I get regular microblading to fill in the gaps and add definition. It is a form of semi-permanent make-up, where tiny hairs are tattooed into the skin. It cost me \u00a3300 for the initial treatment, then \u00a3150 for the annual top-ups (beautissima.com).GOODBYE MEDITATIONI found having hobbies far more beneficial for my mental wellbeing than any meditation. Last year, I founded a charity choir called Surviving Voices & Friends to help women battling breast cancer. We practise every week and have even released a cover of Lean On Me on Amazon (99p, amazon.co.uk). I lost several friends to the illness, so it feels good to be making a difference and helping people.BARGAIN BUYSI would always much rather invest my money in regular beauty treatments than spend it on clothes. You can dress up anything to make it look expensive.\u00a0Do you look good for your age? reveal your secrets to inspire@dailymail.co.ukPublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
