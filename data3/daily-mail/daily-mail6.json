{"id": "There are over 9,000 foreigners in British jails... so why do we deport just ONE a day?", "paragraph": "By\n\nBen Ellery And Andy Gardner For The Mail On Sunday\n\nPublished:\n  19:50 EST, 20 October 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  03:44 EST, 21 October 2018\n\n          94View  commentsTheresa May's\u00a0pledge to clear bursting prisons by kicking out foreign criminals has been exposed as a sham by new figures revealing that just one convict a day is being deported.At the current rate, it would take decades before those scheduled for removal among the current foreign prisoner population of 9,066 are actually sent home.According to official figures, just 1,583 have been removed from the UK in the past four years, despite the UK having agreements with about 70 countries to send them home. It makes a mockery of a promise in 2016 by Mrs May, the then Home Secretary, to crack down on the problem.\u2018Foreign nationals who commit crimes here should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them,\u2019 she said in response to a Select Committee report about the difficulties clearing the backlog.But officials are still failing to kick out many of the criminals before they complete their sentences, meaning they are released on to the streets to commit more crimes or simply vanish.The Government admitted last year that it had lost track of almost 500 overseas nationals who were facing removal from the UK after serving prison sentences for their crimes during the previous two years.Data obtained under Freedom of Information rules show a total of 494 foreign national offenders \u2018absconded\u2019 while they were subject to deportation action from 2014 to the end of March 2016.The Mail on Sunday last week revealed that Yaqub Ahmed, a Somalian whose deportation was halted after a mutiny among airline passengers, was a convicted gang rapist.Yaqub Ahmed, 19, was jailed for his part in luring a teenage girl back to a Crouch End flat and gang raping herYaqub Ahmed, centre, during the confrontation on the Turkish Airlines flight at HeathrowLike Ahmed, many of the foreign prisoners who have escaped deportation have been convicted of violent offences. And many have gone on to commit fresh crimes following their release.They include Iranian Noureden Mallaky-Soodmand, 41, who was arrested for carrying knives in London but escaped deportation. He is serving a four-year jail term for running amok with a knife, screaming: \u2018I am ISIS and my people will cut off your b****, Christians.\u2019In another case, convicted sex offender Mansor Fatholli, 46, who should have been booted out of Britain, was later caught in a drugs den with bags of cocaine and more than \u00a33,000 in cash.And Abdi Waise, 28, an illegal immigrant from Somalia who was served with a deportation order in 2013 after being given eight years for raping a 21-year-old woman, is back behind bars for trying to kidnap and molest four schoolchildren.When she was Home Secretary, Theresa May pledged to crack down on the problem\u00a0The figures also reveal a steep rise in the number of Albanian nationals clogging up British jails. The country has jumped from fifth place to second with 742 criminals, compared to 492 the previous year.Poland remains top of the list with 822 prisoners, down from 965 in 2016. Ireland is third with 720 inmates, down slightly from 762 in 2016, and Romania is fourth with 644 of its nationals behind bars.The figures do not relate to foreign offenders who have completed their sentences and are in the process of being deported.Under current legislation, all offenders from outside the EU jailed for more than 12 months are referred for automatic deportation. In most cases, criminals from the EU can also be deported after two years, or one year if the conviction is for a sex attack.However, criminals can appeal \u2013 placing a huge financial burden on the UK \u2013 or in many cases they simply abscond while awaiting deportation.Glyn Travis, assistant secretary of the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said: \u2018The large number of foreign nationals in our jails adds to the pressure on a creaking system.\u2018Prisoners from different cultures and backgrounds have their own requirements and our members strive to help them on a fair and equal basis.\u2018However, given the financial cuts and staff reductions, it is becoming harder and harder to make things work.\u2019Last night the Ministry of Justice said it had removed nearly 6,000 foreign offenders last year and more than 44,000 since 2010, a figure that includes convicts deported after being released from prison.A spokesman said: \u2018This Government does all it can to deport foreign criminals while they are behind bars or once they are released.\u2019\u00a0Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
