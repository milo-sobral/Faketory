Church groups provided portable showers, bathrooms and sinks.The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.Rivera said 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on October 13 and that he hopes more will make that decision.'We want them to return to Honduras,' Rivera said, adding that each migrant must weigh whether to go home, appeal for asylum in Mexico or wait in line to apply for asylum in the Us.\u00a0The Mexican Interior Ministry said Friday that 2,697 Central American migrants have requested asylum in Mexico under a program that the country launched on October 26 to more quickly get them credentials needed to live, work and study in southern Mexico.Central American migrants wait in line for a donated breakfast at a temporary shelter in TijuanaA Central American migrant boy eats a donated breakfast at a temporary shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, early on Saturday morningHonduran migrant Mauro Hernandez rests inside a makeshift tent at a temporary shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, early Saturday morningThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.Tijuana officials said they converted the municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces.\u00a0The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000 and as of Friday night there were 2,397 migrants there.Some business owners near the shelter complained on Saturday of migrants panhandling and stealing.Francisco Lopez, 50, owns a furniture store nearby. He said a group of migrants took food from a small grocery a few doors down, and he worries that crime in the area will rise the longer the migrants stay at the shelter.Other neighbors expressed empathy.\u00a0'These poor people have left their country and they're in an unfamiliar place,' said Maria de Jesus Izarraga, 68, who lives two blocks from complex.Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week's elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim new criticism at the migrants.'Isn't it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving ... their country's flag. Can this be possible?\u00a0'Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it,' Trump said in a pair of tweets.\n\t    Share what you think\n          No comments have so far been submitted.
