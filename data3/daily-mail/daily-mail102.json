At that point humans may consider lying to stay bonded sociallyThe book claims that it made us aware of feelings of pride, guilt and shame. Something that at the time would have come from a hunter-gatherer not bringing back enough meat.\u00a0'These are often referred to as self-conscious emotions, as their development requires awareness of how others are appraising us, and they differ from other social emotions, such as anger and love, in that the focus is inward,' writes von Hippel.Social awareness later encouraged lying in this later Home erectus species, something a chimp is unable to do.Psychology professor von Hippel says gossiping ensured our survival by developing complex emotions and helping the brain growWith the arrival of the Homo sapien species we know today, around 200,000 years ago, we've maintained hostility with those we deem outsiders but there's probably no need for it anymore.There's no longer as much of necessity to certain social situations to protect resources and ensure survival, known as 'the behavioral immune system'.'In a pre-medical world, the threat of disease was much greater than it is today, so we developed psychological adaptations to disease threats,' writes von Hippel.'Dislike and fear kept neighbors apart, and once you don't interact with others anymore, your languages and religions naturally diverge as well. All these processes are self-perpetuating and serve to further group separation.'Comparable to tribalism in modern days, it's prevalent from the playground to politics.But the author states it's probably not an inherited characteristic to be most proud of.'Just because we got smarter doesn't mean we got any wiser,' writes von Hippel. 'For better or worse, we haven't been able to shake many of our ancient instincts.'\u00a0\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\u00a0Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual  We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
