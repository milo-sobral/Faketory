I\u2019m educated to Master\u2019s standard in history so am not a numbskull,\u2019 said the retired banking consultant. \u2018I was told they used those terms so as not to offend non-Christians. A member of staff said they\u2019d had an awful lot of complaints about using them.\u2019The trust has also been criticised for asking volunteers to reveal their gender identity and making some helpers wear gay pride badges.Mr Pearson, 63, of Haworth, West Yorkshire, said the \u2018politically correct\u2019 terms spoiled the visit for him and his wife Elaine, 56In another row, it was derided for covering up pictures depicting men at Cragside house in Northumbria to highlight \u2018a lack of female representation in art\u2019. In the latest controversy, a Church of England spokesman said BC and AD \u2018obviously reflect Britain\u2019s Christian heritage\u2019 although both sets of terms were used.Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said using BCE and CE \u2018amounts to the dumbing down of the Christian basis of our culture, language and history\u2019.He added: \u2018Whether you use CE or AD, the date is actually still the same and the reference point is still the birth of Christ.\u2019 Only \u2018aggressive secularisers\u2019 would not like the use of BC and AD, said Dr Nazir-Ali. Mufti Barkatullah, of the Islamic Shari\u2019ah Council, said: \u2018Nobody finds BC or AD offensive as a way of denoting periods of time.\u2019A National Trust spokesman insisted: \u2018Our editorial style is to use AD and BC.\u2019 He said the charity will look into the use of BCE and CE at Avebury Manor and on some of its 19,000 website pages.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}
