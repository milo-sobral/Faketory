{"id": "Bears look for confidence in upcoming game", "paragraph": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Whether it\u2019s due to a leaking defense or quarterback Mitchell Trubisky\u2018s ill-advised throws into pass coverage, the Chicago Bears are in need of a confidence infusion.\nPlaying a 3-4 New York Jets team with its own struggles could go a long way in solving this, but the 3-3 Bears say they\u2019ve reached a point where they\u2019re only concerned with what they control in their search for answers.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t dwell on the past,\u201d linebacker Danny Trevathan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep moving forward. It\u2019s a long season. We\u2019re not in a bad situation.\u201d\nIt could be a better situation if the defense regains its swagger. Two straight losses and 69 total points allowed put the defense on its heels.\n\u201cA lot of guys are probably a little down today, probably are disappointed but not discouraged,\u201d cornerback Prince Amukamara said. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re a team that\u2019s going to continue to fight.\u201d\nPlayers had a talk from defensive coordinator Vic Fangio aimed at keeping up spirits.\n\u201cSo right now we\u2019ve just got to continue to build off that and don\u2019t let the confidence and swagger go away because that\u2019s when things really get bad for us,\u201d safety Eddie Jackson said.\nThe defense can trace its downfall to Khalil Mack\u2018s ankle injury. Although he has continued playing, he hasn\u2019t been the same force as in the first four games.\nMack couldn\u2019t practice Wednesday, and coach Matt Nagy said it\u2019s likely Mack will take the same route as last week when he rested Wednesday and Thursday, practiced on a limited basis Friday and then played.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to pick up the slack,\u201d Trevathan said.\nChicago\u2019s defense is now ranked No. 12 after being in the top five much of the season\u2019s first quarter. The Bears are eighth in sacks (19) after leading through four games.\n\u201cIt plays its part,\u201d Jackson said of Mack\u2019s injury. \u201cIt definitely plays its part, especially when a guy like Mack when he\u2019s out.\u201d\nThe Bears were hardly a poor pass rushing team before Mack came via trade from Oakland. They tied for seventh in sacks with 42 last year and played the same defense under Fangio with virtually all of the same players.\nSo they say getting pressure on Jets rookie quarterback Sam Darnold Sunday with Mack limited shouldn\u2019t be considered impossible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team, it\u2019s 11 guys on the defensive side of the ball,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo when a guy like (Mack) goes out, we\u2019ve got to put him on our back and just show him, like, it\u2019s not just you, it\u2019s going to be all of us.\u201d\nOffensively, Trubisky and the passing game could benefit if the Bears begin to run the ball more effectively. Their ranking as the sixth-best rushing team is deceiving because Trubisky has accounted for 245 yards, mostly on scrambles.\nJordan Howard averages 3.5 yards and has 90 carries, but last year after six games under former coach John Fox he was averaging 4.2 yards a carry and ran 28 more times. The effect of a struggling running attack has been apparent when the Bears had leads against the Dolphins and Patriots before losing.\n\u201cWe need to finish,\u201d guard Kyle Long said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had leads in all of (the losses) and we haven\u2019t been able to score more points to extend the lead on offense.\u201d\nNagy called a better running attack a matter of timing up the blocks in a new offense.\n\u201cAll of it, the guys are trying, and I know our numbers are skewed a little bit from the quarterback runs, but for the most part we feel like we need to create more of an identity there,\u201d Nagy said of the running attack.\nTrubisky looked at the positive side of the passing game. The Bears scored 31 even while he spent much of the time scrambling and throwing on the run, so if they can complete some from the pocket they\u2019ll be ahead of the game.\n\u201cBasically as how I described it, as playing backyard football, me running around just trying to find completions and not being very sound with my footwork and drop-backs,\u201d Trubisky said.\nWith Kansas City last year as offensive coordinator, Nagy went through a much worse stretch with six losses in seven games before the Chiefs made the playoffs.\n\u201cThere was never any panic, never,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThere is not going to be any panic here, either.\u201d\nNagy pointed out the Bears also won three straight earlier.\n\u201cGood people stick together,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThey rally through this kind of stuff and you just keep playing.\u201d\nNOTES: Wide receiver Allen Robinson (groin) did not practice. Robinson in Sunday\u2019s game aggravated the injury he suffered two weeks ago. \u2026 Guard Eric Kush (neck) did not practice. Cornerback Marcus Cooper (hamstring) had limited participation in practice. \u2026 Linebacker Roquan Smith has been listed by the Bears as suffering from a wrist injury, but he was able to practice Wednesday.\n  Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
