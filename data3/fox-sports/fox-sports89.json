{"id": "With Cook back, Vikings ready to run as weather turns cold", "paragraph": "EAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Dalvin Cook\u2019s rush through the left side of the line for 70 yards last week was the longest gain of his professional career, an early game boost for the Minnesota Vikings in an important victory over Detroit before their bye.That was the type of big running play that has been missing in most of Minnesota\u2019s games this year, a 22.05 mph burst that was clocked by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats as the fastest in the league in 2018.That also demonstrated what the Vikings will need more of down the stretch with a daunting schedule ahead.                Cook\u2019s return from a hamstring injury that kept him out of five games was one of the most important developments of the season.\u201cWhen you go to the zoo and you want to see a white tiger and they say, \u2018He\u2019s not coming out today, you\u2019re disappointed and you\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s why I bought the ticket, to see the white tiger,\u201d quarterback Kirk Cousins said after the Vikings beat the Lions 24-9 on Nov. 4. \u201cThat\u2019s Dalvin. When you get him, he\u2019s special.\u201dThough Latavius Murray has 439 total yards and five touchdowns over the past five games, Cook\u2019s return will be vital toward continuing the revival of a running game that ranks 28th in the league with an average of 91.7 yards per game.The Vikings (5-3-1) play at NFC North-leading Chicago (6-3) on Sunday night in a game for control of the division. That\u2019s one of three games over the next four for the Vikings that will be on the road and outdoors in northern cities.\u201cI do think with some of these games as it starts to get colder, it is going to be more of a factor,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting better at a lot of the areas in the running game. We have to continue searching for more ways to pound the ball.\u201dWhen Cook was healthy in the season opener against San Francisco, the Vikings had 116 rushing yards. They then went four straight games with fewer than 20 rushing attempts and 77 rushing yards or fewer, until Murray produced a 155-yard performance on 24 carries in a victory over Arizona on Oct. 14 .Cook and Murray combined for 120 rushing yards against the Lions. The Vikings have averaged 124 rushing yards over the past four games, up from 65.8 yards per game on the ground over the first five weeks.\u201cHe has got a chance to hit home runs,\u201d Zimmer said of Cook. \u201cI think it was really good for him to get out there and get some game time action. When you haven\u2019t played in six weeks and you haven\u2019t practiced all that much, I think he will continue to get better.\u201dThe Vikings also claimed running back Ameer Abdullah last week after he was waived by the Lions. Abdullah, a second-round draft pick in 2015, only appeared in three games this year and carried the ball once. He averaged 3.8 yards per attempt in three seasons as the primary ball carrier, when he wasn\u2019t injured, before being replaced by rookie Kerryon Johnson this season.\u201cI\u2019m entering a backfield with a lot of talent, Dalvin, we have Latavius and all the guys who\u2019ve been here,\u201d Abdullah said after practice on Monday. \u201cJust coming in today and seeing these guys welcome me the way they have has been amazing for me. It does a lot for my confidence. It does a lot for my focus.\u201dAbdullah will also be an option as a kickoff returner.\u201cI\u2019m ready to work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything the Vikings ask me to do, I\u2019m willing to do just because I\u2019m so appreciative of the opportunity.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
