{"id": "No. 10 LSU, Orgeron, eye Tigers\u2019 best season 2012", "paragraph": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Although LSU cannot win the Southeastern Conference championship, victories in its next two games will result in a regular season that exceeded expectations by a wide margin.The 10th-ranked Tigers need to beat Rice this Saturday and Texas A&M in College Station the following week for their first 10-win regular season since 2012. That probably also would put LSU in a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl.So while coach Ed Orgeron hoped the Tigers could contend for a championship, he doesn\u2019t want to downplay the improvement he\u2019s seen in the program, which was ranked 25th in the preseason poll and climbed as high as fourth before sliding back on the heels of a loss to No. 1 Alabama.\u201cThis team wanted to win a national championship,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cBut, we never set that as a goal for this team. This is LSU. I know the expectations. We are getting the most out of this football team. We still have two tough games to go. Going to a New Year\u2019s Day bowl would be a good step.\u201dThe Tigers did enough to defeat Arkansas 24-17 last Saturday. LSU squandered much of a 21-point advantage in the fourth quarter before running out the clock to preserve its eighth victory of the year.\u201cWe have to finish the game,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cI was disappointed that we did not finish the game strong.\u201dFor the first time since the Ole Miss game in late September, quarterback Joe Burrow threw a touchdown pass \u2014 a 40-yarder to Justin Jefferson. However, for the fifth consecutive game, Burrow failed to throw for more than 200 yards.Moreover, the Tigers have had just one back rush for more than 100 yards in that five-game span. Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran for 145 yards in LSU\u2019s 36-16 victory against Georgia.\u201cWe have lost our identity on offense,\u201d Oregeron said. \u201cWe have been trying some new things. Maybe we have put too much in. We may need to simplify.\u201dOrgeron said he told offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger, \u201cLet\u2019s look at what we did vs. Georgia. Are we covering up for some of our weaknesses? Is it that we can\u2019t have enough receivers out in routes because of (pass) protection?\u201dThis season was expected to be a rebuilding year, largely because LSU\u2019s offense entered the season with only three returning starters: tight end Foster Moreau, left tackle Saahdiq Charles and left guard Garrett Brumfield. LSU lost a fourth returning starter when right guard Ed Ingram was suspended indefinitely before the start of practice.Charles and Brumfield have missed a combined eight games. Those two players have been together on the starting offensive line just four times.\u201cThe offensive line has played good, but we have not been consistent,\u201d starting center Lloyd Cushenberry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little mixture of everything. Sometimes things happen in football. Coming into the season, people thought we were going get demolished in every game. We have done well.\u201cGetting to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game would be huge for this team,\u201d Cushenberry added. \u201cPeople outside the team didn\u2019t think we were going to be good this year. They thought we would win just six games. We have a chance to prove ourselves right and that they were wrong.\u201dLSU is a 40-plus point favorite over a one-win Rice team. The Tigers will have a greater challenge when they close the regular season at Texas A&M.\u201cOur target this week is Rice and nothing else,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cOur focus is to be 9-2 at the end of the week. Getting to a New Year\u2019s bowl is really important for the players. We have talked about finishing strong. We have to play well this week and play well next week.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
