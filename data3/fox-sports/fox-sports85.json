So that\u2019s something I need to work on, and that\u2019s going to be one of my goals, to stay healthy for a long full season and be able to the team win from day one.\u201dAtlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. was a runaway choice for the NL honor over Washington outfielder Juan Soto in a contest between 20-year-olds.A singular sensation who earned a chorus of praise for his dual success, Ohtani became the first player since Ruth in 1919 with 10 homers and four pitching wins in the same season.He didn\u2019t play between June 4 and July 3 because of a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, an injury the Angels were aware of when they signed him for a $2,315,000 bonus last winter. The 24-year-old right-hander made just one more mound appearance, on Sept. 2, and three days later the team said a scan revealed additional damage and surgery was recommended.Ohtani appeared in 22 more games as a hitter, had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1 and hopes to be able to help the Angels at the plate next season. He probably won\u2019t take the mound again until 2020.\u201cEverything\u2019s going well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re right on schedule, maybe even a little ahead.\u201dOhtani, who left the Nippon Ham Fighters to play in the major leagues, received 25 first-place votes and four seconds for 137 points from the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America. New York Yankees third baseman Miguel Andujar was second with five firsts and 89 points, and Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres was next with 25 points.Ohtani was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA and 63 strikeouts over 51 2/3 innings in 10 starts. As a designated hitter, he batted .285 with 22 homers and 61 RBIs and a .925 OPS in 367 plate appearances.\u201cOf course, getting hurt is never a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to fight through it.\u201dHe is the first Japanese player to win a rookie honor since Seattle\u2019s Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 and the fourth overall, joining the Dodgers\u2019 Hideo Nomo in 1995 and Seattle\u2019s Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000. Ohtani became the first player with 15 homers as a batter and 50 strikeouts as a pitcher in the same season.Acuna received 27 first-place votes and three seconds for 144 points. Soto got two firsts and 89 points, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler was next with one first and 28 points.Acuna, in Japan with a major league All-Star team, declined to participate in a morning conference call about the vote, BBWAA secretary-treasurer Jack O\u2019Connell said.Acuna started the season at Triple-A and made his debut on April 25, the youngest player in the majors then at 20 years, 128 days. The Venezuelan hit .293 with 26 homers, 64 RBIs and 16 steals with a .917 OPS. He set a Braves record with eight leadoff homers this season and tied a franchise mark by homering in five straight games from Aug. 11-14.Soto debuted on May 20 at 19 years, 207 days, although in a quirk the Dominican is credited with a home run from five days before his debut \u2014 he went deep on June 18 against the New York Yankees in the completion of the May 15 suspended game. Soto hit .292 with 22 homers, 70 RBIs and a .923 OPS. He was two shy of Tony Conigliaro\u2019s big league record for home runs by a teenager.The AL and NL Manager of the Year will be announced Tuesday. Boston\u2019s Alex Cora, Tampa Bay\u2019s Kevin Cash and Oakland\u2019s Bob Melvin are the finalists for the AL honor and Atlanta\u2019s Brian Snitker, Milwaukee\u2019s Craig Counsell and Colorado\u2019s Bud Black are the finalists for the NL award.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
