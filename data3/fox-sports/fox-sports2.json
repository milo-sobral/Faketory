The teams combined for 68 points in the first half, and continued to keep the scoreboard operator busy in the second.When it was all said and done, Missouri rolled over Memphis. Drew Lock threw for 350 yards and four touchdowns on 23-for-29 passing, and Missouri defeated Memphis 65-33 in its homecoming game on Saturday.After losing three straight Southeastern Conference contests, Missouri (4-3) responded with a much-needed victory. It jumped out to a 21-0 lead less than six minutes into the game, and never relinquished it.\u201cI thought the offensive staff leading up to today, they did a heck of a job of putting together a game plan, finding a way to get us some matchups,\u201d Missouri coach Barry Odom said. \u201cSome one-on-one matchups. And formationally, we were able to do some things that really gave us an advantage.\u201dAlbert Okwuegbunam took advantage of one-on-one coverage multiple times throughout the contest. He caught six passes for 159 yards and three touchdowns and Jalen Knox had five catches for 104 yards and a score.All of Memphis\u2019 scoring came without star running back Darrell Henderson, who exited the game after four carries in the first quarter. He was seen riding on a stationary bike and left to the locker room in the second quarter.Henderson entered the game leading the nation with 1,133 rushing yards, 15 total touchdowns and 10.3 yards per carry. Tony Pollard and Patrick Taylor Jr. split carries the rest of the way, and Memphis\u2019 rushing attack was limited to 4.6 yards per carry.Missouri sprinted out of the gates by blocking a punt on Memphis\u2019 first drive and Christian Holmes intercepted Brady White\u2019s pass for a 42-yard touchdown return on Memphis\u2019 second drive.Memphis (4-4) climbed back with 17 straight points, but Missouri responded with 20 consecutive of its own. Missouri\u2019s defense slowed down the visiting Tigers in the second half, and the home Tigers cruised to their first victory since Sept. 15 against Purdue.THE TAKEAWAYMemphis: Contrary to its close game against No. 10 Central Florida last week, Memphis looked thoroughly outplayed against Missouri. Memphis fans will be closely watching the status of Henderson\u2019s injury.\u201cNot the showing we wanted to have,\u201d Memphis coach Mike Norvell said. \u201cGot off to a slow start, turned the ball over, had miscues in every phase and gave up too many explosive plays defensively and had some missed assignments that really cost us.\u201dMissouri: The Tigers broke out of their three-game losing streak in a big way. Lock and the Missouri offense found its form, and the Tigers look to carry momentum into the second half of SEC play.TURNING POINTAfter 17 unanswered Memphis points, Missouri faced a fourth-and-1 on its own 34. Lock completed a pass to Jonathon Johnson. The next play was a 58-yard touchdown pass to Albert Okwuegbunam. Missouri scored 20 consecutive points to open up its lead.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty gutsy call,\u201d Lock said. \u201cThe tides turned. We picked that up, we scored. Came back, scored again. The momentum swang in our way. It was a big point in the game.\u201dHENDERSON HURTAgainst Missouri, Henderson spent more time riding the bike than running the ball. Memphis coach Mike Norvell described the injury as a \u201ctweak\u201d and declined to be more specific. Pollard was prepared to come in relief.\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018next man\u2019 mentality,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we go about things. You\u2019ve just got to be ready when your number\u2019s called.\u201dUNLOCKEDLock threw for just one touchdown and five interceptions in his previous three games. The last time he tossed for over 300 yards and four touchdowns came against Wyoming in week two, when he compiled 398 yards and four touchdowns.\u201cI thought he was smart with the ball,\u201d Odom said. \u201cHe\u2019s continuing to grow, he\u2019s such a talented kid and player. In-game adjustments, I thought, was maybe one of the best ways that he\u2019s done up to this point.\u201dUP NEXTMemphis has a bye week before facing East Carolina on Nov. 3.Missouri returns to conference play with a home matchup next Saturday against No. 14 Kentucky.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
