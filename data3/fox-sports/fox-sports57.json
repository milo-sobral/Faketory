Realmuto says his client has informed the Miami Marlins he won\u2019t sign a long-term contract, increasing the likelihood the team will trade yet another All-Star.The Marlins have said they\u2019d like a lengthy deal with Realmuto, but they\u2019re coming off their ninth consecutive losing season and in a rebuilding phase that will probably continue for several years. Realmuto doesn\u2019t become eligible for free agency until after the 2020 season and would command a considerable return in a trade.\u201cI think he will definitely be wearing a different uniform by the start of spring training,\u201d said his agent, Jeff Berry, on MLB Network Radio on Tuesday.A new deal with Realmuto would send a signal the team\u2019s roster might no longer be a revolving door as players depart when they become too expensive. But the catcher asked to be traded a year ago when the Marlins dismantled under new CEO Derek Jeter, and a 98-loss season apparently didn\u2019t change Realmuto\u2019s desire to play elsewhere.\u201cJ.T. has informed the Marlins\u2019 ownership, he has informed their front office, he\u2019s not going to sign an extension in Miami,\u201d Berry said. \u201cYou could keep him for two years or not. It makes sense, when you have one of the more valuable trade assets in baseball, to move him. Period.\u201dThe Marlins declined comment.Realmuto, 27, made the All-Star team for the first time this year and had 21 homers and 74 RBIs, both career highs, while batting .277. He had a $2.9 million salary this year after losing in arbitration, and he is eligible for arbitration this winter and again following the 2019 season.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
