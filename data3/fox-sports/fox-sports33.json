{"id": "Raiders QB Derek Carr tries to ignore criticism", "paragraph": "ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Derek Carr\u2019s No. 1 receiver has been traded just weeks after the Oakland Raiders dealt away another cornerstone player in Khalil Mack. Carr has just one win, has struggled to adjust to coach Jon Gruden\u2019s offense and has taken more of a physical beating than he has at any time during his five-year career.As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he also has had to deal with reports that unidentified teammates have lost faith in him and his toughness has been questioned.\u201cI don\u2019t pay that any mind,\u201d Carr said Wednesday. \u201cJust go talk to those guys. If they don\u2019t want to put their name on it, I am going to leave it as what it is. It\u2019s nothing to me. If they want to come say it to my locker, I\u2019ve had plenty of tough discussions standing right here with teammates. Those are some of the guys that texted me yesterday, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about this bull.\u2019 That kind of stuff. I can\u2019t tell you how many texts I got from former teammates, teammates I have now and all of these things that when you\u2019re losing, (bad stuff) happens.\u201dTight end Lee Smith gave a long statement defending Carr in what was otherwise a mostly empty locker room during the open media period. He called a recent report that the locker room is fractured over Carr \u201ccomical and laughable\u201d and said Carr remains the leader of this team.Smith said it\u2019s a \u201cjoke\u201d that Carr has to deal with this criticism, including that it looked like he was crying after injuring his left arm in a loss to Seattle in London on Oct. 14.\u201cHe\u2019s a human being,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re human beings. We\u2019re not robots. He has a 1-5 record as a starting quarterback for the Oakland Raiders. That\u2019s hard enough on him. Much less him worrying about his two sons happening to see an article that he\u2019s not tough. It\u2019s ridiculous. Of course it would bother him. He\u2019s human.\u201dCarr\u2019s play has also not lived up to expectations as he has been hurt by a banged-up offensive line that got him sacked six times in the loss to the Seahawks.Carr has thrown more interceptions (eight) than touchdown passes (seven) so far this season and was unable to get the ball downfield at all in the game against the Seahawks when he threw just one pass more than 10 yards downfield and gained 140 of his 142 yards after the catch.\u201cI think Carr is going to be fine,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe have a lot of moving pieces now on offense. It\u2019s tough on a quarterback. In the first year of a system it\u2019s doubly tough. I\u2019m going to keep supporting him. I know I believe in him. I know he\u2019s going to be a great player. You watch and see, he\u2019ll play just fine on Sunday.\u201dA season that began with optimism with the return of Gruden as coach has gone off the rails quickly. The team traded Mack to Chicago just over a week before the start of the season for a package of draft picks and then dealt Cooper to Dallas on Monday for another first-round pick.The trades give the Raiders three first-round picks in 2019 and two more the following year but none of that will help win games now for the players still here.The Raiders (1-5) have been outscored 53-13 in losing their past two games and have been accused of tanking the season because they traded Cooper and Mack.\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve had to do this a couple of times in my early five years,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThat part is hard. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t change my mindset, you guys know that. Good things, bad things, it doesn\u2019t change who I am and how I work. I still have a job to do. It\u2019s going to be harder without Coop, it\u2019s going to be harder without Khalil, we knew that. It\u2019s not going to make it easier, especially for us, for a quarterback and things like that. But that\u2019s no excuse. We need to go perform and we need to go win games and that\u2019s my mindset.\u201dNOTES: LG Kelechi Osemele has not returned to practice from a knee injury that has sidelined him the past two weeks and his status for this week remains in doubt. \u2026 S Karl Joseph (hamstring), OL Jon Feliciano (ribs) and DL Frostee Rucker (neck) were all back on the practice field.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
