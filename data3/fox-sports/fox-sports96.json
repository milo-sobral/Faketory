{"id": "Saints, Brees piling up points at franchise-record rate", "paragraph": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The dynamic Saints running back duo of Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara agree that the word \u201csavage\u201d best describes New Orleans\u2019 offense.Certainly, the Saints are scoring so often, and in so many ways, it\u2019s enough to bruise defenders\u2019 egos.\u201cI\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to play them,\u201d Saints linebacker Alex Anzalone said Monday, a day after New Orleans broke the 50-point mark in a victory over Cincinnati.Even by the lofty standards offensive-minded coach Sean Payton and record-setting quarterback Drew Brees have set since joining forces in 2006, New Orleans is putting points on the board with exceptional proficiency.The Saints have never averaged better than 34.2 points per game for an entire season. That mark was set by New Orleans\u2019 2011 squad that featured Brees and four skill players that each gained more than 950 yards from scrimmage: tight end Jimmy Graham, receiver Marques Colston, and running backs Darren Sproles and Pierre Thomas.The 2018 Saints, who host defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia on Sunday, currently lead the NFL with an average 36.7 points through nine games. Maintaining that pace for the rest of the regular season would put them third all-time in scoring behind the 2013 Denver Broncos (37.9 points per game) and the 2007 New England Patriots (36.8). And the way the Saints are playing, their current scoring average could very well increase before the season is out. They\u2019ve scored at least 40 points in five of nine games so far.They\u2019ve also added yet another potential receiving target, signing veteran Brandon Marshall on Monday.\u201cHe\u2019s got good length and size. He\u2019s another big target,\u201d Payton said of the 34-year-old Marshall, who became a free agent when he was released by Seattle on Oct. 30. \u201cI thought size was important but (also) experience and someone that we felt had strong hands.\u201dEleven different Saints have gotten in the end zone this season, including Brees, who dove over the pile at the line of scrimmage for his third rushing TD this season during Sunday\u2019s 51-14 triumph at Cincinnati. The 39-year-old QB also is having one of his most efficient seasons, completing 77.3 percent of his passes for 21 TDs and only one interception.Brees\u2019 completion rate arguably has been aided by his decision to often throw shorter passes, particularly to Kamara, who has 55 receptions for 473 yards and three TDs. But Brees asserts that Saints\u2019 offensive production has stemmed in no small part from their ability to methodically sustain drives with high-percentage plays.\u201cIt pays dividends as the game goes on,\u201d Brees said. \u201cYou wear a defense down. \u2026 We say, \u2018Don\u2019t get bored with the (short) completions, the four-yard runs. They result in big plays if we keep it up.\u201dA case in point is Brees\u2019 72-yard game-breaking touchdown pass to receiver Michael Thomas in the final minutes of a Week 9 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, whose defenders crashed down to swarm Kamara on the play.During the Payton-Brees era, the Saints have more often than not been a pass-heavy team. But not this season. New Orleans ranks eighth in yards rushing and seventh in yards passing.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to have balance,\u201d Payton said. \u201cOur offensive line has played well. We\u2019ve been consistent rushing the football. I feel like Drew\u2019s playing at high level. \u2026 Having that ability to rush or pass is something that can help.\u201dAnd while Brees is in the twilight of his career, New Orleans is enjoying major production from two of its younger skill players.The 23-year-old Kamara has 1,109 yards and 14 TDs from scrimmage on mix of runs and receptions. Thomas, 25, has caught 78 passes for 950 yards and seven TDs.Saints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk is in only his second NFL season, but said even he can see the Saints\u2019 offense is \u201cdefinitely special.\u201d\u201cThe cohesiveness up front really helps us out. And then guys like Mark and Alvin and Drew, Michael \u2014 all those guys around us \u2014 are special athletes,\u201d Ramzcyk said. \u201cWhen we come together, we can make a lot of great things happen.\u201dAnd that takes a lot of pressure off the Saints\u2019 defense, which yielded 48 points in a season-opening loss, but since has been good enough to help New Orleans win eight straight. Next up are the Philadelphia Eagles (4-5).\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be super heroes,\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to always go our way, but we just have to give our offense a chance, and we\u2019ve been able to do that these past eight games.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
