{"id": "Nuggets mired in 3-game slump with Rockets arriving in town", "paragraph": "DENVER (AP) \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone kept the mood light at practice Monday and the lectures to a minimum.No reason to get too worked up over Denver\u2019s current three-game skid. After all, this is the same bunch that began 9-1 for one of the best starts in franchise history.Malone\u2019s missive to his team: Rediscover that resolve.\u201cIt\u2019s too early in the season to have their heads down and have it be gloom and doom,\u201d said Malone, whose team hosts James Harden, Chris Paul and the Houston Rockets on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re young. Some of these guys are in moments they haven\u2019t been in before. That\u2019s my job, to teach and keep this team moving along in the right direction.\u201dGiven their recent history, there\u2019s a sense of early season urgency. That\u2019s understandable since the Nuggets missed the playoffs by a game in each of the last two years. They don\u2019t want piled-up losses in November to come back and haunt them in April.Especially since everything was going so smoothly out of the gate. But the Nuggets (9-4) have followed a two-point loss in Memphis with two straight defeats at home \u2014112-110 to Brooklyn on Friday and 121-114 to Milwaukee on Sunday, where 7-footer Brook Lopez hit eight 3-pointers.\u201cThe first thing is to acknowledge it for what it is \u2014 a couple really close losses,\u201d said Nuggets center Mason Plumlee, whose team had only one skid that reached as high as three games a season ago. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t call it a tailspin. We have another opportunity (against Houston) to get back on track.\u201dThis is a Nuggets team that a week ago was being billed as one of the surprises in the West. They knocked off Boston in a game where Jamal Murray erupted for 48 points. Murray took some heat, though, for shooting at the buzzer in his bid to reach 50.In the three losses since the Celtics contest, he\u2019s scored a combined 45 points.It\u2019s also been an up-and-down stretch for standout center Nikola Jokic, who\u2019s gone from taking one jumper against Memphis \u2014 a long 3-pointer at the end \u2014 to bouncing back with 37 points against Brooklyn to scoring 20 against Milwaukee. He also had a late turnover against the Bucks \u2014 one of three Nuggets miscues over the final 3:04 with the team leading by a basket.\u201cThere\u2019s not like a big disconnect,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cWe have to execute better on both ends in late-game situations. It\u2019s unexpected because we executed so well early and often in that winning streak. We did last year, too. It will be better.\u201dOn Monday, the Nuggets spent the early portion of practice reviewing game film. Like always, Malone showed footage and asked for volunteers to give their input. And like always, one of the hands that shot up belonged to injured point guard Isaiah Thomas.His words carry a lot of weight even if he can\u2019t take the floor as he recovers from hip surgery.\u201cThe guys understand his body of work, the player he has been, and the player he will be again,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHis leadership, his voice, his encouraging guys, his getting on guys, I think it\u2019s invaluable.\u201dJust Thomas\u2019 way of being a leader. There remains no timetable for his return.\u201cYou need a guy like that in the locker room,\u201d guard Monte Morris said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s good, he\u2019ll tell you. When it\u2019s bad, he just tells us. We definitely appreciate him.\u201dOne early surprise has been the play of the bench, with Morris, Trey Lyles, Plumlee and Malik Beasley giving the Nuggets a lift. Case in point: Morris had a career-high 10 assists against the Bucks.\u201cOur fun is creating turnovers and getting out into the transition, giving the fans at Pepsi Center what they came to see \u2014 fast basketball,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf we can defend like we\u2019ve been doing and get out in transition, it will be fun. We\u2019ve been having fun all year.\u201dThis losing stretch, Plumlee reasoned, is just a tiny hiccup.\u201cBut we\u2019re a good enough team where that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be sharper. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how we respond.\u201dNOTES: Will Barton (surgery to fix core/hip muscle injuries) and rookie Michael Porter Jr . (back surgery) were at practice Monday shooting jumpers.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
