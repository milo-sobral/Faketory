{"id": "Bowman back with 408 yards, 3 TDs in Texas Tech win over KU", "paragraph": "LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) \u2014 Alan Bowman threw for 408 yards and three touchdowns while playing for the first time since suffering a partially collapsed lung three weeks ago, and Texas Tech beat Kansas 48-16 on Saturday.\u201cLooked like he never even had an injury,\u201d receiver Antoine Wesley said.Bowman completed 36 of 47 passes while showing accuracy on short and deep passes, with only one interception. The true freshman was the nation\u2019s leading passer when he got crushed between two West Virginia defenders in Texas Tech\u2019s last home game Sept. 29, and was released from the hospital four days later.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. We just wanted to make sure practice went well. Didn\u2019t want any setbacks,\u201d coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \u201cWe felt confident \u2026 a few days after he got out of the hospital that he\u2019d be ready for this date. We just wanted to make sure he held up, felt good. His breathing was fine.\u201dAfter coming out early in that loss to West Virginia, Bowman missed only one game. Jett Duffey started a 17-14 win at TCU. On his only drive in the fourth quarter Saturday, Duffey completed all three of his passes for 33 yards before DeMarcus Felton\u2019s 34-yard TD run for a 48-9 lead.Wesley, who entered the game third nationally with 117 yards receiving a game, had nine catches for 155 yards and a nifty one-handed grab for a 6-yard touchdown. T.J. Vasher and Seth Collins also had TD catches for the Red Raiders (5-2, 3-1 Big 12), who had 553 total yards despite three turnovers.Kansas (2-5, 0-4) lost its 43rd consecutive true Big 12 road game, dating back to a 35-33 win at Iowa State on Oct. 4, 2008.But the Jayhawks weren\u2019t surprised to see Bowman in the game, no matter how coy Kingsbury had been about who would be his starting quarterback.\u201cOur defensive game plan was all around Bowman,\u201d senior linebacker Joe Dineen Jr. said. \u201cOur coaches knew that he was going to be able to go this week, so we really prepared for him.\u201dThe Jayhawks played their first game since offensive coordinator Doug Meacham was fired. Peyton Bender threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns while freshman Pooka Williams had 16 carries for 70 yards to finish 38 yards below his rushing average that was second-best in the Big 12.\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed because we didn\u2019t do enough to help us win,\u201d coach David Beaty said of the overall offensive output. \u201cWe had a firm understanding of what we were doing. I think everybody felt comfortable there. They were engaged the entire time.\u201dTHE TAKEAWAYKansas: The Jayhawks have lost all four of their Big 12 games after finishing their nonconference schedule with consecutive victories games for the first time since 2009.Texas Tech: Coach Kliff Kingsbury is back to .500 as coach of his alma mater \u2014 at 35-35 overall in his sixth season. The former Red Raiders quarterback was 7-0 in his coaching debut in 2013, and is 28-35 since. Tech is one win shy of bowl eligibility, a mark it didn\u2019t reach until the regular-season finale last year.RED RAIDER DThe Red Raiders has held consecutive conference opponents under 20 points for the first time since 2013, and had three sacks against the Jayhawks. Senior linebacker Kolin Hill had his first two sacks of the season.\u201cEspecially when I first got here, we weren\u2019t known for defense at all,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely something that we stress. Things have changed for us defensively.\u201dEXTRA POINTSEight different players caught passes from Bowman. \u2026 Dineen had two tackles for loss, giving him 41 for his career and matching Willie Pless for the school record.UP NEXTKansas:  Home to play TCU next Saturday.Texas Tech: Plays Saturday at Iowa State.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
