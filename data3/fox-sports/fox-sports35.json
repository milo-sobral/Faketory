{"id": "ACC coaches have more questions than worries about G League", "paragraph": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Atlantic Coast Conference coaches say they have more questions than worries about the NBA G League option for elite prospects.The G League will offer \u201cselect contracts\u201d worth $125,000 next year to elite prospects who are not yet eligible for the NBA, a move that could slightly lessen the handful of one-and-done players at the college level.Questions the ACC coaches had at ACC\u2019s preseason media day on Wednesday were about how the process will work, how many players it might affect and whether it will really make much of a change to college basketball after a year of changes in the wake of a federal investigation into corruption within the sport.North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams is taking a wait-and-see approach. Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski said there will always be one-and-done college players regardless of NBA restrictions or G League contracts. Leonard Hamilton of Florida State said skipping college altogether to place an emphasis on turning pro is \u201calmost like fool\u2019s gold.\u201dNot surprisingly, the coaches in general believe playing at the top level of college basketball is still the best option for the elite recruits.\u201cIf they think they\u2019re going to get the top player in the country to go play there, why would you do that?\u201d Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. \u201cYou can go to college and you\u2019re going to be better than everybody else there. You\u2019re not better than everybody else in the G League, I can tell you that. I don\u2019t care who you are.\u201dThe G League plan lacked details such as how players will be identified as potential targets. There would be no cap on the number of players who could sign a deal, though it would likely be limited to at most only a handful of players each year.\u201cI think there will be some that it appeals to, but I also think that a lot of the prospects \u2026 grow up thinking about playing college basketball, playing in the NCAA Tournament, things like that,\u201d North Carolina senior guard Kenny Williams said. \u201cSo I think the money\u2019s enticing, but I think that a lot of the kids will still grow up with that dream and want to fulfill that dream.\u201dThe G League\u2019s plan comes after the Commission on College Basketball, chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, issued numerous recommended reforms for the sport in the spring after the corruption case that led to charges against 10 men for providing money and benefits to steer recruits to schools, agents or an apparel company. Three people were convicted in the case on Wednesday.The commission\u2019s proposals included for the NBA to do away with its 19-year-old age limit that has fueled the rise of one-and-done players who play in college for a season. The restriction is expected to change through an amendment to the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and its players in time for the 2022 draft.The G League contract provides a more immediate option and though it is for $125,000, a player could get additional income from endorsement deals.Syracuse recruit Darius Bazley, who passed on playing for the Orange this season to work toward next year\u2019s NBA draft, had landed a job as an intern for apparel company New Balance, the New York Times reported this week. Agent Rich Paul said the deal is part of a multiyear shoe contract that could pay Bazley at least $1 million and up to $14 million in performance incentives.Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner questions whether most players who might take the G League route would be able to land similar deals.\u201cFor the guy who\u2019s maybe ranked in the top 10 or 5 in the recruiting classes, they can maybe do it,\u201d Pastner said. \u201cMaybe they do get a shoe deal or something like that. But if you don\u2019t have a lot of hype, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to take you or even get you under contract.\u201dBut Joe Favorito, a sports and entertainment marketing consultant, believes the opportunities could be there. He pointed to the Ball family building its own Big Baller Brand apparel company despite the fact that LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball never had the recognition that comes with playing major college basketball.\u201cThis is for a very limited number of people because you have to be able to sing and dance,\u201d said Favorito, a faculty member at Columbia. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to have to be able to play at a very elite level, forgo college and have the maturity for the one year. And also have enough savvy or at least the right person around you to help engage and manage all the opportunities that come along that are nontraditional. . So yeah, I think there are opportunities.\u201dThe G League plan offers at least another avenue for NBA prospects if they don\u2019t want to play in college or have trouble qualifying academically. It also frees them to receive a salary and endorsement deals unavailable in college due to NCAA rules.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it helps,\u201d ACC Commissioner John Swofford said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt in my mind.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
