{"id": "Vikings welcome Everson Griffen back to practice", "paragraph": "EAGAN, Minn. \u2014 Everson Griffen was back at practice with the Minnesota Vikings for the first time in almost six weeks, a significant point of progress in returning to his spot at right defensive end and re-establishing his pass-rushing and run-stopping skills in a game setting for the NFC North leaders.\nThe first and most important step, though, was acknowledging his need for mental health treatment in the tough-guy environment of football that has long fostered a mindset of powering through a problem.\n\t\u201cSometimes you\u2019ve just got to put your pride aside and know when enough is enough. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to take it upon yourself and know when enough is enough and when you can\u2019t handle it,\u201d Griffen said.\nGriffen was a full participant in the workout on Wednesday afternoon, but coach Mike Zimmer said the decision about whether he\u2019d play for the Vikings (4-2-1) on Sunday night against New Orleans would be made at the end of the week. Stephen Weatherly has started in Griffen\u2019s place at right end for the past five games.\n\u201cI feel good. I was able to work out and do the things I have to do, but playing this game of football, it requires more than just working out,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push somebody, hit somebody, get your timing back.\u201d\nThough Griffen\u2019s reintegration with the defense will be gradual, his welcome by the team was not.\n\u201cIt felt great to see my guys, man. I love each and every one of my teammates, and it was just good to see the smiles on their face,\u201d said Griffen, who was\u00a0taken by ambulance to a hospital on Sept. 22 after a scary series of incidents\u00a0around the Twin Cities when he threatened violence in a hotel lobby and made repeated comments about people trying to kill him.\n\u201cI had a lot of support from my family, the Minnesota Vikings, the doctors, my teammates, the fans, and you know I want to give my apologizes to people I impacted. I\u2019m sorry if I affected them in any type of way,\u201d Griffen said.\n\t7\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNoah K. Murray | USA TODAY Sports\t\t\t\t\t\u201cI\u2019m just excited to get back here with my team and get back to the grind of things. It\u2019s been hard to be away, but I\u2019m happy to be back. It\u2019s a good feeling right now, and I\u2019m taking one day at a time and one thing at a time to get things back on track.\u201d\nVikings general manager Rick Spielman said the organization was in communication with Griffen\u2019s medical team throughout his hiatus, relying on the professional recommendations regarding his return.\n\u201cThis is an illness,\u201d Zimmer said, \u201cand he\u2019s done a good job of helping to get better and continues to try to get better. He is probably going to have to continue to do that, just like we all have to do in life.\u201d\nGriffen politely declined to discuss in detail his treatment plan or specific issues, but said he\u2019d do so in the future to use his public platform as way to positively influence the millions of Americans who struggle with some form of mental illness.\n\u201cYou need to ask for help. You need to go out there and find a good support team and do the right things to be able to take care of yourself,\u201d Griffen said.\nSeeking and maintaining a work-life balance was a daily goal that Griffen frequently mentioned during a 10-minute session with reporters, his first such appearance since playing at Green Bay on Sept. 16 in the second game of the season.\n\u201cI learned a lot about the man outside of football. I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and where I want to go and the decisions I made,\u201d he said.\nMake no mistake, though: Being back in the meeting rooms and on the practice field with the Vikings was a cathartic experience.\n\u201cIt was awesome, man. Just getting back to life in general, driving my car, doing all the little things,\u201d Griffen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to appreciate the little things in life.\u201d\n Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
