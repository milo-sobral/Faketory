{"id": "Patriots have short turnaround with Rodgers, Packers next", "paragraph": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 The Patriots are accustomed to making adjustments.That was certainly their philosophy during their matchup with the Bills on Monday night.Down to just two healthy running backs on the roster with leading rusher and rookie Sony Michel inactive with a knee injury, New England started receiver Cordarrelle Patterson in the backfield in a move done more out of necessity than by design.While unusual, it didn\u2019t provide a lot of traction during a 25-6 victory in which Tom Brady was held without a passing touchdown and the offense was paced by Stephen Gostkowski\u2019s four field goals.But it might have been a glimpse at how creative the Patriots (6-2) are willing to be to keep alive a win streak that has grown to five games with a visit from Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night.This will be just the second meeting between Brady and Aaron Rodgers, with Rodgers winning the first matchup 26-21 in Green Bay in 2014.The two future Hall of Famers enter the rematch as the only active players with multiple Most Valuable Player awards (Brady three, Rodgers two).Green Bay is coming off a 29-27 loss to the unbeaten Rams and is just 3-3-1 on the season. But Brady said he is expecting to get the best from a player he considers to be \u201cone of the best to ever play.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a big game for us,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re in it every year. \u2026 So it\u2019ll be exciting and we\u2019re going to have to play really well. It\u2019s a quick turnaround.\u201dIf Michel can return this week it would decrease the stress on Brady and the passing game. Michel has the Patriots\u2019 only 100-yard rushing games in 2018.But even if he\u2019s not ready to go, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is confident they\u2019ll be able to adapt again if necessary.One of the reasons is the consistent production of James White. While primarily a receiving threat, he can break runs out of the backfield. He had New England\u2019s lone rushing touchdown against the Bills.\u201cJames is a very dependable guy. Whatever it is we ask of him, we count on him to do a lot of things, and he usually does those things very well,\u201d McDaniels said.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a lot of guys in your offense that can be counted on. \u2026 He\u2019s always been a big contributor to what we\u2019re doing, and he\u2019s got a lot of teammates that try to do the same thing.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
