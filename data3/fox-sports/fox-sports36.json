{"id": "Puerto Rico proud: Cardinals star Molina wins Clemente Award", "paragraph": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Many around Major League Baseball rallied to help Puerto Rico after it was ravaged by Hurricane Maria last year.The efforts of one native son were honored with an award named for the island\u2019s greatest player Wednesday.St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina was named the recipient of the Roberto Clemente Award, a fitting recognition for the star who grew up on Puerto Rico and idolized the island\u2019s late Hall of Famer.Commissioner Rob Manfred and Clemente\u2019s widow, Vera Clemente, presented the award to members of Molina\u2019s family before Game 2 of the World Series. It is given annually to the player who best represents Clemente\u2019s humanitarian efforts.Molina wasn\u2019t on hand to receive the award himself because he is currently in Colombia, coaching Puerto Rico\u2019s under-23 national baseball team in the Baseball World Cup. Clemente also managed the national team while he was playing in the major leagues.Molina has worked tirelessly to help Puerto Rico recover from the effects of Maria last year.The 36-year-old Molina and his wife, Wanda, in 2010 created the Foundation4 (Fundacion4) to improve the lives of underprivileged children on the island who have been affected by poverty, abuse and cancer.\u201cWhat he represents for the whole country and for all of Latin America is the same spirit that dad had,\u201d Clemente\u2019s son, Luis, said of Molina. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud to continue the Clemente legacy.\u201dRed Sox manager Alex Cora, who is from Caguas, Puerto Rico, greeted Molina\u2019s family during the award presentation and gave Vera Clemente flowers.Cora, who has also been a visual presence in the hurricane relief efforts back on his native island, said he is an admirer of the work Molina has done there in the aftermath of the storm.\u201cI call him the leader because he\u2019s the leader of our national team. He\u2019s the leader of the St. Louis Cardinals. And he\u2019s the leader on the field. But off the field, he became the leader last year,\u201d Cora said.\u201cVery proud of what he\u2019s done throughout his career. But I think last year was the highlight of his career.\u201dMolina is the third Puerto Rican-born player to win the award and fourth from the island. He joins Carlos Beltran (2013), Carlos Delgado (2006) and Edgar Martinez (2004).A nine-time All-Star, Molina is an eight-time Gold Glove Award winner and has spent all 15 of his big league seasons with the Cardinals.Clemente died on Dec. 31, 1972, when his airplane that was carrying supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua crashed after taking off from Puerto Rico.Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
