{"id": "Panthers proving they can win without throwing the ball deep", "paragraph": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Cam Newton and the Panthers are proving they can win without throwing the ball deep down the field.\nThe 2015 league MVP has attempted 16 passes \u2014 and completed just three \u2014 that have travelled longer than 20 yards in the air this season, according the NFL\u2019s Next Gen stats. That\u2019s far fewer than most other NFL quarterbacks. Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, for instance, has completed 17 of 42 passes beyond 20 yards, with eight of those going for touchdowns.\nNewton said the lack of vertical passing game isn\u2019t something he\u2019s concerned with entering Sunday\u2019s home game against the Ravens (4-3), especially with his team 4-2 this season.\n\u201cWhen you are moving the ball, people say why aren\u2019t you taking many shots downfield?\u201d Newton said. \u201cWhen you take too many shots downfield and it\u2019s not there and you start forcing the ball, they say why can\u2019t you protect the ball? So our thing is we turn our ears to mute and take what the defense is giving us. When we have opportunities to take shots down the field trust and believe nobody loves touchdowns more than I do \u2014 and if it\u2019s there I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d\nAdded Newton: \u201cIf not, you just live to fight another day.\u201d\nCoach Ron Rivera likes that approach, saying he is just fine with how Newton is playing. Newton has completed 11 touchdown passes this season and has four interceptions and has a solid 94.7 QB rating.\n\u201cI think the quarterback is very efficient with (the ball) right now,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to panic.\u201d\nThe formula seems to be working for the Panthers, who are winning games behind Newton\u2019s heroics.\nThree weeks ago against the Giants the eighth-year QB rallied Carolina back in the final seconds, leading a drive that set up Graham Gano\u2018s winning 63-yard field goal. This past Sunday Newton brought the Panthers back from a 17-0 deficit on the road against the Super Bowl champion Eagles with three TD drives to finish the game, earning him his 10th career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor on Wednesday.\nRivera said when the game is on the line Newton has the same mentality as Michael Jordan, a six-time NBA champion who many still consider the best basketball player of all time.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come up and say, \u2018Put it in my hands, coach. Trust me,'\u201d Rivera said of Newton. \u201cMichael Jordan used to say, \u2018Certain guys want the ball when it\u2019s crunch time. Other guys just don\u2019t seem to come off the picks the way they\u2019re supposed to.\u2019 I\u2019ve told that to Cam, and Cam has always wanted the ball.\u201d\nAlthough the Panthers still looking stagnant at times on offense \u2014 including the first three quarters against the Eagles when they managed just seven first downs and no points \u2014 Newton seems adjusting well to new offensive coordinator Norv Turner\u2019s scheme, which features more check downs and screen plays than the Panthers have typically run in the past.\n\u201cWhen we get into the logistic things of football, and what the defense is giving and what they aren\u2019t, you can\u2019t just go down and chuck the football downfield and just expect, \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t take shots in the game,'\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what good teams or offenses do. We don\u2019t let the defense dictate to us, we dictate to the defense. So that\u2019s been our approach.\u201d\nWith the emphasis focused on shorter routes, Newton is completing a career-high 65.6 percent of his passes, well above his career average of 58.9 percent.\nSo while Newton says he likes the big play as much as anyone, he seems fine with Turner\u2019s philosophy \u2014 as long as the Panthers are winning games.\n\u201cWhatever Norv and his offensive staff calls it\u2019s my job as the quarterback to execute it,\u201d Newton said. \u201cIf I see anything otherwise, it\u2019s my job to make the proper audible. If not, then run the play.\u201d\n Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
