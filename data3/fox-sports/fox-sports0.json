This is what it\u2019s supposed to feel like.\u201d\nA week after squandering a late 10-point lead at Northwestern and losing in overtime, the Huskers (1-6, 1-4 Big Ten) scored on three of their first four possessions on their way to a 28-0 lead.\nMinnesota made things interesting, though, scoring on three possessions in a row spanning the halves, with backup quarterback\u00a0Tanner Morgan\u00a0replacing\u00a0Zack Annexstad\u00a0to open the third quarter and leading two straight touchdown drives to pull the Gophers to 28-22.\nAdrian Martinez\u00a0hit\u00a0Stanley Morgan\u00a0Jr. for a 35-yard TD and passed to him again for a 2-point conversion to make it 36-22. The Huskers stopped Minnesota on fourth-and-goal at the 3 and then chewed 7 minutes off the clock before Barrett Pickering kicked a 32-yard field goal to make it a three-possession game with 7:53 left.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how this whole year has been. We\u2019re going to have to play well for four quarters,\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better every day. We\u2019re still not so good we can sleep on a lead or not play our best. So proud of this team. They could have quit a long time ago. They could have shut it down. This team every week does more of what we ask them, does it better, keeps getting better. That was a pretty good show out there today.\u201d\nNebraska rushed for 383 yards and totaled 659.\u00a0Devine Ozigbo\u00a0ran for 152 yards, Martinez for 125 and\u00a0Maurice Washington\u00a0for 109.\nMartinez completed 25 of 29 mostly short passes adding up to 276 yards and three TDs. Stanley Morgan caught 10 balls for 163 yards, both career highs.\nThe Gophers were without running back\u00a0Shannon Brooks, who was arrested last weekend on suspicion of misdemeanor assault for an altercation with his male roommate. Brooks, who was medically cleared to play after rehabbing an offseason knee injury, didn\u2019t make the trip.\nTanner Morgan was 11 of 16 for 214 yards and Annexstad 9 of 20 for 135. Gophers coach P.J. Fleck said Annextad had to leave the game because of an internal injury in his midsection. He was taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\u201cCongratulations to Coach Frost,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, everybody remembers your first. This team should be 5-1 or 4-2. We didn\u2019t stop them tonight at all. We didn\u2019t tackle well. We didn\u2019t set an edge.\u201d\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nMinnesota: A quarterback controversy may begin unfolding this week. Morgan gave the Gophers a spark. The Minnesota defense had no answer for Martinez and Co., though.\nNebraska: The defense\u2019s depth issue continues to show up in second halves. The Huskers seemed to tire for the second straight week. This team is much like Frost\u2019s teams at Central Florida. It\u2019s all about the offense.\nUP NEXT\nMinnesota hosts Indiana on Oct. 26.\nNebraska hosts Bethune-Cookman on Oct. 27.\n Help | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
