{"id": "Indiana, Purdue both face big tests Saturday before meeting a week later", "paragraph": "Indiana coach Tom Allen understands the challenges his team faces this weekend.\nNo. 4 Michigan is the Big Ten\u2019s highest-ranked team and the one most likely to carry the conference banner into the College Football Playoff, if any team does. The Wolverines have won nine straight since losing to No. 3 Notre Dame and need another win to set up a showdown with No. 9 Ohio State for a ticket to the Big Ten championship game.\nAllen, of course, also knows the refrain echoing throughout his home state: Indiana hasn\u2019t won at Michigan since 1967.\nNone of it matters to the Hoosiers, who ended a four-game losing streak Saturday and now need one more win to become bowl-eligible.\n\u201cWe changed our schedule for the very purpose of being at our best in weeks nine, 10, 11 and 12,\u201d Allen said Monday. \u201cWe really felt like last year for multiple reasons, it wasn\u2019t just one thing, but for multiple reasons we kind of ran out of juice and did not have the same energy at the end.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s victory over Maryland should give the Hoosiers (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) more than just an energy boost.\nThey desperately needed a home win to build some momentum for the home stretch and to give themselves a realistic chance of becoming bowl-eligible for the third time in four years.\nAllen made points perfectly clear to his players last week when he decided to discuss the postseason situation, something he did not do in 2017. Indiana responded to Allen\u2019s message by using Steve Scott\u2019s long run to set up a 42-yard field goal with 2:32 left and then forcing a late turnover to close out the crucial 34-32\u00a0win\u00a0over Maryland.\n\nNow comes the harder part, winning No. 6 at either Michigan this weekend or at home against bitter rival Purdue in\u00a0its home finale.\n\u201cAnxious for our guys to respond in the right way to be able to build off of this and take momentum into the biggest game of our season,\u201d Allen said. \u201cOur guys understand that.\u201d\nFor programs like Indiana\u2019s, this time of the season can be challenging as speculation runs rampant about bowl destinations and coaching changes.\nJust ask Purdue (5-5, 4-3), which is in a similar predicament, though, in part, for a very different reason.\nThe Boilermakers, who lost at Minnesota on Saturday, also need one win to become bowl-eligible. They host Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3) on Saturday before visiting Bloomington the following week for a potential winner-takes-all regular-season finale.\nThe chatter around Purdue became more complicated after Louisville fired coach Bobby Petrino on Sunday and Boilermakers coach Jeff Brohm immediately jumped to the top of his alma mater\u2019s wish list. Brohm was peppered with questions about the opening Monday and tried to downplay the rumors emanating from his hometown.\n\u201cI have a job, and we\u2019ve got work to do, and a lot of it. We\u2019re going to put forth the effort to do that,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tough opponent this week, and then we\u2019ve got to go to IU, and we\u2019re going to have to play well, and we\u2019re going to have to play much better than we did last week. So I\u2019m going to stay focused on that, and I\u2019m very appreciative of the job I have right now.\u201d\nBrohm has become a frequently mentioned candidate on the coaching carousel, especially after beating expectations each of his first two seasons at Purdue. Last year, he led the Boilermakers to a bowl game victory and last month Purdue blew out Ohio State in one of this season\u2019s most shocking upsets.\nBut Allen, like Brohm, has only one goal this week: Beating a good opponent this weekend so they don\u2019t have to fret over the stakes next weekend.\n\u201cWe know what they\u2019ve accomplished this year,\u201d Allen said, describing Michigan. \u201cThey\u2019re really playing at a high level, and Coach (Jim) Harbaugh\u2019s got them doing a lot of great things. So great opportunity, great challenge this weekend.\u201d\n\t130\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmber Searls-USA TODAY Sports | Amber Searls\t\t\t\t\tHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
