{"id": "Conference season takes a toll in the Pac-12", "paragraph": "There\u2019s talk every season about how the Pac-12 cannibalizes itself.Just last week, Oregon coach Mario Cristobal used the word following the Ducks\u2018 34-20 loss to Washington State in Pullman. Then Oregon fell 44-15 on the road at Arizona on Saturday, which was marked by dramatic conference upsets.After the chaos, the Cougars were still the only one-loss Pac-12 team left, and they have only a longshot of making the College Football Playoff.Conference coaches often point to parity in the Pac-12 as the reason that it\u2019s difficult for a league team to rise to the top of the national conversation. And yes, it seems antithetical that parity might be hurting the Pac-12, but the heart of the issue is the schedule.It\u2019s notable that no Pac-12 school has played in the CFP championship game since Oregon faced Ohio State following the 2014-15 season, the first year of the playoff. The ACC and the SEC are the only conferences to have teams represented in the playoffs each year since.Coincidentally, the three other Power 5 conferences, including the Pac-12, play a nine-game conference schedule, one more than the ACC and SEC.The nine-game league schedule has been criticized because it\u2019s obviously more difficult, and there\u2019s less likelihood that a team will finish undefeated \u2014 which lowers the odds of getting coveted playoff berths. That challenges a conference where some key matchups are played late.Stanford coach David Shaw pointed to how some Pac-12 teams will play a grueling stretch of consecutive conference games without an off week, while other conferences schedule less taxing nonconference games later in the year. Late season nonconference games in the Pac-12 tend to be against higher-profile opponents, like Notre Dame, he said.\u201cMy point, for the longest time, is to make sure all the conferences have very similar ways to schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way we can truly evaluate or compare.\u201dWashington coach Chris Petersen agreed the tough schedule has an impact, but said ultimately the playoffs should be expanded to include the possibility of a two-loss team making the field.\u201cWell, I think if there\u2019s that much parity, and you know you\u2019re going to have a team with at least two losses and you\u2019re out, it definitely hurts you. The answer is, if you\u2019re going to take a league that\u2019s got a lot of parity and you think it\u2019s still a really good league, you\u2019ve got to take the league champions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to expand that situation, but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201dParity becomes a focus on a day like last Saturday, when upsets ruled.\u2014 Oregon State pulled off the biggest, winning a conference game for the first time since 2016 with a 41-34 overtime victory on the road at Colorado.\u2014 Unranked Arizona downed the visiting Ducks, giving then-No. 19 Oregon back-to-back losses and three total league losses.\u2014 Arizona State toppled USC 38-35, ending the Trojans\u2018 19-game winning streak at the Coliseum and edging Clay Helton closer to the hotseat.\u2014 California defeated Washington 12-10 without scoring an offensive touchdown.\u2014 Washington State\u2019s 41-38 win over Stanford was also technically an upset because the Cardinal were a 3-point favorite at home.Cougars coach Mike Leach also pointed to the nine-game conference slate, while also suggesting the playoffs should be expanded. But he also said he believes the Pac-12 is really that good.\u201cI think our conference is the hardest one to win in every week,\u201d he said on Tuesday\u2019s Pac-12 teleconference.Ultimately, that parity may end up hurting Washington State because losses are dropping the Cougars\u2019 conference opponents out of the rankings. The Pac-12 had five teams in the AP Top 25 last week, and now there are just two.The taxing nine-game conference schedule could be hurting the Pac-12 more generally in the postseason. Last year, the league went just 1-8 in bowl games.Critics also point to frequent Thursday and Friday night games, as well as late-night Saturday starts, that are dictated by the Pac-12\u2019s television contracts. That means East Coast viewers don\u2019t necessarily see key games, putting the league\u2019s teams and star players at a disadvantage when it comes to poll voting or postseason award consideration.Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, whose team popped up to No. 16 in the rankings with a win over UCLA on Friday night, said he can\u2019t concern himself too much with how the Pac-12 stacks up against the other conferences.\u201cDon\u2019t really worry about that to be honest with you,\u201d Whittingham told reporters Monday. \u201cThe Pac-12 is competitive and everybody is beating each other up, but our world is the Pac-12 and so I don\u2019t really focus on any other stuff.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
