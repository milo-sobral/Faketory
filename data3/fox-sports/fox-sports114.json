North Carolina improved to 8-0 under Fedora against teams from the Football Championship Subdivision, winning those games by an average of almost 37 points per game.HAIL MARYMiles subbed in for Elliott at the end of the first half because he has a stronger arm and would be able to get the ball to the end zone.

The party continued after the game, where his father, mother and two sisters watched him answer questions.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid, you dream about playing college football, and you dream about scoring touchdowns and throwing it and running it,\u201d Miles said. \u201cFor it all to happen at the end and for your first throw to be a touchdown like that, it\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201dMILESTONE PERFORMANCEAdams became the 10th player in FCS history to pass for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the same season.
