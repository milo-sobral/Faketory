Ohtani is only the third Los Angeles Angels player to win the award, joining Mike Trout and Tim Salmon.\n\nOhtani received 25 of 30 first place votes and 137 total votes, compared to second-place Andujar who received 89 total votes. His elite play on both the mound and in the batter\u2019s box has drawn plenty of comparisons to Babe Ruth.\n\"This is something we haven't seen since Babe Ruth so I'm inclined to say [Shohei] Ohtani is the Rookie of the Year\u2026\"\nCarlos Pe\u00f1a makes the case for the @Angels two-way star to take home the @officialBBWAA AL Rookie of the Year award. #MLBNow pic.twitter.com/XUT1gZBonh\n\u2014 MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 12, 2018\nShoTime had already been named AL Rookie of the Year\u00a0by Baseball Digest, as he went 4-2 as a pitcher in the 10 games he started, ending with a 3.31 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 63 strikeouts over 51 innings. Although his season was cut short due to injury, his batting numbers were still comparable to that of his Rookie of the Year finalist counterparts in far fewer at-bats.\nShohei Ohtani is just the fourth Japanese-born player to earn Rookie of the Year honors. pic.twitter.com/mGD3pDISAj\n\u2014 MLB Stat of the Day (@MLBStatoftheDay) November 13, 2018\nHe led all A.L. rookies (min. 300 PA) in OPS (.925), on-base percentage (.361), and slugging percentage (.564) and posted the best rates of at-bats per home run (14.82) and RBI (5.34).

He joined Ruth as the only players to hit 15 homers while pitching at least 50 innings in a season. He\u00a0is also the second-fastest Angels rookie to reach 20 home runs, doing so in 91 non-pitching games this season.\nOhtani underwent Tommy John surgery after the season to repair his damaged UCL, taking him out of consideration to pitch in 2019. However, the 24-year-old is expected to be able to rejoin the team as a hitter early in the season. During the award show announcement on MLB Network, Ohtani said his recovery process has been going well and may even be a bit ahead of schedule.\nWill Shohei Ohtani be crowned the 2018 @officialBBWAA AL Rookie of the Year?\nThe @Angels star joined Greg, @Plesac19 and Carlos to chat before tonight's big announcement. pic.twitter.com/c6K2APqjM5\n\u2014 MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 12, 2018\nAdditionally, Ohtani\u00a0was the only player in the Majors to have multiple games of two home runs and a stolen base.
