{"id": "No. 23 LSU enters new season with high hopes, heavy hearts", "paragraph": "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Second-year LSU coach Will Wade has recruited his way into the national rankings.Time will tell if a No. 23 Tigers team relying on a sophomore point guard, a senior transfer from Oregon and trio of highly touted freshmen can fulfill that promise \u2014 all while they cope with the recent fatal shooting of a teammate.The death of forward Wayde Sims, a Baton Rouge native whose father also played for LSU, will be forever intertwined with the Tigers\u2019 season.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty glaring with him not there sometimes,\u201d Wade said. \u201cYou walk in the locker room, his locker is the exact same. \u2026 We took the team picture the other day, and we have his jersey in the middle \u2014 and that was what our guys wanted.\u201dThe Tigers hope to honor Sims\u2019 memory by winning, and they appear to have the talent to do so.Guard Tremont Waters was among the Southeastern Conference\u2019s most exciting players as a freshman, when he averaged about 16 points. Now he\u2019s practically an elder statesman on a team expecting big things from freshmen Naz Reid, Emmitt Williams and Ja\u2019vonte Smart.Reid, a 6-foot-10, 240-pound forward, and Williams, a 6-7, 215-pound forward, were both five-star recruits. Smart, a 6-4 guard, was a four-star recruit who was named Louisiana\u2019s best high school player the past three seasons.\u201cThe fans are in for a nice little show this year \u2014 not just from me but from the entire team,\u201d Waters said.Here are some of the story lines surrounding LSU as the Tigers head into this season, starting with a home game against Southeastern Louisiana on Nov. 6:TOP PROSPECTReid, who is widely viewed as first-round prospect for next summer\u2019s NBA draft, said he sees himself as a modern, dynamic big-man, with ball-handling ability and perimeter shooting to complement his size and power in the post. He names Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis as NBA players he studies in hopes of incorporating elements of their games into his.Reid that since he arrived at LSU, he has worked hardest on getting leaner  \u2014 losing about 25 pounds \u2014 and working on his outside shot.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of (future) pros in this conference,\u201d Reid said. \u201cSo I feel like if you don\u2019t do pro-like things, then you won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201dWade said Reid appears versatile enough to play on the wing and even bring the ball up the court.\u201cWe like it when Naz gets rebounds. We let him push the ball. He\u2019s a play-maker,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe can play really big when we do that. We can maneuver him around just because of his unique skill set, and he\u2019s got a very, very bright future ahead of him in basketball.\u201dGETTING DEFENSIVEThe Tigers are relying on Oregon transfer and England native Kavell Bigby-Williams to anchor their defense. The 6-11 senior from London appeared in 37 games for Oregon\u2019s 2017 Final Four team.He began his American college basketball career at the junior college level in Gillette, Wyoming, where he blocked 211 shots and shot 59.2 percent for a team that went 35-2 in the 2015-16 season.\u201cI know what I bring to the table,\u201d Bigby-Williams said. \u201cI know I\u2019m a defensive big, so I rebound, block shots, run the floor, bring energy to the team.\u201dSMART BETWade was gratified to learn that Smart, who averaged nearly 33 points as a high school senior, kept going to the gym to make 500 jump shots per day between the time his high school career ended and the time he arrived at LSU.Smart said it usually took him 45 minutes to an hour to make 500 shots. But his scoring isn\u2019t the only thing he brings to the Tigers. Waters said Smart\u2019s ball-handling is \u201cvery special.\u201d That means Waters won\u2019t always have to run the offense and will have stints when he can focus more on scoring.PERFERRED WALK-ONWill Reese arrived at LSU as a pitcher on the baseball team and appeared in 10 games during two seasons before deciding to hang up his cleats. But baseball coach Paul Mainieri suggested Wade give Reese a look. The 6-4 Reese, a standout player on two title-winning high school basketball teams in Louisiana, is now expected to see action as a reserve guard this season.\u201cI have a trust with him. He\u2019s a sharp guy, knows how to play. Very, very good defender,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHe\u2019s like the perfect walk-on.\u201dHelp | Press | Advertise With Us | Jobs | RSS | Site Map\nFS1 | FOX | FOX News | 21st Century FOX | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\u00a9 2018 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
