It\u2019s going to be difficult. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s going to be. We hope it will be OK and that we can play like we normally do.\u201dThe difficulties that the pitch might bring on Monday night, however, appears the only cloud on City\u2019s horizon at the moment. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have now won six of the seven games played since the surprise defeat against Lyon in the Champions League on 19 September, and go into the game against Spurs high on confidence.\u201cThese games [against the other top teams] are the most important ones. We have to go there and show our intent to stay on top. They will try to do the same because they are close [in the table and on points]. It\u2019s a big one.\u201dGuardiola was delighted with the team\u2019s performance in Kharkiv and with the first half in particular. The Spaniard described the first 45 minutes as \u201cincredible\u201d and added that \u201cthe first half was the best we have played in the last three seasons, since I\u2019ve been here\u201d.De Bruyne, however, was unable to agree with his manager, saying that it is difficult to compare one game to another. \u201cWe play so many games that it\u2019s difficult to say that,\u201d he said.\u201cEach game has different aspects. Shakhtar are a team that likes to play football so when we pressed them high it worked well for us. We should have scored more but to go away with 3-0 victory is good. We lost against Lyon so it was important to recover and now we want to be first in the group.\u201cThere are still three games to go and we have work to do. We\u2019ve one player more than we had last season, but I don\u2019t know if we are better equipped \u2013 about the same I\u2019d say.\u201dThe Belgian also praised how his teammates had played during his long injury absence. \u201cWe\u2019ve done well [without me], obviously most of them were games that we should have won but we\u2019ve done really well. We only lost the Lyon game so we\u2019ve been fine, but to be honest I didn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d"}
