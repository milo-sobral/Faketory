He insisted the penalties would not hurt the Iranian people.\u201cThese sanctions are the toughest ever put in place on the Republic of Iran,\u201d he said. The top diplomat in the US said the new sanctions were designed to \u201calter Iran\u2019s behavior\u201d and protect Israel and other countries.The re-imposition of sanctions follows Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which provided economic incentives in exchange for a verifiable end to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The unilateral rejection of the deal has gained very few supporters, though Pompeo claimed \u201cwe have built an enormous coalition to keep this world safe\u201d.The European Union in particular is setting up a route to bypass US sanctions in return for persuading Iran to continue on its non-nuclear path.The assertion that renewed sanctions will not hurt ordinary Iranians has been questioned. There are signs the Iranian people are on tenterhooks about the impact on their daily lives. Medical groups have warned that the penalties will lead to severe shortages of essential medicines, endangering thousands of lives.Pompeo\u2019s belligerent tone was matched by Trump, who announced the new sanctions on Friday with a tweeted picture in the style of Game of Thrones. It said: \u201cSanctions Are Coming November 5\u201d.As he left the White House on Sunday for an election rally in Macon, Georgia, Trump said the sanctions would damage the Iranian regime.\u201cThey are not doing very well, let me tell you,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference. When I came in office it looked like Iran would take over the Middle East, it was a question of literally less than years, very quickly, and now nobody is talking about that.\u201dThe Trump administration has agreed to grant eight nations exemptions to allow them temporarily to continue buying Iranian oil, without naming the countries. It is widely suspected that the list includes some of the biggest importers of Iranian crude, such as China and India.Asked to confirm the presence of those two nations on the list of exemptions, Pompeo sidestepped the question.\u201cWatch what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already taken more crude oil off the market than at any time \u2026 and the march to zero continues.\u201d"}
