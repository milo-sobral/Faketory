The two septuagenarian politicians have often expressed interest in physical combat but on Saturday they settled for rhetorical blows or, in the fistic vernacular, trash talk.Biden mocked Trump as an egotist destroying time-honoured and globally admired American values. Trump mocked Biden as \u201c1% Joe\u201d, a pitiful figure taken \u201coff the trash heap\u201d by Barack Obama.Biden entered the ring first, telling unionised workers and Democratic activists America\u2019s values were \u201cbeing shredded by a president who is all about himself\u201d. America was built on basic decency, he said, which was \u201cbeing shredded right now\u201d.The US had built \u201cthe great alliances in literally the history of the world\u201d over the past 70 years, Biden said, adding: \u201cBut my God, think of what\u2019s going on now.\u201cIt\u2019s all about Donald.\u201dThe 75-year-old former Delaware senator, two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, vice-president to Obama and frontrunner among possible 2020 candidates was speaking in support of Jacky Rosen, who is in a tight Senate race with the Republican Dean Heller.Biden and Rosen rallied with members of Culinary Union 226, which represents about 57,000 housekeepers, bartenders and other workers in the casinos and hotels of the city. Turnout from the heavily immigrant union was credited with giving Democrats key wins in Nevada in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the state.Biden spoke shortly before Trump, 72, mounted a rally for Heller several hundred miles away in rural Elko. In a tweet, the president said Heller had \u201cbecome a good friend\u201d who was \u201call about #MAGA\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.Trump also backed Adam Laxalt for governor. His race, against the Democrat Steve Sisolak, also remains close.Addressing supporters, Trump called Biden \u201c1% Joe\u201d, a reference to his failed in presidential runs, and said in 2008 Obama plucked Biden \u201coff of the trash heap and made him vice-president\u201d.Trump also boasted about the size of his crowd and said that though Biden drew only a few hundred in Las Vegas, \u201che was thrilled that\u2019s one of the biggest crowds he\u2019s ever had\u201d. He later repeated the jibes to reporters and said: \u201cI wish Joe Biden the best, I hope he\u2019s the nominee, actually.\u201dThe president wants immigration to be a defining election issue. On Thursday in Missoula, Montana, he said the midterms would be \u201can election of the caravan\u201d. That was a reference to a group of around 4,000 would-be migrants from Honduras which has reached Mexico.On Saturday in Nevada, Trump said Democrats backed an \u201cextremist immigration agenda\u201d. He had \u201calready figured out\u201d, he said, how to solve the problem of immigration and \u201cmake a lot of people happy\u201d. But he did not explain how.\u201cI think I\u2019ll keep it a little bit low-key until the election,\u201d he said.At a Friday night rally in Arizona, Trump said Democrats were \u201ctoo extreme and too dangerous\u201d to take control of Congress. Democrats are well placed to take the House but, according to nonpartisan analysts, look likely to leave the Senate in Republican hands.On Saturday, Trump told supporters he doubted a much-vaunted \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic victories would happen.\u201cAll the Democrats want is power and they\u2019ve got this blue wave deal going,\u201d he said. \u201cNot looking like a blue wave.\u201dNevada is attracting the big names. On Monday, Obama will campaign in the state, which he won in 2008 and 2012. During the 2014 midterms, Democrats stayed home and Republicans won key races."}
