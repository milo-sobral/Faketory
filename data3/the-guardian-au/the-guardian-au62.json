Using the hashtag #ThanksForServing, NewsCorp said it was fostering \u201ca movement to acknowledge the service of veterans, past and present, and the sacrifice of their families\u201d.But it immediately drew fire from veterans and groups representing them as out of touch with Australian values.Neil James, the head of the Australian Defence Association, called the move \u201ctokenistic\u201d and said it was a manifestation of American culture that was unlikely to translate well in Australia.\u201cThe first problem is that there\u2019s other forms of service to the community \u2026 like policemen and ambos, and so would you actually start a queue of such announcements? That\u2019s a real worry,\u201d he told ABC Radio Melbourne.James said publicly thanking veterans might be damaging to their health in some cases.\u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between embarrassing them and thanking them and, in some cases, where they\u2019re suffering a psychological illness, effusively thanking them in public might not necessarily help them,\u201d he said.Rodger Shanahan, a veteran who now works as a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, accused the government and organisations of using veterans for branding.He said Australia was in danger of reaching \u201cpeak veteran\u2019\u201d as governments, media and business all tried to capitalise.\u201cIt seems to be all about branding and veterans are the brand du jour,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they should dial it down a little.\u201dEven One Nation MP Pauline Hanson weighed in, saying she thought service people might be embarrassed by an acknowledgement. The independent senator Derryn Hinch also publicly opposed the proposal on Tuesday morning.By Tuesday afternoon, Virgin Australia chief executive John Borghetti had issued a statement saying the company would pause to consult.\u201cWe are very mindful of the response that our announcement about recognising people who have served in defence has had today, and it was a gesture genuinely done to pay respects to those who have served our country,\u201d he said.\u201cOver the coming months, we will be working consultatively with community groups and our own team members who have served in defence to determine the best way forward.\u201cIf this consultative process determines that public acknowledgement of their service through optional priority boarding is not appropriate, then we will certainly be respectful of that.\u201dHis statement did not mention the inflight announcement plans, but a spokeswoman said they would also be part of the consultations.Australia\u2019s veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, welcomed the Virgin announcement on Sunday, but acknowledged many veterans would sooner embrace discounted airfares.\u201cAustralians, by nature, tend to keep their light under a bushel,\u201d Chester said on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cSome would be happy to get on the plane without anyone knowing they are there.\u201dShanahan said the veterans\u2019 community was a very broad church \u2013 it included people who had served just one day in the military through to people like himself who had served on multiple deployments overseas.\u201cMost of my cohort would rather not be defined by their military service,\u201d he said. \u201cThey find this kind of acknowledgement disconcerting.\u201dShanahan argued that people got carried away with the veteran identity while other groups, such as paramedics and aged care workers, who also served their communities went unrecognised.Some of these groups routinely saw much more trauma than Australian veterans.\u201cThere is a narrative that veterans are highly traumatised, have seen horrible things in hostile environments \u2013 and some have \u2013 but it\u2019s a small proportion [of Australian veterans,\u201d he said.\u201cThere seems to be this disturbing desire to attach yourself to this term \u2018veterans\u2019. I would much prefer we recognised veterans in a laidback way, and we do that through Anzac Day.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be thanked for my service. I gave them good service and they looked after me.\u201dThe Morrison government has made several announcements aimed at veterans since the Invictus Games, as News Corp ramps up its campaign.It has promised a UK-style veterans\u2019 covenant, which includes a discount card and lapel pin so participating businesses can offer discounts or benefits to veterans.\u201cWe acknowledge the important contribution veterans have made to keeping our country safe and the role they play in our community. Once the veterans have their cards and lapel pins, they will simply need to present them during the boarding process to be given priority boarding and be recognised on board,\u201d Borghetti said when initially announcing Virgin\u2019s initiative.A spokesman for Qantas said the airline had the \u201cutmost respect for current and former defence force personnel\u201d and special announcements were made on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.\u201c[But] we\u2019re conscious that we carry a lot of exceptional people every day, including veterans, police, paramedics, nurses, firefighters and others, and so we find it difficult to single out a particular group as part of the boarding process [with the exception of passengers with special needs].\u201dOn Thursday the government announced it would spend $500m to extend the Australian War Memorial to include exhibits acknowledging recent conflicts and missions, such as Iraq and Timor.On Friday Morrision announced plans for a new veterans\u2019 employment commitment to be rolled out to businesses that want to employ veterans.\u201cWe want to translate Australia\u2019s culture of respect for veterans into action. Simply put, hiring a veteran is good for business,\u201d Morrison said. "}
