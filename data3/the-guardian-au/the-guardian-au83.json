But \u201ca swallow does not a summer make\u201d, she added. \u201cThe fact that I exist should not be an excuse.\u201dMerkel, the country\u2019s first female chancellor, highlighted the fact that only 30.9% of politicians in the current Bundestag were female, down from 36.5% in the previous one.\u201cThat\u2019s the proportion of women that Sudan has in its parliament,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cI think that the proportion of women in our parliaments is a basic issue of our democracy.\u201dWomen are also few and far between in the highest echelons of the country\u2019s businesses. While 90% of the biggest listed companies in the US have two women on their boards, in Germany only 17% meet this criteria.\u201cI hope it will become a matter of course for men and women to share work, child-raising and housework equally and no one will be forced into a role or a specific task because of his or her gender,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cAnd I hope we won\u2019t have to wait 100 years to achieve that.\u201dMerkel listed some of the progress that had been made in recent years such as providing better childcare and maternity leave. Merkel, who is a physicist by training, added that girls should be encouraged to choose future-oriented jobs in technology.As for her own role, she acknowledged to roaring applause she had made a contribution: \u201cNobody laughs any more if a girl says she wants to become a chancellor.\u201d"}
