Like New Australia before it, this utopia was doomed from the start.Titled 7231, the resulting film is about 16 hours long, set to hypnotic strings with eerie prose narration and projected on loop. This is part two of Giraud and Siboni\u2019s The Unmanned: an epic, ongoing art program that continues this year at Mona.In the first season, exhibited in February, the artists grappled with a history of computation in reverse through eight films you can still watch snippets of online. With the second season, the Everted Capital \u2013 a series of films and sculptures that opened this month \u2013 they\u2019re speculating on a history of capitalism in reverse.The sculptures are finely crafted, and the film hypnotic \u2013 but it\u2019s a conceptually difficult show, made no more accessible by the exhibition description, which describes it using words like \u201cpeculiar\u201d, \u201cgruelling\u201d and \u201cmore poetry than prose\u201d. The artists prefer it that way.\u201cWe seem to always ask \u2018why?\u2019, and \u2018what is the reasons for things?\u2019,\u201d Giraud says, when pressed. \u201cMore than \u2018why?\u2019, I\u2019m interested in getting people to reflect on \u2018why we ask why?\u2019.\u201d\u201cOur main concern is how we can change the way we think of the future, in order to change ourselves in the present,\u201d Giraud explains, when pressed again. \u201cLate-stage capitalism is just working on its own eschatology. It hyperventilates on its own power to destroy.\u201dRather than trying to save the planet by abandoning capitalism and going backwards, the artists ask what would happen if we pushed everything further, and reclaimed the future instead. \u201cCurrency entirely changed our value system and our space. So what are we going to do to currency that will change it again?\u201d Giraud asks. \u201cCan we just mourn the earth, and then step forward into something else?\u201dEach season of the Unmanned has a prologue or \u201caxiom\u201d, and for The Everted Capital it\u2019s another film. For this one, the artists gathered a menagerie of non-human animals that had all, at one point, been traded (including a beetle, a snake, an ostrich, an eagle), placed them in a six-metre sphere-shaped enclosure (overseen by animal handlers, I\u2019m assured), and filmed them with a military grade thermal imaging camera.Giraud refers to it as an \u201cecosystem of currency\u201d; like the rest of the exhibition, it\u2019s hypnotic, unsettling, and difficult to immediately wrap your head around.To get from the axiom to the main room, the visitor walks through a hole in the wall that looks like it\u2019s been punched in by a giant. The 16-hour film is projected on the back wall, in front of which lies an enormous white plinth that holds two separate collections of sculptures; adding further complication, these sculptures comprise the \u201caxiom\u201d and first episode of the program\u2019s third season, titled The Form of Not.The axiom is a set of \u201cblades\u201d, conceived of by artificial intelligence. The artists inputted thousands of images of man-made blades into a computer program, which used that information to design millions of its own \u2013 24 of which were exquisitely crafted by a studio in Switzerland, who constructed the 3D versions from materials such as glass, obsidian, forged iron and prehistoric bone.The second group of sculptures, Face Value, seem to hang from a complex network of rope, and burst into (and in some cases, below) the plinth; some are props from the 16-hour film, and others have been moulded from 3D prints of ancient masks \u2013 the faces represent coinage \u2013 and cuneiforms from Mona\u2019s own collection.The artists have incorporated wax, resin, salt and mildew into each: materials that are mined and traded in the film, as the society reverts to capitalism; and which, in real life, represent both preservation and decay. The effect is a cold one in the eerie, cavernous space, even though the sculptures are in some ways alive: some drip, others crystallise, and a few are growing over with mould. (Museums being sterile environments, the artists were only allowed to bring in spores if they sealed them with plastic. \u201cIn the end, [the gallery] won,\u201d Giraud shrugs.)Curator Nicole During has been working with the artists on the project for \u201ca long time\u201d, but admits she only recently began to understand \u201cparts of it\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ll never truly understand it. That\u2019s the thrilling thing \u2026 They\u2019re not making work like [other artists]. They\u2019re making their own kind of world.\u201d (The next episode of The Everted Capital will be set in 1971, and will unfold in Japan next year.)The Unmanned launched on the same day as another Mona commission, Your Shadow Rising, from British painter and sculptor Toby Ziegler.It marks the first time six exhibitions have been held over one summer at the gallery, which is still basking in the literal glow of new wing, Pharos, and its series of astounding and immersive James Turrell installations. This flurry of activity, compounded by the major show Zero, is well-timed: a public showcase of the gallery\u2019s tourism potential, as it attempts to win DA approval for a new on-site hotel.It\u2019s easy to find common threads between The Unmanned and Your Shadow Rising. Ziegler\u2019s work deals in themes of fire, trauma, time and transformation, and two of his major sculptures relied, like the sculptures in the Unmanned, on 3D modelling and printing for their creation; similarly, for his exquisite corpse video series It Will Soon Be Over, Ziegler input images into an AI \u2013 in this case, reverse image search engines \u2013 and left the technology to create its own art.He refers to his work as \u201ca negotiation between figuration and abstraction \u2026 but ultimately you want people to have to negotiate it for themselves, as well.\u201dChallenging the visitor, or leaving them with more questions than answers, seems to fit the ethos of Mona, which is known for its unconventional \u2013 or intentionally provocative \u2013 curation.But the idea that Mona sets out to poke the art world grates on curator Durling. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to do things \u2018outside of the box\u2019. \u2026 I can\u2019t make shows any other way, we can\u2019t work with artists any other way,\u201d she says.And don\u2019t get her started on the museum\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d unofficial slogan, the museum of sex and death.\u201cIt took us years to live that down,\u201d she says, with a grimace. \u201cI don\u2019t know who said [it first]. We use shorthand a lot, internally \u2026 and somebody said it to somebody in the media once, and off it went.\u201d (The slogan is not entirely un-earned: when I revisit the general collection later that day I discover two seperate pieces that depict skeletons copulating.)\u201c[Walsh] is great at summarising, condensing, distilling [ideas] into these great grabs,\u201d she says. \u201cIs [Mona] a reaction to other museums that he\u2019s seen? Possibly, yeah. But also, this is authentically him.\u201d\u2022 Fabien Giraud and Rapha\u00ebl Siboni\u2019s The Unmanned, and Your Shadow Rising by Toby Ziegler, are open now at Mona in Hobart"}
