It was a legacy of three NFL games having been staged there in two weeks, together with last month\u2019s Anthony Joshua title fight.Tottenham have committed to playing a further seven matches at Wembley \u2013 five in the league; two in the Champions League \u2013 because of the delays to the construction of their new stadium and there are concerns about the deterioration of the turf.\u201cEverybody knows how difficult it is to play at Wembley against one of the best sides in England and with a pitch in those conditions,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt was a bit complicated. Everyone knew how the pitch was. The conditions were not even close to perfect. It was the same for both teams. We knew we had to try to win anyway.\u201dSilva described the result as a \u201cbig win\u201d and he acknowledged how City had now ticked off their away fixtures at Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs. \u201cIt\u2019s important to win these games, although we drew at Anfield,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThey all now have to come and play at the Etihad, which is a bit better for us in front of our home fans.\u201cWe know we are one of the best teams in the world and we know our qualities. We want to keep going this way. It helps us a lot that we have won the title, previously. The team has a lot of confidence in all the players and we know what we are capable of. We know we can still improve a lot. We have to stay concentrated.\u201d"}
