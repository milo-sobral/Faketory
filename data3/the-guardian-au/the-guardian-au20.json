The residents were adamant that something had to be done to stop the disturbance.\u201dThe ban, which is likely to be difficult to enforce, was criticised on social media for effectively censoring music and introducing rules that might not be applied to indie and rock festivals.Councillor Kirsten Hearn, Haringey\u2019s cabinet member for the environment, said: \u201cWireless festival is a world-class urban event that helps to fund the park the whole year round and makes a major cultural contribution to Haringey. We will work to address these [concerns] with residents and partners at Finsbury Park.\u201d"}
