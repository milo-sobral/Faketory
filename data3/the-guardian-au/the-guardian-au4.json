However, the Mercedes driver is almost unbeatable on this circuit and responded to the unexpectedly stiff challenge of the two Ferraris by setting a track record to claim pole position for Sunday\u2019s US Grand Prix.Hamilton set the pace but Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Sebastian Vettel soon shoved him down to third place. It looked like the Briton might deliver his worst qualifying performance in Austin since 2013, the only year he has failed to win here, but he roared back in the third qualifying period with a time of 1min 32.237sec.\u201cClearly very intense,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cToday in practice the Ferraris looked like they had made some improvements. Once we got to Q3 it was about not leaving a millisecond on the track, basically.\u201dHamilton\u2019s title rival, Vettel, was second, and less than a 10th of a second slower but an intriguing duel at the head of the pack may not materialise since he will start in fifth position as the result of a penalty for breaking a red flag rule on Friday. That is an ominous sign for his prospects of extending the championship battle for at least another week, given that in its six previous years the Austin grand prix has never been won by a driver starting outside the front row.Still, Vettel was philosophical. \u201cSurprisingly close. I don\u2019t think we expected it to be that close,\u201d he said. \u201cBit of a shame to just miss out.\u201dHamilton is chasing his fifth successive victory \u2013 a streak he also achieved en route to winning the 2014 title \u2013 and his seventh win in eight races. Among the potential outcomes that would see the 33-year-old champion retain the trophy is victory if Vettel finishes third or lower. Few would bet against the first half of that equation, at least, at a circuit where Hamilton has won five grands prix, including the past four.After dominating the first two practice sessions in wet conditions on Friday while Vettel struggled, Hamilton was only the third fastest in final practice under foreboding grey clouds. Vettel, meanwhile, clocked the best time, albeit only fractionally better than his teammate, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, and Hamilton.Given that Mercedes have a faster car than Ferrari on wet surfaces, an unexpected improvement in the weather on Saturday was at least a welcome and much-needed piece of good news for Vettel. \u201cThe Ferraris are obviously really quick,\u201d Hamilton said.Forecast earlier in the week to be rainy, race day looked likely to be dry \u2013 and sunnier than Vettel\u2019s disposition on Friday. The German was given a three-place grid penalty for failing to slow sufficiently for a red flag during the first practice session while gravel was being cleared from the track.He railed against the verdict and the rule but it was the latest in a string of unforced Ferrari blunders that have all but handed the title to Hamilton, who, as last year, has grown stronger as the season has gone on. \u201cAfter the weeks we had I\u2019m pretty pleased we are back in range,\u201d Vettel said.Hamilton has a 67-point lead with four grands prix remaining, meaning he needs eight more points than Vettel to seal his fifth title. That would draw him level with Juan Manuel Fangio and in sight of Michael Schumacher\u2019s record tally of seven. Vettel, 31, has four championships but none since 2013.Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, believes Ferrari may have the faster car. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, third-fastest in qualifying, starts in second thanks to Vettel\u2019s penalty. The Finn will be on ultra-soft tyres that may give him an advantage at the start, with Hamilton and Vettel on super-softs that provide less grip. \u201cWe\u2019re lacking a bit of straight-line speed and it\u2019s going to be very difficult to defend against the Ferraris. That\u2019s my worry,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said you cannot write them off.\u201dHamilton, though, is relaxed. In the post-session press conference he initially appeared to describe his best lap as \u201cperfection\u201d before \u2013 in true perfectionist style \u2013 walking back that assertion. Near-perfect, though, would be fair comment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a different feeling today coming in. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know if I slept longer or what but I was in a different headspace going into qualifying, which is weird, but it was a good one.\u201d"}
