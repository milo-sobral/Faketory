The majority will only recall South Africa literally throwing away a game they should have won and the dubious late decision not to penalise Owen Farrell for exactly the type of hit World Rugby wants to outlaw.Within the England camp, nevertheless, this may yet prove a small but pivotal breakthrough in terms of their 2019 prospects. Its value lay not in the quality of the rugby \u2013 neither side were anywhere close to outstanding \u2013 but in the red rose character it revealed. Sometimes it is slightly fortunate, against-the-grain success that gives teams more inner belief than days when victory is squeezed more smoothly from the tube.Of course, everything is relative: if New Zealand are allowed the same first-half ball and territory they will win by 25 points. When they analyse the match tape, even so, the All Blacks will also note England\u2019s refusal to buckle and their doggedness in adversity. Given how many influential bodies are unavailable to Eddie Jones the confidence generated by their second-half revival will be substantial.Even the great Harry Houdini would not have relished the padlocked straitjacket in which the Springboks had their opponents imprisoned. If their great escape, secured by a nerveless Farrell penalty, owed much to Springbok profligacy and the erratic lineout throwing of Malcolm Marx it was also notable for England\u2019s refusal to bow to the seemingly inevitable.With just about everyone expecting a New Zealand victory this weekend that is not the worst trait for Jones\u2019s squad to be developing. Mark Wilson, George Kruis, Ben Moon and Harry Williams may not be starry names but the grit and character that confounded the Boks are precisely the qualities upon which consistent Test packs are built. With Courtney Lawes and Manu Tuilagi hoping to be fit to face the All Blacks, Jones\u2019s post-match tone suggested the world\u2019s best team can be made to stop and think. \u201cI said to the boys after the game that I can\u2019t wait. They are the benchmark for world rugby; the team you want to play against. You only know where you are in the world when you play against the All Blacks.\u201dIt is set to be a contrasting sort of contest; New Zealand will be smarter and more clinical than the Boks unless England cut them off at source. With a couple of tweaks \u2013 perhaps Sam Underhill for the injured Tom Curry on the openside flank and a front-row reshuffle \u2013 it is not a game Jones sees as unwinnable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe you can beat them. You\u2019ve got to understand where they\u2019re weak and strong and be disciplined in your gameplan. New Zealand are going to be different. They\u2019re going to want to run the ball from everywhere and put air on the ball. We\u2019re going to have to be a different team next week.\u201dGiven South Africa beat the All Blacks in Wellington and should also have toppled them in Pretoria, the long-awaited return of the silver fern to south-west London will certainly not lack for pre-match conjecture. Take your pick from England\u2019s new defence coach, John Mitchell, up against his compatriots, Will Carling back in the England fold as a leadership adviser and Farrell looking to replicate last year\u2019s Lions\u2019 second Test success in Wellington.Underpinning it all, too, will be England\u2019s rising sense they are not that far away from taking a giant leap. \u201cThe belief you get from winning those tight games is enormous,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt just makes everyone feel better and means we won\u2019t have to pick them up this week. I didn\u2019t need this result to make me believe we can beat the All Blacks \u2013 I thought we could beat the All Blacks back in 2016. Nothing has changed, mate.\u201dJones insists he still felt confident at half-time on Saturday, despite South Africa having enjoyed 78% territory and almost as much possession in the first 40 minutes. His rationale was that, psychologically, the Boks were under more pressure having not nailed their numerous chances. The most glaring came when England were down to 14 men, with Maro Itoje in the sin-bin, and defending a South Africa lineout five metres out which Marx proceeded to overthrow. \u201cWhat I was really pleased about was that 10 minutes when Maro went to the bin,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI think we won it 3-0. To do that against a side that should\u2019ve beaten New Zealand twice in a row is not bad.\u201d With a few playful jabs at the media thrown in \u2013 \u201cYou guys love sacking coaches, that\u2019s what you live for. I know what would make you guys happy\u201d \u2013 Jones has rarely appeared more upbeat after any fixture since he took the England job. As far as he was concerned, the Farrell hit was just \u201ca good solid tackle\u201d and another apparent high challenge from Jonny May in the hectic closing moments was similarly glossed over.It was left to the former French national coach Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, among others, to speculate on the reaction had Farrell\u2019s hit been made by a Frenchman, a Fijian or a Samoan. If the game is serious about reducing tackle height a penalty should have been awarded but fortune, on this occasion, favoured the brave.England: Daly; Nowell (Ashton, 65), Slade, Te\u2019o (Ford, 73), May; Farrell (co-capt), Youngs (Care, 65); Hepburn (Moon, h/t), Hartley (co-capt, George, 57), Sinckler (Williams, 65), Kruis, Itoje, Shields (Ewels, 77), Curry (Mercer, 42), Wilson.Pens: Farrell 4.Sin bin: Itoje (16)South Africa:\u00ac\u2020Willemse; Nkosi (Esterhuizen, 60), Kriel, De Allende (Jantjes, 77), Dyantyi; Pollard, Van Zyl (Papier, 75); Kitshoff (T Du Toit, 65), Marx (Mbonambi, 75), Malherbe (Louw, 65), Etzebeth (Snyman, 42), PS Du Toit, Kolisi (capt; De Jager, 65), Vermeulen, Whiteley.Try: Nkosi.
