All four are charged with traveling to incite or participate in riots. Attorney information for the defendants could not immediately be found.The men allegedly took actions with the \u201cintent to incite, organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on riots\u201d last year in Charlottesville and in the California cities of Huntington Beach, Berkeley and San Bernardino, according to a complaint from the US attorney\u2019s office.\u201cRAM members violently attacked and assaulted counter-protesters at each of these events,\u201d the complaint said.Prosecutors have described the Rise Above Movement as a militant white supremacist group that espouses antisemitic and other racist views and meets regularly to train in boxing and other fighting techniques.The latest arrests come just weeks after the indictments of four other California members of Ram for allegedly inciting the Virginia riot.In August 2017, they made their way to the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville with their hands taped, \u201cready to do street battle\u201d, the US attorney Thomas Cullen said at a news conference announcing the charges earlier this month.Hundreds of white nationalists descended on Charlottesville in part to protest against the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Clashes erupted on 11 August as a crowd of white nationalists marching through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans encountered a small group of counter-protesters.The next day, more violence broke out between counter-protesters and attendees of the Unite the Right rally, which was believed to be the largest gathering of white nationalists in at least a decade. Street fighting exploded before the scheduled event could begin and went on for nearly an hour in view of police until authorities forced the crowd to disperse.After authorities forced the rally to disband on 12 August, Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters.The death toll rose to three when a state police helicopter that had been monitoring the event crashed, killing two troopers."}
