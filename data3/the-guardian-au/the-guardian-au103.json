It\u2019s their initiative and we\u2019re pleased to be part of it,\u201d the Australian prime minister said.\u201cWe will be working with Pacific Island nations at their invitation wherever we have that opportunity consistent with the programs that we\u2019re running. Those programs are cultural programs, they\u2019re educational programs, they\u2019re strategic defence programs, they\u2019re communications and infrastructure and the cable and all of these sorts of measures. We\u2019re looking to build up the Pacific.\u201dPence also used a speech to the summit to implicitly warn Pacific nations off accepting financial help from China. He said infrastructure loans, which have been deployed by Beijing with Pacific countries, had \u201copaque\u201d terms, and threatened the sovereignty of small nations.\u201cProjects they support are often unsustainable and poor quality. Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty,\u201d Pence warned. \u201cProtect your interests, preserve your independence and just like America, always put your country first.\u201dVery few details are currently available about the costs of the Manus Island project, and how they will be balanced between the development partners.The American posture at Apec fuels tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have manifested in a tit-for-tat trade war since the middle of the year.China used a meeting with the new Australian prime minister at Asean earlier this week to signal a reset on relations after a period of tension sparked by an Australian crackdown on Chinese influence. Morrison met the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, in Singapore but has not yet met the Chinese president.Morrison used his opening speech at Apec to push back on the US-China trade war, and implicitly criticise the protectionism of the Trump administration. He said open markets and trade liberalisation helped lift people out of poverty.While Australia is welcoming the Pacific pivot by the US and Japan over the past week as a win, Morrison\u2019s first foray into summit season as prime minister has been overshadowed by a rolling diplomatic row about Australia moving its embassy in Israel.The controversy began with a public warning from the Indonesian trade minister that Jakarta would not sign off on a free trade deal with Canberra if the embassy move proceeded. That was followed by a suggestion from the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, that relocating the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would add to the cause of terrorism.Mahathir\u2019s comments triggered strong pushback by Australian ministers on Friday. The deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, accused Mahathir of having form in making \u201cderogatory comments\u201d about Jews in the past, including calling them \u201chook-nosed\u201d, questioning the number of people killed in the Holocaust and banning the Holocaust film Schindler\u2019s List.Government conservatives have lined up to declare Australia should move the embassy, and make its own foreign policy decisions as a sovereign nation regardless of any diplomatic blowback. Morrison said this week a final decision on the embassy relocation will be made by Christmas.As well as rolling controversy about the Israel shift, Morrison\u2019s Pacific pivot has also been queried by Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the former minister for international development and the Pacific.Ahead of this weekend\u2019s Apec summit in Port Moresby, the prime minister unveiled a $2bn infrastructure financing facility for the Pacific as part of new measures designed to project Australia as the region\u2019s principal security and development partner.But the former frontbencher, who lost her spot in the Liberal leadership convulsion, said the new Australian loan facility raises concerns, because it adds to debt in the region. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a situation where one debtor is swapped for another.\u201dEarlier in the year, when she still held the Pacific portfolio, Fierravanti-Wells blasted China for using using concessional loans to boost its influence, and for building useless infrastructure projects, like roads to nowhere.She said debt, and debt sustainability, was now a significant concern for Pacific countries, troubling the international community, multilateral banks and the Pacific Islands Forum grouping.\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to look at infrastructure, and that\u2019s very important \u2013 undersea cables and all those things \u2013 but at the village level, the things that really matter are the school, the community hall and the hospital. Because if they can\u2019t stand the next cyclone or storm then, for that village or community, it\u2019s really hard for them to pick themselves up again.\u201d"}
