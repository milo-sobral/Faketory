would override state bans on political donations", "paragraph": "NSW legislation that places lower spending caps on third-party campaign groups is being challenged in the high court\nPaul Karp\n\nSat

groups \u2013 such as unions and charities \u2013 than the caps for political parties, are unconstitutional because they are designed to handicap \u201cdisfavoured voices\u201d, unions have argued.Unions NSW has made the submission to the high court in a challenge that could become Australia\u2019s equivalent to the United States\u2019 Citizens United case, which will decide the constitutionality of restrictions on third-party political campaigns in state and federal law.The case is the second chapter in a long-running antagonism between unions and the Coalition government, after Unions NSW won a high court challenge in 2013 against a law providing that only electors could make political donations, effectively banning union and corporate donations.Unions NSW and five of its member unions are challenging the Berejiklian government\u2019s Electoral Funding Act, which restricts registered third-party campaigners to spending $500,000 in the six months before an election, a cut of more than 50% compared with the $1.05m limit in the law it replaced.By comparison, political parties can spend up to $11.4m if they run candidates in every seat or $1.3m if they run an upper house ticket and 10 or fewer lower house candidates.The unions, represented by the former commonwealth solicitor general Justin Gleeson, say the law breaches the implied freedom of political communication in the commonwealth constitution, which also governs state electoral laws.That is because the law has \u201ca discriminatory effect on certain sources of political communication or political viewpoints\u201d, they submitted.Their submissions warn that the spending cap will handicap unions, religious groups, charities, ethnic associations, crowdfunding entities and business organisations in expressing political views on behalf of members.The unions argued that in precedent cases the court had shown the correct approach to permissible restrictions was to consider whether laws were designed to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d by facilitating equality of access to the political process.But a law that \u201caffords political parties a privileged position in political debate is not compatible with our constitutionally prescribed system of government\u201d, their submissions said.\u201cFar from simply preventing domination of the debate by powerful corporations or well-resourced citizens, the [third-party campaigner] expenditure cap will in practice restrict non-wealthy voices in their attempts to channel their limited individual political power into advertising campaigns of sufficient scale to reach state electors.\u201dThe unions acknowledged that political parties were unlike other interest groups because they tried to get candidates elected.They refuted the idea that that created \u201csome greater entitlement to communicate their views\u201d, arguing that it would undermine the ability for external groups to be a check on majoritarianism and the incumbency of current elected officials.In its defence, the NSW government submitted that the purpose of the law was \u201cto limit the influence \u2026 [on] the electoral process of large amounts of money by reducing \u2026 the demand for large donations\u201d.The NSW special minister of state, Anthony Roberts, had told parliament the purpose of lowering the cap was to \u201cguard against third parties dominating election campaigns\u201d.The new cap would allow \u201cthird party campaigners to reasonably present their case while ensuring that the caps are in proportion to those of parties and candidates who directly contest elections\u201d, he said in his second reading speech.The NSW government \u2013 represented by the solicitor general Michael Sexton \u2013 argued that the unions had proceeded on \u201cthe erroneous assumption that equality of opportunity to participate in an electoral contest requires equal treatment of those who are directly engaged in the contest and those who are not so engaged\u201d.It said \u201cdifferential treatment of parties and candidates is not of itself illegitimate\u201d.That is because the constitution protects a choice \u201cbetween candidates for office \u2026 not a choice between ideas, policies, views or beliefs\u201d.An expert panel on political donations convened by the government had \u201cstrongly agree[d] that political parties and candidates should have a privileged position in election campaigns\u201d because they were \u201cdirectly engaged in the electoral contest\u201d, and were \u201cthe only ones able to form government and be elected to parliament\u201d, the submissions said.The NSW government noted that political parties had to spend money on the \u201cpractical cost of being (serious) candidates\u201d including advertising, distributing how-to-vote cards, manning polling stations and organising volunteers.They said the unions had failed to show that third-party campaigners were not given \u201csufficient scope to run campaigns to influence voting at an election\u201d."}
