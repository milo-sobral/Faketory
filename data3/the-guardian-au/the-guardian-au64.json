The 31-year-old had received counselling during the week and was in tears during the pre-match minute\u2019s silence, but responded with a performance full of guts and resilience.\u201cWe have had some great times,\u201d Schmeichel said of his team\u2019s exploits under Vichai\u2019s eight-year ownership. \u201cIt felt like a cup final. I haven\u2019t really known a feeling like it on the pitch. I am really glad to have won \u2026 I think everyone is relieved more than anything.\u201c[The day was] emotional, yes, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives you a certain strength. It is an emotional day and an emotional time but there was no question I was going to play.\u201dSchmeichel confirmed he had witnessed the horrifying moment when the helicopter transporting Vichai fell to the ground shortly after taking off. Eyewitness reports suggested he sprinted out of the stadium in an attempt to assist and he said the experience is one that will never leave him.\u201cI spoke to somebody [for support],\u201d he said. \u201cI was on the pitch, I waved him off, I saw it all happen. It was something that will stay with me, unfortunately. But the club have been great and everybody has received the support they need. It is not a nice memory but I have had all the support I need.\u201dLeicester saw out the win with few alarms after Demarai Gray\u2019s 55th-minute goal, defending resolutely amid spells of Cardiff pressure. Schmeichel explained it had not been an occasion for intricate strategies and that the emphasis had been on mastering the intense feelings that had occupied them.\u201cThere was no real need for gameplans or tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about controlling our emotions. We talked about having to just stick together and be what we have always been \u2013 a family. We talked about how proud we are of being here, of being part of what he has built.\u201dThe squad and staff travelled to Bangkok straight from Cardiff to attend Vichai\u2019s funeral and their manager, Claude Puel, knows there will be difficult times after their return. Leicester host Burnley in what is likely to be another highly-charged occasion on Saturday and Puel believes the current experience will change them. \u201cThey are growing as people and it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAfterwards we will not be the same men and I think together we have to move on, to manage this emotion, and to keep the right way.\u201d"}
