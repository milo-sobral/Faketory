Expressing their anger and sorrow, many blamed the president for the attack.Young and old from all walks of life marched on Tuesday to remember the 11 Jewish people who died in the Saturday morning shooting. A suspect appeared in court on Monday.Nearby, Trump reportedly met Jewish leaders \u2013 much to the consternation of those on hand to march. Over loudspeakers, organizers accused the president of emboldening \u201ca growing white nationalist movement\u201d with hateful speech towards Jews and other minorities including African Americans, the LGBTQ community and immigrants.Participants carried signs denouncing Trump and asserting the resilience of the community. Organizers led those on hand in songs sung in Hebrew and taken from Bible verse, translating in part: \u201c I will build this world from love \u2026\u201dOrganizers asked participants to not speak to the sizeable throng of reporters on hand. One marcher, a physician at a children\u2019s hospital, declined to give his name but in somber tones recalled his initial reaction to news of the killings.\u201cAs soon as I hear what happened, I cried,\u201d he said, as he marched. Asked if such an attack would at least lead to a decrease in hateful rhetoric that has spiked in recent years, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I certainly hope so.\u201dNot all demonstrators were reluctant to speak. Antoniette Hartsfeld, a 22-year-old dance major at a local university, said she had been immediately fearful for friends from Squirrel Hill.\u201cI was terrified for friends living here,\u201d said Hartsfeld. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t shocked.\u201dA classmate, Cassidy McDermott Smith, was not so accustomed to mass killings: she hails from Australia, which banned assault weapons after the Port Arthur massacre of 1996.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me, nor should it to anyone,\u201d she said.Trump ignored vocal appeals for him to stay away, from sources including city officials. Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor, Bill Peduto, said Trump should postpone his visit at least until families of the dead could bury their loved ones. The first funerals for the 11 victims, among them a 97-year-old woman, were held on Tuesday. Several lawmakers from Washington were invited to join the president in Pittsburgh, and declined. Among them was Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, and other prominent lawmakers from the president\u2019s own party. The state\u2019s other senator, the Democrat Bob Casey, was not invited by the White House.Earlier this week, numerous members of the Jewish community in Pittsburgh voiced their opposition to Trump\u2019s visit.\u201cFor the past three years your words and your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,\u201d read a letter by local members of Bend the Arc, a national Jewish organization.\u201cYou yourself called the murderer evil, but yesterday\u2019s violence is the direct culmination of your influence.\u201d"}
