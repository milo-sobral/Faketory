If the three removed forces were included, the reductions were still 21%.The wide-ranging report also found:\u2022 While recorded crime has risen by nearly a third (32%) in three years, charges or summonses have fallen by 26% and the number of arrests is also down.\u2022 The proportion of fraud cases investigated is \u201cshockingly low\u201d in the context of 1.7m offences a year: \u201cIt appears highly unlikely that more than one in 200 victims ever sees their perpetrator convicted.\u201d\u2022 Internet child sexual abuse is reaching \u201cepidemic\u201d levels, with law enforcement estimates suggesting that 80,000 people may present some form of sexual threat to children online, the committee found. MPs also called for the private sector to do \u201cmuch more\u201d to reduce the demand on policing from the two types of crime.The report said police forces were struggling to cope in the face of changing and rising crimes as a result of falling staff numbers, outdated technology and a \u201ccomplete failure of leadership\u201d from the Home Office.Flagging up the role played by neighbourhood teams in tackling terrorism and gang crime, it said: \u201cIt is absolutely vital that this cornerstone of British policing is reaffirmed throughout the country, to ensure that trust and legitimacy is maintained.\u201cThis is particularly important in communities in which distrust of the police \u2013 and in public authorities more widely \u2013 is rife, and in which those local links are all the more important. Nevertheless, in all neighbourhoods, without local engagement, policing is at risk of becoming irrelevant to most people, particularly in the context of low rates of investigation for many crimes.\u201dThe chair of the committee, Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, said: \u201cCrime is up, charges and arrests are down, and the police service is struggling to respond effectively to emerging and growing challenges, such as online fraud and online child abuse. Policing urgently needs more money. The government must make sure policing is a priority in the budget and spending review, or public safety and communities will pay the price.\u201dStephen Doughty, a Labour member of the committee, said: \u201cNeighbourhood policing lies at the heart of British policing, and it has reached an unacceptable state \u2026 Once those crucial local relationships are lost, it is very difficult to rebuild them, and they are vital to so many areas of policing, from counter-terrorism to serious organised crime.\u201dTim Loughton, a Conservative member of the committee, said: \u201cWe found that the police are bringing a shockingly low number of charges for the possession of child abuse images, even though they are recording tens of thousands of offences. Whatever the cause, it is unacceptable that children are being put at risk by the collective failure to get a grip on this problem.\u201dDiane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cPolice cuts have consequences. You can\u2019t have safety and security on the cheap, but the government has been in total denial. The all-party committee is clear when it says there will be dire consequences for public safety, criminal justice and community cohesion if police funding is not increased.\u201dA Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThe home secretary has already been clear that he will prioritise funding for the police \u2026 The policing minister has spoken to leaders in every force in England and Wales to better understand the demand and changing nature of crime faced by forces.\u201cWe are now working closely with the police to gather the evidence to ensure they continue to receive the resources they need at the next spending review.\u201d"}
