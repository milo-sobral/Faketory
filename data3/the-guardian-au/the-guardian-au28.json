The bill is fatally flawed and we urge the House of Lords to ensure that the government rethinks the bill.\u201dThe joint statement said the \u201cvaguely defined\u201d crime of hostile state activity introduced by the bill will give border guards wide-ranging powers to stop, search and detain.The signatories said that a journalist taking a domestic flight could be stopped without any suspicion of wrongdoing and it would be an offence for the journalist not to answer questions or hand over materials, with no protection for confidential sources.Rebecca Vincent, the UK bureau director for Reporters Without Borders, said \u201cThis bill has extremely worrying implications for press freedom and the protection of journalistic sources.\u201cWe have underscored our concerns over a number of specific clauses that should be struck, or at a very minimum, amended to include clear exemptions for journalistic activities. We call on lords to carefully scrutinise this problematic bill and amend it to ensure that it does not contribute to further deterioration of UK press freedom.\u201dA Guardian News & Media spokesperson said: \u201cThe counter-terrorism bill poses a serious threat to press freedom, as it would potentially criminalise legitimate journalism and put at risk confidential sources and materials.\u201dElsewhere, the campaigners said that plans in the bill to criminalise expressing an opinion that is \u201csupportive\u201d of a banned group if the person does so in a way that is \u201creckless\u201d comes to close too \u201cmaking opinion a crime\u201d.They also flag that proposals to make it a crime to view online content that is likely to be useful for terrorism, even if you have no terrorist intent, would make the work of investigative journalists and academic researchers difficult or impossible.Other signatories backing the statement include the Committee on the Administration of Justice, Liberty, Article 19, the National Union of Students, Big Brother Watch, Rights Watch (UK) and Open Rights Group. The House of Lords will consider the bill at committee stage on 29 October.The home secretary, Sajid Javid, previously defended the proposed anti-terror laws in an article for the Guardian, insisting they were \u201cnot part of a sinister strategy to create an Orwellian state\u201d, adding: \u201cI totally reject any attempt to simplify today\u2019s debate into one of security versus liberty.\u201dOn Wednesday night, a Home Office spokesperson said:\u00a0\u201cIt is our view that the measures in the counter-terrorism and border security bill are necessary, proportionate and compatible with the European convention on human rights.\u201cAfter the spate of terrorist attacks of last year and the deadly nerve agent attack in Salisbury, our intelligence services and police made the case for an update of existing legislation and some new powers to help meet their operational needs and respond to the evolving threats posed by terrorism and hostile state activity.\u201d"}
