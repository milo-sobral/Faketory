However, it points out that educational attainment has improved across most groups, that the proportion of people holding degree-level qualifications has increased, that unemployment fell and the gender pay gap narrowed.It comes ahead of Monday\u2019s budget which campaigners for the worst-off groups hope will deliver some relief to the squeeze they have felt from austerity.Disabled people are more likely to be in poverty, face poorer health and a lack of access to suitable housing, the report found. There has also been a sharp increase in recorded disability hate crimes, and the likelihood of disabled people being in low-pay occupations has increased.It is a \u201cdisturbing assessment\u201d, according to Genevieve Edwards, director of external affairs at the Multiple Sclerosis Society.\u201cCuts to disability benefits and social care are pushing disabled people further into poverty,\u201d she said, adding that over 100,000 people live with MS in the UK and it can cost them an extra \u00a3200 a week to manage their condition. Across the UK nearly 14 million people are disabled.The number of people not in employment, education or training continued to fall but there remains a gulf in attainment depending on wealth. 40% of pupils who were eligible for free school meals achieved 9\u20134 grades in English and maths GCSEs in 2016/17, compared to 67% of non-eligible pupils.A child living in one of England\u2019s most disadvantaged areas is around six times more likely to go to a school rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d by Ofsted than a child in the least deprived. Exclusions are on the rise and bullying remains endemic with half of pupils suffering from it at some point.Gender bias remains strong among primary schoolchildren, with seven- to 11-year-old boys 20 times more likely than girls to aspire to be an engineer or architect. But more women are taking degrees than men and women get higher marks. The proportion of poor students is increasing too. White people are less likely to have a degree than people from ethnic minorities.Infant mortality is significantly higher in the most deprived areas (5.9 per 1,000 births as opposed to 3.8 on average). Black African and Pakistani families are most likely to experience the loss of an infant, with higher rates of obesity and diabetes contributing to the risk. David Isaac, chairman of the EHRC, said there had been \u201csignificant areas of progress, particularly in the improvement of opportunities in education and at work, as well as the fact that more people are now engaging in politics\u201d.But he added: \u201cAcross many areas in life, [people] struggle to make headway in a society where significant barriers still remain. They are the forgotten and the left behind and, unless we take action, it will be at least a generation before we put things right.\u201dA government spokesperson said the \u201cburning injustices\u201d would be tackled and that the UK has some of the strongest equalities legislation in the world.\u201cWe have introduced groundbreaking gender pay gap regulations, the race disparity audit which shines a light on how people of different ethnicities are treated across public services, the introduction of shared parental leave and \u00a3100m in funding committed between now and 2020 to strengthen support for victims.\u201d They added that total welfare spending was rising for disabled people and a million people had been lifted out of absolute poverty."}
