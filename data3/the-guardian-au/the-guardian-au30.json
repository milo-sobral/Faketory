{"id": "\nChris Evans's Radio 2 audience slumps in run-up to his move to Virgin\n", "paragraph": "Ratings for breakfast show of under 9 million a week will ease pressure on new host Zo\u00eb Ball\nJim Waterson Media editor\n\nThu 25 Oct 2018 00.01\u00a0BST\n\n\nLast modified on Thu 25 Oct 2018 00.40\u00a0BST\n\nChris Evans\u2019s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show has recorded its lowest listening figures in six years, dipping below 9 million listeners a week for the first time since 2012 as the presenter prepares for a big-money move to rival Virgin Radio.The fall in Evans\u2019s listening figures could prove to be a blessing in disguise by lowering expectations for incoming host Zo\u00eb Ball, who is set to go head to head with Evans in the competitive breakfast show slot.The show\u2019s decline came as new figures for the three months to 16 September showed the overall audience for almost all the BBC\u2019s national radio stations dipped during the period, as the corporation grapples with how to keep people listening to its traditional radio outlets as podcasts grow in popularity.The only national BBC outlets that bucked the trend and added listeners were the digital-only stations 6Music and BBC Radio 5 Live sports extra, according to official Rajar listening figures.The audience for Radio 4\u2019s Today programme\u2019s audience edged down slightly to below 7 million listeners, after suffering a significant fall in the quarter. However, Radio 1\u2019s breakfast show \u2013 which was taken over by new host Greg James halfway through the reporting period \u2013 added almost half a million listeners on a year-on-year basis.In the face of flatlining radio figures, the BBC is emphasising its investment in podcasts, which attracted a total of 26.5m downloads in the UK during September, aided by the likes of The Ratline, Friday Night Comedy and That Peter Crouch Podcast.The corporation insisted that it was happy with the overall performance of its stations given the hot weather, with 34 million people a week still tuning in to BBC radio, although many commercial stations posted healthy gains despite the summer heatwave.Absolute Radio, owned by Bauer Media, increased its audience by 8% year on year to 4.9 million listeners a week, while Magic FM rose by the same amount and Kiss also added listeners. Rival commercial radio group Global Radio saw slight gains for its Heart, Capital and Smooth stations. The company\u2019s output now reaches 25.2 million listeners a week.Earlier this year, the BBC\u2019s head of radio, James Purnell, said he was no longer interested in battling directly with commercial rivals for audience share and was more concerned about the threat posed by podcasting services and the likes of Netflix, with the broadcaster due to replace iPlayer Radio with its new BBC Sounds brand next week."}
