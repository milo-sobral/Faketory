Love Without Limits (BBC Two), the first episode of Louis Theroux\u2019s new documentary miniseries, Altered States, took him to Portland, Oregon, the epicentre of polyamory, or ethical non-monogamy, as it is now called. It is centred on the facility of \u201ccompersion\u201d \u2013 taking pleasure in seeing your significant other(s) happy in whatever way it takes. If you\u2019re exhausted already, I\u2019d advise you not to read on.Theroux gently interrogates three poly groups. Joelle, Mattias and AJ live and love together on an eco-homestead (I told you not to read on) and have other partners, too. Or in Joelle\u2019s case: \u201c\u2018Sweeties\u2019 ... I tend not to use hierarchical terms in my polydynamics.\u201d AJ is pregnant by Mattias and takes on another \u201cmetamor\u201d (another non-hierarchical term used by the poly community) during filming. Mattias is surprised to find this testing his compersion capacity.Then there are Bob, Nick and Amanda, who live as a \u201cthruple\u201d. The latter pair were college sweethearts, but when Amanda developed feelings for Bob, she proposed inviting him into their relationship rather than breaking up. Nick \u2013 after a year of discussion \u2013 agreed. He remains monogamous with Amanda. They used to have threesomes because \u201cwe thought we had to\u201d, but that didn\u2019t work because \u201cBob lasts a really long time in bed and I don\u2019t. So I\u2019d have to go first or I\u2019d fall asleep. Or go down and play video games or,\u201d he added with a grin, \u201chave lunch. But I\u2019m better at foreplay, I enjoy it more.\u201d Now they take it in turns. It seems to be working quite well. Not least, one suspects, for Amanda. \u201cIs there a part of you that wishes you were enough for Amanda in the same way as she is enough for you?\u201d Theroux asks the men in his patented tone of careful interest. \u201cA little part of me wishes I could make her completely happy,\u201d says Bob. At least one little part is working as hard as it can at that already.And then there is the married couple Heidi and Jerry; her lover, Joe; and his wife, Gretchen. To the casual observer, Heidi and Joe seemed to be stretching the definition of ethical non-monogamy. Gretchen said she was happy that Heidi was having the sex with Joe that she had lost all interest in having while they worked on other problems in their marriage. Jerry had a thousand-yard stare and a very soft voice while he insisted that everything was fine, after his period of \u201cadjustment\u201d when first an old friend of Heidi\u2019s and then Joe inserted themselves into his marriage. \u201cIt was hurtful,\u201d he remembers with a dreadful smile. \u201cAnd anxiety-producing.\u201d He has not yet found a partner. \u201cBut when I do it will be awesome.\u201dTheroux presses both women on Jerry\u2019s \u2013 self-evident, to Theroux and us \u2013 loneliness. Echoing other polys he has interviewed, they are both very clear. \u201cI am not responsible for Jerry\u2019s happiness,\u201d says Heidi. \u201cYou are responsible for your own happiness,\u201d says Gretchen. Jerry suggests he could join Heidi and Joe one night. Or at least watch. Heidi\u2019s face tells you all you need to know about who their setup is benefiting. She slams the lid down hard on the idea. Compersion is a one-way street, apparently.Theroux, as ever, treads his tightrope without a wobble (unless you count the unnecessary stunt of sending him to a borderline-orgy, even if it did provide a little light relief). He asks just enough and just hard-enough questions to challenge his interviewees and force them (and us) to think, without alienating them, and hangs back enough to let the answers\u2019 openness or person\u2019s defensiveness, body language, pauses and silences say at least as much again. By the end, the issue is complicated rather than simplified and your own questions fill your head as the credits roll.Is polyamory a new way of dealing with ancient problems or just a new way of trying to avoid them? Is infidelity immoral, or only when it produces the look Jerry has on his face between determined smiles? What if it always, always does, somewhere along the line? Are we hardwired to betray or feel betrayed, or are these only constructs? If we\u2019re not hardwired then why did we construct them in the first place? Is being responsible only for your own happiness a better basis on which to build a relationship or a society, or selfishness of the highest order that will sew the seeds of its own destruction? Are the polyamorous denying their essential humanity, indulging it or evolving beyond it?Answers on a postcard please. I am truly exhausted."}
