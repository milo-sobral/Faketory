Mount, who is hopeful of overcoming a foot injury, has scored five times and earned a call\u2011up to the England squad, while Tomori has established himself in Lampard\u2019s defence. Both played in the third-round elimination of Manchester United at Old Trafford.Maurizio Sarri\u2019s assistant first\u2011team coach, Gianfranco Zola, insisted Chelsea\u2019s special relationship with Lampard had not influenced the decision. \u201cMason and Tomori are growing up as players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that, by playing against us, it is an opportunity for them to grow up quicker. The more they play against Premier League teams, the more experience they get. And we can make better evaluations on them. It was a great opportunity to see them play in front of us, so we took it.\u201cCertainly there will be a lot at stake. From a technical, tactical and physical point of view, it will be a game on a higher level to the ones they play in their own league. But there will also be a psychological component. They will have to play in front of a big crowd, the crowd of the team they belong to. It will give them a good test.\u201d Zola confirmed the club would consider such arrangements with loanees on a match by match basis.Lampard, who scored a club record 211 goals in 648 Chelsea appearances, returns as a manager for the first time with Zola insistent the 40-year-old\u2019s achievements eclipse even his own at the club. \u201cLook at the results and the trophies that Frank achieved with Chelsea, there is no doubt he is the bigger legend,\u201d said the Italian, voted Chelsea\u2019s greatest ever player by supporters in 2003, with his final two years spent as Lampard\u2019s teammate. \u201cHe has achieved so much with this club.\u201cI know that, like many others, I was very important for the club because we started a process of getting better, becoming a well-established team in England and Europe. I know I have done very well like Dennis Wise, Roberto Di Matteo and many others. But Frank has really made a big mark, a big impression, like also John Terry. So he deserves the credit. It will be a big night for him, for sure.\u201d"}
