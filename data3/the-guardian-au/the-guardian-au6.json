For a political party like ours, it\u2019s also a liberating experience,\u201d Kok said of steering Labour toward the political centre.Current prime minister Mark Rutte praised Kok as someone who \u201cstood above political parties\u201d.Kok was \u201ctotally reliable, totally upright, and always focused on solutions\u201d, Rutte said in a statement.Internationally, Kok was strongly pro-European, helping to seal European economic and monetary union at the Amsterdam summit in 1997."}
