He was treated at Allegheny general hospital \u2013 during which he continued to shout antisemitic remarks, the hospital president said. Faced with a 44-count indictment that included charges of murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, Bowers pleaded not guilty. He faces the death penalty.The Washington Post reported that \u201cat least three\u201d of the doctors and nurses that saved the gunman\u2019s life were Jewish, a fact that attracted worldwide attention throughout a week of debate and mourning.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Ari Mahler wrote: \u201cSo now, here I am, the Jewish nurse that cared for Robert Bowers.\u201cI\u2019ve watched them talk about me on CNN, Fox News, Anderson Cooper, PBS and the local news stations. I\u2019ve read articles mentioning me in the [New York] Times and the Washington Post. The fact that I did my job, a job which requires compassion and empathy over everything, is newsworthy to people because I\u2019m Jewish. Even more so because my dad\u2019s a rabbi.\u201dWhy thank a Jewish nurse, when 15 minutes beforehand, you\u2019d shoot me in the head with no remorse?Media outlets including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said Allegheny Health Network representatives confirmed the authenticity of the post and Mahler\u2019s position as an emergency trauma room nurse.Mahler wrote extensively about his childhood and his experience of antisemitism in what he called \u201ca different time \u2026 where bullying was not monitored like it is now\u201d.\u201cThe fact that this shooting took place,\u201d he continued, \u201cdoesn\u2019t shock me. To be honest, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the next one happens \u2026 the FBI and the Southern Poverty Law Center note that Jews only account for 2% of the US population, yet 60% of all religious hate crimes are committed against them. I don\u2019t know why people hate us so much, but the underbelly of antisemitism seems to be thriving.\u201dBowers\u2019 social media use linked him to streams of far-right opinion in which antisemitism mixes with anti-immigrant invective. In the aftermath of the shooting, debate raged over the relevance or even culpability of Donald Trump\u2019s political rhetoric, including his equivocating response to far-right protesters who shouted antisemitic remarks in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. The president visited Squirrel Hill, meeting protest and considerable controversy.Mahler did not directly address such questions, writing in his post of the \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cempathy\u201d he tried to show the gunman.\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI didn\u2019t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers\u2019 eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.\u201dHe added, however, that he thought Bowers \u201cprobably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He\u2019s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use fear for motivation.\u201dMahler said he would not go into great detail, because of privacy rules. But he wrote that the gunman \u201cthanked me for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.\u201cI\u2019m sure he had no idea I was Jewish. Why thank a Jewish nurse, when 15 minutes beforehand, you\u2019d shoot me in the head with no remorse?\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word to him about my religion. Besides, if he finds out I\u2019m Jewish, does it really matter? The better question is, what does it mean to you?\u201dIn conclusion, Mahler wrote: \u201cIf my actions mean anything, love means everything.\u201d"}
