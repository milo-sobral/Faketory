{"id": "\n'He can kiss my red ass': California fire evacuees give Trump visit short shrift\nDonald Trump visits California, again blaming fires on forest management", "paragraph": "Hundreds displaced by wildfires who are gathered in a parking lot have more pressing concerns than the president\u2019s comments\nDani Anguiano in Chico, California\n\nSat 17 Nov 2018 22.06\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 17 Nov 2018 23.08\u00a0GMT\n\nAs Donald Trump landed in northern California on Saturday morning, hundreds of evacuees at a Walmart in Chico were frantically trying to figure out their next steps \u2013 which shelter they would go to, and if they should stay close to what\u2019s left of their homesin the fire-ravaged town of Paradise.At the giant box store, which has become a refugee camp for those forced to flee their homes when the worst blaze in state history incinerated their town, people ate lunch and packed their belongings and worried about the future.There was little talk of Trump, even though his motorcade was just miles away.The president flew by helicopter to the city of Chico to meet first responders and victims after Air Force One arrived at Beale air force base, about an hour\u2019s drive from the devastated town of Paradise.Trump was criticized for his initial response to the fire and threat to withhold funding, after he tweeted: \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201dWhen asked about the president\u2019s visit to the area, Kirk Ellsworth, whose adult children lost their homes in the fire, shook his head in disgust.\u201cMy kids lost everything. I voted for him \u2013 and now? He can kiss my red ass,\u201d Ellsworth said. \u201cWhat he said was ridiculous. It hurts my heart. A lot of us voted for him and he [talks] down to us?\u201dStill, the hope for many evacuees was that Trump\u2019s visit might draw attention to their plight and bring help for those who need it most. Nearly 10,000 homes were lost in the fire, which has killed 71, razed Paradise and caused severe damage to the smaller communities of Magalia and Stirling City.\u201cThe president of the United States to come here and meet the most vulnerable \u2013 that\u2019s important whether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican,\u201d Tammy Mezera said. \u201c[He] has a responsibility to do that.\u201dMezera hadn\u2019t given much thought to Trump\u2019s visit, she said. She\u2019s been \u201cfrantic\u201d trying to pack up the tent that has been her home since 8 November, when the Camp fire first erupted.Meanwhile, Ryan Belcher and his wife Casey have been doing the same, preparing to leave Walmart and find a new home for their two children. They hope Trump better understands the struggles of evacuees after seeing the devastation and shows more sympathy.\u201cWe are not the ones to blame. We are not in charge of managing the forest,\u201d Ryan said, frustrated, as he held two toys someone donated for his children.\u201cI hope he sees how this community has come together,\u201d he added, trailing off as someone asked if he and Casey were fire victims, and handed them gift cards.\u201dPeople are still here helping us. it\u2019s an amazing thing and I hope he sees that,\u201d Casey said, wiping away tears."}
