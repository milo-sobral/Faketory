Other pollutants produced by road traffic have also been linked to obesity in children by recent studies.Nitrogen dioxide pollution is at illegal levels in most urban areas in the UK and the government has lost three times in the high court over the inadequacy of its plans. The pollutant also plagues many cities in Europe and around the world.\u201cWe would urge parents to be mindful where their young children spend their time, especially considering if those areas are near major roads,\u201d said Jeniffer Kim, at the University of Southern California, who led the new research. \u201cThe first year of life is a period of rapid development of various systems in the body [and] may prime the body\u2019s future development.\u201dThe World Health Organization (WHO) revealed last Monday that 90% of the world\u2019s children are breathing unsafe air, a situation described as \u201cinexcusable\u201d by the WHO\u2019s head. Concern over the impact of toxic air on children\u2019s health is rising as research reveals serious long-term damage to both their physical and mental health.A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. Others linked air pollution with birth defects, cot deaths and the first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers\u2019 placentas has also been revealed.The new research, published in the journal Environmental Health, followed 2,318 children in southern California and built on earlier work which had identified traffic pollution as a major risk factor for the development of obesity in children.The research investigated the impact of air pollution from busy main roads, where diesel trucks are common, in the crucial first year of life. They found that by age 10, children suffering high early exposure were almost 1kg heavier on average than those with low exposure. The scientists took a series of other factors into account, including gender, ethnicity and parental education, and think it is unlikely that variations in diet could explain the strong link found.\u201cOur study suggests that early life may represent a critical window of exposure where increased [air pollution] may result in increased risk for higher childhood [weight] trajectories, which in turn may lead to childhood obesity,\u201d the researchers concluded.Other pollutants emitted by vehicles have also been linked to childhood obesity. A 2017 study in Boston implicated particulate pollution, while a 2012 study in New York City found the same for children exposed to polyaromatic hydrocarbons while in the womb.The new research was not able to examine how air pollution increases weight gain in the children, but Kim said inflammation was a possibility: \u201cThe most common thought is inflammation of body systems like the lungs which may spill over into the entire body \u2013 the brain which regulates appetite and changes in fat metabolism.\u201d\u201cThis study showing an association between increased body mass in children and exposure to air pollution from roads is important since it is compatible with previous studies showing an association between type 2 diabetes and air pollution in adults,\u201d said Prof Jonathan Grigg, at Queen Mary University London and not involved in the research.\u201cHowever, more research is needed to explain how toxins inhaled into the lungs affect fat cells throughout the body,\u201d he said. In mice experiments, brain inflammation caused by air pollution has been shown to result in anxiety-induced overeating.A separate new study on asthma, a disease long linked to air pollution and that is the most common chronic respiratory disease in the world, has estimated that between 9m and 33m emergency visits to hospital result from dirty air every year.The upper estimate represents almost a third of all emergency admissions suffered by the 358 million asthma sufferers in the world. \u201cThe findings estimate the magnitude of the global asthma burden that could be avoided by reducing [outdoor] air pollution,\u201d the scientists said."}
