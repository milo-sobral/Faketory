It suggests that poor transport infrastructure in the north could be to blame, with investment \u201cheavily skewed towards the south, especially London\u201d.Excessive speed, intoxication, failure to wear seatbelts, and unlicensed or uninsured driving are most prevalent in the most deprived areas in England. Pedestrians are also more likely to be killed in deprived areas, they claim.Experts analysed deaths and population data from the 10 government office regions and found work-related fatal accidents were also higher in the north of England, mainly owing to variations in regional industries and occupations and their associated risks.The fact that healthier people tend to migrate from north to south could also increase the north-south divide, research suggests.The north\u2013south divide in mortality for people aged 25\u201344 years first emerged during the mid-1990s and continued into 2016. This mortality divide grew quickly during that period for accidents among men relating to alcohol and drug misuse, while a longstanding gap for cardiovascular deaths remained and a gap for male suicide emerged more recently.London had the lowest mortality rates, with the north-east having the highest, even after adjusting for age, sex and socioeconomic deprivation.Suicide among men, especially at ages 30-34, is significantly more common in the north than the south.Professor Evan Kontopantelis, the lead author on the paper, said northern men may be more susceptible to societal pressure.\u201cWithout sounding too sexist, there is a bigger pressure for males in terms of getting a job and having a steady job and providing. That might be more relevant in the north, culturally,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who might feel left behind by society; there is immense pressure there. This is felt by both sexes but maybe it is more damaging for men.\u201dWomen in the north are more likely to die young from cancers caused by \u201crisky behaviours\u201d, particularly those related to smoking (lung and oropharynx), drinking (stomach and liver) and cervical cancer, which \u201cis largely determined by sexual behaviour risk factors, including age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, failure to use a condom during intercourse with multiple partners, and screening programme non-engagement\u201d.He said: \u201cSharp rises in deaths from accidents, suicide, alcohol misuse, smoking, cancer and drug addiction appear to have created new health divisions between England\u2019s regions and are profoundly concerning. These causes of death are all strongly associated with socioeconomic deprivation and in our models two-thirds of the excess mortality in the north was explained by that.Alcohol for example, underpins the steep and sustained increase in liver cirrhosis deaths in Britain from the 1990s, when the north-south divide in mortality for those aged 25-44 started to emerge.\u201dHe said the \u201cextreme\u201d concentration of power, wealth and opportunity in the capital were having a malign effect on the rest of the country.\u201cEngland\u2019s centralist tradition has blighted successive generations, and without major structural change will continue to damage public health,\u201d he said.More money should be spent on the north, particularly the NHS, he said, adding: \u201cThe north has been left behind and particularly for this generation of people seem to be much more affected by policies, by investment. There is a risk in an already fragmented society in terms of a divided England, that the north will become even more different from the south.\u201d"}
