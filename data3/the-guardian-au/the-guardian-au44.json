{"id": "\nAnger as Jesus reference removed from New Zealand parliamentary prayer\nNew Zealand earthquake: 6.2-magnitude shake halts parliament", "paragraph": "Christians descend on Wellington to protest decision of Labour speaker Trevor Mallard to omit the name \nEleanor Ainge Roy\n\nTue 30 Oct 2018 22.51\u00a0GMT\n\n\nLast modified on Wed 31 Oct 2018 13.52\u00a0GMT\n\nProtesters have descended on New Zealand\u2019s parliament this week to demand the speaker reinstate references to Jesus Christ in the parliamentary prayer.Since taking over the role in November last year, Labour\u2019s Trevor Mallard has dropped any reference to Jesus in the prayer which opens the start of every session.Mallard said he wanted to make the prayer more inclusive for all parliamentarians and the tweak was a \u201ccompromise\u201d.A reference to \u201calmighty god\u201d remains, but it is not a specific reference to a Christian god.On Tuesday around 1,000 people protested on the steps of parliament house in Wellington, arguing that New Zealand was a Christian nation and Mallard had no authority to axe Jesus\u2019s name.The protesters want Jesus\u2019s name reinstated, and held signs reading \u201cDishonourable Judas Mallard\u201d.\u201cHe needs a good kick in his pants, and he needs to actually be removed because this is a Christian nation,\u201d protester Rieki Teutscher told Radio NZ. \u201cWe don\u2019t share his atheism.\u201dAnother protester, Carmel Morgan, said Mallard should have consulted with New Zealanders or announced a referendum before changing the prayer.\u201cThis is a land of democracy, this is a land of freedom, you know, we want to be a first world country... he took that choice away from us.\u201dPoliticians such as Jacinda Ardern and Winston Peters have said it would have been judicious for the speaker to have consulted more widely before actioning the changes.\u201cWell the decision as to what should be changed should be made by parliamentarians and not the speaker \u2013 that\u2019s our position, I don\u2019t mind telling you publicly,\u201d deputy prime minister Winston Peters told RNZ.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a change let\u2019s have parliament decide \u2013 not one person.\u201dMallard said he had consulted with parliamentarians and the majority had indicated they were in favour of a secular prayer.Since being unanimously elected as speaker Mallard has made headlines for a slew of progressive tweaks to parliament in a bid to make it a more inclusive and family-friendly environment, as well as making it more welcoming to every day New Zealanders.The times they are a changing.
