The point needed to be made.\u201dThe former Daily Mail editor was making the lecture at the Society of Editors conference in Salford, where he was awarded the society\u2019s first lifetime achievement award.Dacre used a lengthy part of his valedictory speech to criticise the \u201cliberal Brexit-hating media\u201d who \u201calmost always regard with contempt the mass-selling papers which have to appeal to large audiences to survive commercially\u201d.Among other predictions, he said the UK would soon the see the rise of rightwing TV broadcasters to fill the gap left by the BBC, that Theresa May would lead the Conservatives into the next general election, that tech companies that provide \u201csuccour to terrorists and paedophiles\u201d would soon be broken up, and that print newspapers would be here to stay for some time.Dacre said there was an ever-growing gap between London-based journalists and the views of the general public. He said: \u201cThey aren\u2019t obsessing over #MeToo, or transgender rights, or equal pay for BBC journalists. And they do like Mrs May and think she\u2019s doing a job in difficult circumstances.\u201dHe saved particular anger for the Guardian, spending 15 minutes of the speech criticising the organisation and its views. However, he later accepted that it was \u201cstill a great and important paper\u201d and part of the tradition of a British free press, which ensures rival papers are allowed to make contradictory editorial calls, such as over the Edward Snowden leaks \u2013 which Dacre strongly opposed.Dacre said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the Guardian\u2019s decision to publish Snowden, who now skulks in the murderous kleptocracy that is Russia. The man was a traitor who should have been arrested and not sanctified. But I also passionately believe the Guardian must have the freedom to carry such stories.\u201dHe criticised \u201cleftwing\u201d professors of journalism and said it was a ludicrous topic for academic study, with journalism degree programmes \u201cchurning out graduates for non-existent jobs\u201d.Ian MacGregor, the Telegraph\u2019s editor emeritus and president of the Society of Editors, said Dacre \u201chas been, without doubt, one of the most successful and influential newspaper editors of his generation\u201d.\u201cThe British media would be in an awful lot weaker position without him and his enormous contribution,\u201d said MacGregor, presenting him with a cut-glass bowl.Dacre, who ended a 26-year stint as editor of the Daily Mail this summer, made no mention in the speech of his successor, Geordie Greig.Before leaving the editor\u2019s chair, Dacre gave repeated public warnings to Greig about the risk of moving the Daily Mail\u2019s editorial line away from a hard Brexit, advice that Greig has happily ignored \u2013 instead turning his newspaper\u2019s anger on the likes of Iain Duncan Smith for attempting to disrupt Theresa May\u2019s negotiations with the EU.Despite speculation that Dacre would continue to exert power over the paper, Greig has made it repeatedly clear that he answers directly to the Daily Mail owner, Viscount Rothermere. The new editor was not in Manchester to hear the advice from his predecessor.Dacre, who turns 70 next week, is understood to have signed with a literary agency and is working on his autobiography. Asked about this, he said: \u201cEvery editor thinks about writing his memoirs.\u201d"}
