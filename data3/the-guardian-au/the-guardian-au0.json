Schools will get a share of a \u00a3320m fund to help boost swimming lessons, he said.While the Department for Education has not proposed any new measures to compel private schools to open their pools, Hinds said he was personally determined to \u201cmake sure our children grow up safe and water confident\u201d. \u201cMany independent schools are already doing this, but others can and must do more to help every child in their community,\u201d he said.The issue is likely to reopen the debate on whether private schools\u2019 ability to claim charitable status should be predicated on their willingness to share their sports facilities with state school pupils.This year\u2019s figures from the Independent Schools Council, which represents 1,326 private schools in the UK, show that of 603 of its member schools that have pools, 304 already share them in some way with state school pupils.Meanwhile, 72% of primary schools use public pools for swimming lessons, while 15% use their own pool and 10% use another private facility.In 2015, Lord Moynihan, the outgoing Conservative chairman of the British Olympic Association, moved an amendment to the Charities Bill to require private schools that have charitable status to share their sports facilities. It was defeated 156 to 105.Headteachers who have opened up their facilities tell us it's a win-win for the schools and the communityThe Charity Commission updated its guidance in 2015 to encourage independent schools to report how they are opening up access to their sports and arts facilities, but stopped short of requiring that they do so to keep their charitable status.Julie Robinson, general secretary of the ISC, said that there was \u201cmuch goodwill from schools fortunate to have facilities that may be in short supply locally\u201d. She added that \u201craising awareness of partnerships helps more state schools and independent schools develop mutually beneficial programmes\u201d.\u201cHeadteachers who have opened up their facilities tell us it\u2019s a win-win for the schools and the community,\u201d said Charles Johnston, director of property for Sport England, a public body under the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. \u201cIt allows facilities to be used at times when otherwise they\u2019d be empty.\u201dBut Ali Oliver, chief executive for the Youth Sport Trust, said that \u201cmuch more needs to be done to remove barriers to sport and play and ensure that people are not deprived of opportunities based on their gender, ability, background or where they live. It is vital that programmes to raise levels of activity are targeted at those most in need.\u201dTom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, who is responsible for sport, said: \u201cThis barely moves the dial on the pressing need to improve the health of our children, when six out of 10 are leaving primary school either overweight or obese.\u201cIf you really want to improve children\u2019s health, make guidelines on nutrition in schools mandatory, not voluntary.\u201d"}
