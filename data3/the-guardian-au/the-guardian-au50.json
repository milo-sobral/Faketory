Norwich more than matched the hosts and looked like they might cause an upset when Onel Hern\u00e1ndez cancelled out Junior Stanislas\u2019s first-half opener.Victory for the Cherries, who are sixth in the Premier League, maintains their unbeaten home record and puts them in the last eight of the tournament for the second successive season.Eddie Howe\u2019s much-changed side were almost ahead inside five minutes when Jermain Defoe lashed inches wide of the right post following Marc Pugh\u2019s pullback.In-form Norwich, who also made eight changes for the tie, had the better of the first-half play and edged possession. The Canaries \u2013 fourth in the second tier following eight wins from 10 in all competitions \u2013 threatened an opener when Felix Passlack flashed an attempt across goal following Mario Vrancic\u2019s superb crossfield pass.But Stanislas put the hosts in front six minutes before the break. Having received the ball wide on the left from Defoe, the forward advanced into the box, bamboozled Alex Tettey with a couple of stepovers and smashed his third goal of the campaign into the roof of Michael McGovern\u2019s net.Daniel Farke, celebrating his 42nd birthday, would have been pleased with Norwich\u2019s response to the setback. Dennis Srbeny immediately broke clear on goal from a Vrancic pass and saw his attempt blocked by the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Artur Boruc.The midfielder Vrancic then shot agonisingly wide after tricking his way past Dan Gosling while German forward Srbeny \u2013 who scored twice in the earlier rounds of the competition \u2013 rattled the inside of the right post.Norwich continued to cause their hosts problems after the break and levelled with 20 minutes remaining. Tom Trybull lifted the ball over the Bournemouth backline and Hern\u00e1ndez, who had earlier tested Boruc with a low shot at the near post, bobbled a finish into the bottom-left corner.Parity lasted all of two minutes though as Bournemouth sealed their place in Wednesday evening\u2019s quarter-final draw. City failed to clear a corner and, after Pugh\u2019s initial effort was blocked, Cook blasted through a crowded penalty area to the relief of the home fans.The visitors were given seven minutes of added time to take the match to penalties but the substitute Jordan Rhodes headed wide from an excellent late opportunity."}
