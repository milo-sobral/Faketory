It's a disaster | Katharine MurphyAFP raids home affairs department over Peter Dutton au pair visa leaks", "paragraph": "Officially declared Wentworth byelection winner, MP wants to stop Adani and will seek urgent briefing on minister\nPaul Karp and \nAnne Davies\n\nSun 4 Nov 2018 23.07\u00a0GMT\n\n\nFirst published on Sun 4 Nov 2018 22.57\u00a0GMT\n\nThe newly minted independent MP for Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, has pledged to tackle climate change policy as her first priority after she was formally declared the winner of the once blue ribbon Liberal seat in Sydney\u2019s east.Phelps said she would move to reinstate the Climate Change Authority to provide a scientific voice in the debate, put forward reforms to vehicle emissions standards and look at ways to use the crossbench clout to stop the Adani coalmine.\u201cWe can stop fiddling around with talking about new coalmines because no one wants to fund them,\u201d she said.\u201cGovernment policy needs to establish a foundation for business to invest in renewables for our future and to protect our environment. That is something the Australian people are saying they want.\u201dPhelps also said she will seek an urgent briefing on the constitutional eligibility of Liberal MPs Peter Dutton and Chris Crewther, adding that she had received legal advice that she did not have any section 44 issues that might affect her own eligibility to sit.As a doctor, Phelps is part of the Medicare system, but she said rebates were paid not to her but to her patients. She also said there was no issue as a result of her being a city of Sydney councillor.The Australian Electoral Commission on Monday declared Phelps the winner with a margin of 1,851 votes or 1.2% in two-party-preferred terms after a record 19% swing against the Coalition.Although Phelps has hosed down the suggestion she could vote for a no-confidence motion by declaring she has \u201cno intention of being a wrecker\u201d, her entry to parliament spells trouble for the Morrison government, which has now lost its majority.Phelps said a no-confidence motion was currently a hypothetical but if one arose she would consider all the evidence before deciding her position.\u201cOne of the things I will bring to the parliament is the ability to make a careful diagnosis and to have a plan, after looking at all the evidence to hand,\u201d she said.Scott Morrison will seek to shore up the government\u2019s position with a bus tour of Queensland, in a bid to visit key marginals before the 2019 federal election.On Monday Phelps said her election was propelled by \u201cdisenchantment with the party political system\u201d after the ouster of Malcolm Turnbull from the Liberal leadership, and discontent over the lack of action on climate change and treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.Common ground between the crossbench and opposition on establishing a federal anti-corruption commission and ending live sheep exports exposes the government on the floor of the lower house.Dutton, the home affairs minister, and Crewther also face the possibility of a hostile referral to the high court to determine if their business interests constitute an indirect pecuniary interest in an agreement with the commonwealth, which would disqualify them from parliament.Labor has indicated it will push to refer Crewther. It was revealed on Friday he invested $25,000 in Gretals Australia, a biotechnology company that has received commonwealth grants and funding.Morrison has said he has \u201cno concerns\u201d about the investment, which was declared on the parliamentary register of interests.Asked how she would approach referrals to the high court, Phelps told Radio National that \u201cevidence is the most important thing\u201d in deciding whether to ask the court to rule on an MP\u2019s eligibility under section 44 of the constitution.\u201cI would have to get a comprehensive briefing on those two cases and will make a decision based on that briefing,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be seeking that as soon as I possibly can \u2026 I will be asking for information to make an informed decision.\u201dDutton has had a question mark over his eligibility since August, when it was revealed he is a beneficiary of a trust that operates childcare centres that receive federal subsidies. The solicitor general has advised he is \u201cnot incapable\u201d of sitting as a member of parliament but there is still \u201csome risk\u201d the high court might find he has a conflict of interest.Facing questions over her own eligibility, Phelps said she had received \u201chigh-level legal advice\u201d before she nominated to check that her occupation as a GP and a city of Sydney councillor would not disqualify her.Phelps said she had done so because section 44 had been \u201cused politically\u201d and it was a matter of due diligence not to nominate unless she was satisfied she was eligible.\u201cI am satisfied that I don\u2019t have any issues there \u2013 bearing in mind that the Medicare rebate is the patient\u2019s statutory benefit, it is not a payment to the doctor,\u201d she said.Phelps explained she had decided to stay on the city of Sydney council for now because she \u201chas a duty to the ratepayers not to have a byelection unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary\u201d. Staying until April 2019 would help avoid an \u201cexpensive byelection\u201d, she said, at which point she would reassess her decision.Phelps said she had not yet spoken to the prime minister.While not ruling out support for a no-confidence motion, Phelps said the electors of Wentworth had voted for \u201cmore stability not less\u201d and wanted politics to return to the \u201csensible centre\u201d.Morrison\u2019s four-day trip will take him from the Gold Coast to Townsville, visiting marginal seats and spruiking the Coalition\u2019s tax and infrastructure policies.Looking forward to hitting the road in Qld this week and keeping Australia on the right track - lower taxes, more jobs, lower electricity prices, economy building and congestion busting infrastructure, AAA balanced budgets. pic.twitter.com/TnRFVZFjbjOn Sunday Morrison announced $200m to improve water supply to Townsville, including funding for a second pipeline to the Burdekin River."}
