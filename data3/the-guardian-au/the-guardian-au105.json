Tin Jedvaj, the Bayer Leverkusen defender whose stoppage-time winner defeated Spain on Thursday, suggested England had been beaten \u201cwithout any problems\u201d in Moscow and the visitors at Wembley should be considered \u201cfavourites, despite the fact we are playing away\u201d.Those comments have been noted by England, who had created the better chances in a 0-0 draw behind closed doors in Rijeka last month, as they prepared for a game that could see either team claim the group and a place at the finals in June, but will definitely result in one of the sides being relegated to League B.\u201cWhenever people speak, you give the opposition the opportunity to use those words as they see fit,\u201d said Southgate, whose side must win to progress, with defeat or a score draw meaning demotion. \u201cThere were some comments from Sweden in the summer that we definitely used to our advantage. And you can steer that in any way, because half the players thought it was a current Sweden player and it wasn\u2019t [Hakan Mild, a midfielder who played for Sweden in the 1990s, had spoken publicly before the quarter-final between the teams]. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with them.\u201cYou always have to be conscious of how your words can provide motivation to the opposition. But for Croatia, it\u2019s about how our mindset is for the game. We\u2019ve got to play bloody well. They\u2019re a good team and, with and without the ball, we\u2019ve got to be spot-on to beat them. There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s been huge positive strides this year. But for us, as a group of players and staff, we want to finish with a win that would take us to another semi-final.\u201cWe want to be involved in those games that matter all the time, and if we\u2019re knocking on the door and picking up those experiences, that\u2019s how you progress as a team. That\u2019s how you learn to win these important matches. It would be the icing on the cake if we could win this game and take another forward step as a team.\u201dSouthgate\u2019s selection for Thursday\u2019s comfortable friendly victory over the United States had always been with Sunday\u2019s critical tie in mind, and he will welcome back senior figures such as Harry Kane, John Stones, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Marcus Rashford into his lineup. Joe Gomez, who has trained fully the last two days, will be restored to central defence, while Ross Barkley is preferred to Dele Alli alongside Henderson and Eric Dier in the midfield three. Only Jordan Pickford is expected to start a second game in succession.Southgate is insistent lessons have been learned from previous encounters, most obviously from the defeat in the Luzhniki Stadium in July. \u201cWe\u2019d had just a couple of days to prepare for that game and months to watch it back since,\u201d he added. \u201cWe haven\u2019t beaten top teams, historically. That\u2019s not perception, that\u2019s the truth. It just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201cWinning this match wouldn\u2019t change that for good, but what has been exciting is that we looked at the summer and what we achieved and asked: \u2018What do we do to progress that forward?\u2019 If you look at the five games we have played since, some of the performances have been very good, some of the results have been good, with wins against top 10 nations, and there\u2019s been the emergence of more young players that has given us greater depth to the squad. This period is one where there has been improvement and progress.\u201dKane is seeking a first England goal since the World Cup knockout win over Colombia after a seven-game scoreless streak, his longest at this level. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re a better team now than we were in the summer,\u201d the captain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learnt from those experiences and a lot from beating Spain in October, a victory I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life. We said after the summer the most important thing was not to fall off and go to the Euros without any momentum. We have done well in this Nations League. There\u2019d be no better way to finish the year than by winning and getting into these semi-finals.\u201d"}
