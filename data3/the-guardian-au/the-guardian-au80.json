The free reading time will be based on what the company described as a \u201cdynamic meter\u201d, rather than a set number of articles.Wasserstein told the New York Times the move to a paywall had been planned for more than a year. A press release said the magazine has a global audience of 45 million readers per month.\u201cWith this new subscription offering, we\u2019re hoping to introduce more readers to the breadth of our coverage that has the same sensibility and journalistic quality,\u201d said Adam Moss, New York magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief."}
