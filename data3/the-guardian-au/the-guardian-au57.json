Police say the boy was related to Schultz but it\u2019s unclear whether he saw the shooting.An hour later and 125km away, NSW police were called to a second shooting at Rufus, near Lake Victoria on the northern bank of the river, where the body of the 63-year-old man, reported to be Ray Cohrs, was discovered, along with a 55-year-old man who was uninjured but held against his will.The alleged shooter was discovered nearby, critically injured with what appeared to be self-inflicted gunshot wounds.Detectives on both sides of the border are investigating the incident and so far no charges have been laid.Fairfax Media has reported that the victims were Paul Cohrs\u2019s mother and brother, but police would not confirm the relationship except to say that \u201call parties are believed to be known to each other\u201d.In a statement, NSW police said it was a \u201csuspected domestic violence-related shooting\u201d.It is the sixth suspected domestic violence killing involving the death of a woman this month, according to the Counting Dead Women project by Destroy The Joint.Police have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection to the shooting but have asked anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636.
