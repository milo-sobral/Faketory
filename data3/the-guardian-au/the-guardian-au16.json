Then the price of beer went up\nBen Smee\n\nSat 20 Oct 2018 20.00\u00a0BST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 20 Oct 2018 20.01\u00a0BST\n\nOne night in 1964 an Aboriginal man was dragged from his bed in the Bagot community, a settlement in suburban Darwin, and charged with the offence of drinking liquor.A report in the Northern Territory News, published the following day, said a \u201cnative\u201d was sentenced to 14 days\u2019 jail. Next to the article was a half-page advertisement showing a white man drinking a \u201cbeer that\u2019s really beer\u201d.This is how it\u2019s always been in the Territory \u2013 a \u201cdualistic framing\u201d \u2013 according to Peter d\u2019Abbs, the professor of substance misuse studies at the Menzies School of Health Research.\u201cAboriginal drinking is [viewed as] a problem, to be policed,\u201d d\u2019Abbs said. \u201cDrinking by non-Aboriginal people is ... a \u2018core social value\u2019 and part of the \u2018unique Territory lifestyle\u2019.\u201dThe Territory has the highest per-capita rate of alcohol consumption in Australia, one of the highest in the world, and the highest rate of hospitalisations due to alcohol misuse. The statistics are worrying for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.Attempts to \u201cdam the rivers of grog\u201d have rarely been backed by effective resources or evidence, and almost all disproportionately targeted Indigenous people \u2013 until now.This month, the Northern Territory\u2019s Labor government brought into effect a new policy, a \u201cfloor price\u201d for alcohol; recommended by an inquiry and strongly backed by health researchers, academics, social organisations and a body of evidence that shows it has a tangible benefit in other countries.The measure, which sets a minimum price of $1.30 for a standard drink of alcohol, was passed into law with cross-party support and minimal outrage.Then the price of beer went up in Darwin.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t handled well,\u201d an NT Labor source told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe won\u2019t drop the policy, and I don\u2019t think we should. But we are in a muddle over it.\u201cThe [Northern Territory News] has just hammered us. No one thought it would be possible to lose government in 2020 but now I think we\u2019re at the point where we will be running a sort of defensive campaign where we\u2019re portrayed as the nanny state.\u201dLabor won power in the Territory in 2016 with 59% of the two-party preferred vote. The government holds 18 of 25 seats in the legislative assembly. The opposition Country Liberal party has just two.The CLP was hounded from office after a four-year term that included two chief ministers, eight deputy leaders and 16 cabinet reshuffles, on top of a list of defections, sex scandals and stuff-ups. The new chief minister, Michael Gunner, promised stable government.In his government\u2019s first two years, there have been no major political scandals, no leadership tensions, no cabinet sackings. That stability has, some sources say, irritated ambitious backbenchers forced to wait longer than expected for a promotion.Polling leaked to the ABC last month showed Labor leading the CLP 53-47 \u2013 a result that close would deliver a hung parliament. And now the mood of voters has turned darker.Gunner said earlier this year he wanted to \u201ctear up the liquor act\u201d and start again, amid reports of rampant anti-social behaviour caused by alcohol. The former supreme court chief justice Trevor Riley held an inquiry and came back with a suite of recommendations, including the floor price. The government set the floor price at $1.30 per unit of alcohol, deliberately set just below the current the price of non-premium Australian beer.The government gave assurances the measure would not affect the price of beer and it passed the parliament with little fanfare, and with strong bipartisan backing.Within days of the new laws coming into effect, bottle shops in Darwin reportedly increased prices for cartons of beer by up to 20%. Soon after, the CLP withdrew its support.The party\u2019s leader, Gary Higgins, said that decision was made after \u201coverwhelming feedback from Territorians sent a clear message to the opposition. We listened and pulled our support accordingly.\u201dHiggins said the government had misled people about the impact of the policy. He said the government would also not commit to an independent evaluation of the floor price until after the 2020 election.\u201cThe implementation of this policy has been a complete failure by Labor, primarily caused by its lack of honesty with Territorians on the effect of the floor price.\u201cThe alcohol floor price completely fails to address the levels of chronic alcoholism in the Territory, and its effects on responsible drinkers.\u201dThe floor price effectively mandated price increases to the cheapest of cheap grog: cleanskin bottles of wine, cask wine and port. A study of drinking patterns among Darwin\u2019s homeless found a preference for beer, but that port was consumed in the greatest quantity, because it was cheaper.Retailers went public last week and claim they\u2019re now unable to offer popular bulk specials on beer. NT Consumer Affairs warned the cost of beer and other drinks may be increasing \u201cwell beyond the floor price legislation\u201d and voted to investigate retailers who blamed hikes on the new laws.Wine retailers have pulled their products from the Territory. One online retailer, Naked Wines, said it had increased costs.The winemakers\u2019 federation of Australia even suggested the floor price was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d but agreed to support the government in an attempt to evaluate whether the measure was effective.\u201cWe would hate to see other states bringing in a measure that is not only illegal but doesn\u2019t work,\u201d the federation\u2019s chief executive, Tony Bataglene, said.Backlash has been stirred and sustained by local media. The Northern Territory News dedicated five front pages to the politics of the floor price in recent weeks. Talkback callers have been angry. Anti-government sentiment has amped up on social media. An NT News poll showed 80% of people were opposed to the floor price.The health minister, Natasha Fyles, admits the government \u201cmight have been simplistic\u201d in its explanation of how the floor price would operate.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give consumers the tools so they understand how it works,\u201d she said. \u201cIt only affects 25 to 30 products and some specials, there\u2019s only a very small number of products it impacts on, but the evidence shows it works.\u201dFyles said retailers \u201ccan price their products wherever they want\u201d but that those decisions were commercial, not related to the floor price. She said the government would continually monitor the program and that a formal review would be conducted in three years, as recommended by the Riley inquiry.\u201cThis is just one measure of 219 that we\u2019re putting in place,\u201d Fyles said. \u201cGrog and the harm it causes has always been an issue in our community. As a responsible government we need to put this measure in place and give it time.\u201dThe floor price is backed by the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, the Foundation of Alcohol Research and Education, the Public Health Association and the National Alliance for Action on Alcohol.A coalition of health, justice and social services organisations in the Territory released a statement last week to back the plan, amid growing criticism.\u201cIt is disappointing to see politicians step away from a strong evidence base under the influence of popular opinion,\u201d the groups said.John Boffa, a doctor who speaks for the People\u2019s Alcohol Action Coalition, has been campaigning for similar measures in central Australia since the late 1980s. He said that a week after the floor price was introduced, combined with a more permanent presence of police outside bottle shops, emergency department presentations at the Alice Springs hospital dropped from 150 a day to 95.\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that to reduce consumption and harm, you\u2019ve got to address price,\u201d he said. \u201cThe floor price doesn\u2019t make us a nanny state. The state is trying to meet its obligation to keep its citizens free from preventable illness, injury, violence and neglect.\u201dBoffa rattles off figures \u2013 every week in the NT there are two deaths, 52 hospitalisations and 69 assaults due to excessive drinking. Territory drivers are 20 times more likely to be caught drink-driving. The road death toll is four times the national average. Alcohol is a factor in 53% of assaults and 65% of reported family violence.He says Territorians, \u201cAboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike\u201d, have a problem with alcohol.\u201c43% of Territorians drink at risky levels, yet Aboriginal people make up just a third of the population. The alcohol-related death rate for non-Aboriginal Territorians is twice the national average and the assault rate amongst non-Aboriginal men, largely alcohol-related, is nearly as high.\u201cThe backlash is because this is affecting people who wrongly think they\u2019re responsible drinkers. We think it\u2019s going to make a huge difference.\u201dD\u2019Abbs said the Territory had, prior to 2016, taken a \u201cgrandstanding\u201d approach to liquor policy.\u201cWe had a pretty unseemly sequence of governments rejecting the notion that alcohol was some sort of community-wide problem and using the language of the \u2018problem drinker\u2019,\u201d d\u2019Abbs said.\u201cFor most of that period [since self-government was granted in 1978], most of the measures ... rested on the assumption that alcohol problems equal Aboriginal problems and that the plainly obvious culture of heavy drinking in the Territory among non-Aboriginal people is something to be overlooked or celebrated.\u201cPopulation-based policies around drinking are very difficult to sell because of this notion that drinking is some sort of inalienable right\u201d."}
