Riyadh said the journalist was killed in a \u201cfist fight\u201d as part of a rendition attempt gone wrong, after denying for weeks that he had come to any harm in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Florida senator Marco Rubio called the Saudi account of the journalist\u2019s death \u201cbizarre\u201d and slammed authorities in Riydah for their lack of transparency. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s changing stories on Khashoggi\u2019s murder is getting old,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Along with other senior US politicians, Rubio said he would insist on a full investigation by US intelligence, and called for those responsible to face sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, legislation named after a murdered Russian lawyer which punishes Russian human rights offenders.Saudi Arabia released its account of Khashoggi\u2019s death on the state news agency. It claimed the 59-year-old had got into a fight with 15 officials sent to bring him back to Saudi Arabia by force, including several members of the security forces.His body was disposed of by a \u201clocal collaborator\u201d, officials later added. That claim allowed Saudi officials to disassociate themselves from the search for remains, which could potentially contradict their account.Turkish authorities have presented an entirely different version of Khashoggi\u2019s last moments. In details slowly leaked to international and national press, investigators alleged the journalist was tortured and murdered and his body dismembered with a bone saw.They have provided details of 15 men who arrived in Istanbul from Riyadh on private jets owned by the Saudi royal family on the day of Khashoggi\u2019s death, who included members of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s security staff and a well-known forensics expert.The Republican chair of the powerful Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Corker, also questioned the Saudi account.\u201cThe story the Saudis have told about Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance continues to change with each passing day, so we should not assume their latest story holds water,\u201d he said.\u201cThe US administration must make its own independent, credible determination of responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder under the Global Magnitsky investigation.\u201dUnder the law, the administration has 120 days from the day the Senate invoked Global Magnitsky, 10 October, to present the results of an investigation and a decision on sanctions.Khashoggi was a Saudi national but a US permanent resident, and wrote a regular column for the Washington Post. Saudi Arabia had been under significant pressure from the White House to offer an explanation in the escalating diplomatic crisis.Its eventual account appeared designed to protect the crown prince \u2013 the country\u2019s de facto ruler \u2013 by painting a picture of failure in an operation run without his direct knowledge.The statements said 18 men had been arrested in connection with the \u201ccover-up\u201d and two senior officials, who were also close confidantes of the crown prince, had been sacked.Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies in the region expressed support for the explanation. Trump described it as \u201ccredible\u201d and the UK, another ally, cautiously acknowledged the Saudi version of events.A statement from the Foreign Office said the government was considering its next steps.But it was not clear the explanation, the sackings and claimed arrests would contain the damage to Riyadh. Its account raises serious questions, and the abrupt admission of murder after two weeks insisting Khashoggi had left the consulate alive have shredded Riyadh\u2019s credibility.The UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d, a spokesman said. He called for \u201ca prompt, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Khashoggi\u2018s death and full accountability for those responsible\u201d.The human rights group Amnesty International questioned the Saudi account and the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Joel Simon, derided Riyadh\u2019s account as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Both called for an impartial international investigation.Friends and colleagues of Khashoggi added a personal note to calls for justice when they resumed a vigil outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was killed, mourning his death and demanding \u201ctrue justice\u201d for those responsible.However Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump, signalled continued Trump family support, insisting in an interview on Fox News that US-Saudi relations were too commercially and strategically important to allow the murder of a journalist to affect them.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take [that relationship] and you\u2019re going to throw all of that away?\u201d"}
