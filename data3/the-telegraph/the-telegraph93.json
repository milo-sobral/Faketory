{"id": "\nCheltenham BetVictor Gold Cup: Nicky Henderson's Rather Be installed as 5-1 favourite\n", "paragraph": "Nicky Henderson\u2019s Rather Be has been installed as 5-1 favourite with the sponsor for the BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday.The handicap chase, which is worth \u00a390,000 to the winner, looks like it could be a repeat of the Close Brothers Novices\u2019 Handicap Chase last March when Rather Be was beaten a head by the Mick Channon-trained Mister Whitaker, a recent Carlisle winner.There is a 9lb swing in the weights in Rather Be\u2019s favour now and a Nicky Henderson treble at Kempton on Monday\u00a0will hardly dampen punter confidence, but Jack Channon, assistant to his father, was hopeful Mister Whitaker could still emerge victorious.\u201cSome people with hindsight will say, \u2018Why did you run at Carlisle as you\u2019ve now gone up 7lb?\u2019 But he is a horse who can run quite fresh first time out and you can\u2019t afford any rustiness in any of these 20-runner handicaps. If he is to become a real top horse he should be able to defy his rise in the weights.\u201dOther highlights at the course\u2019s three-day November meeting, which traditionally heralds the start of the jump season proper, include the appearance of last year\u2019s Grand National winner Tiger Roll in the Glenfarclas Cross-Country on Friday and Coneygree, the 2015 Gold Cup winner, in the BetVictor Handicap Chase on Saturday.At Kempton yesterday, Bryony Frost rode out her 3lb claim when Marienstar became her 75th winner.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
