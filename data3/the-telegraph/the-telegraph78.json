I was yelling, 'Help, help.'\"Italian news reports said the dead included a one-year-old, a three-year-old and a teenager.The tragedy brings the number of people killed in Sicily this weekend to at least 12 after three other people died in their cars when hit by torrents of water.Mr Conte spoke of \"an immense tragedy\" during a visit on Sunday to affected areas in Sicily.He said a cabinet meeting would be convened this week to declare a state of emergency and come up with the first package of aid for areas affected.Heavy rains and gale-force winds have battered Italy for several days, uprooting millions of trees and cutting off villages and roads.Italy's Civil Protection Agency said deaths caused by the wave of bad weather stood at 17, excluding the fatalities in Sicily.Some of the worst damage has been recorded in the northern regions of Trentino and Veneto.Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto, has estimated the damage will cost \u20ac1 billion (\u00a3874 million) to repair.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
