But there are clearly huge problems with young people like me being exposed to things on the internet we simply don\u2019t wish to see.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some really welcome changes over the past few months with the Government committing to tackling these issues. But when children as young as 13 can legally sign up for an account, we need all social media sites to ensure young people feel safe to both enjoy social media and to report content that is inappropriate. At the very least, we believe there should be minimum safety standards set out by the Government which all social media platforms should meet.\u201cAt Girlguiding, we believe girls should have a voice to express their concerns about the world they live in, something that is more important than ever given the huge number of women and girls who have come forward about abuse, both online and off, since\u00a0#MeToo. Until social media and other websites listen to these concerns, and act, they are letting girls and young women like me down.\u201dIt comes after The Telegraph launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.It follows warnings that children as young as five are increasingly \u201cperpetrating sexual abuse\u201d because of what they are seeing on social media.Increasing numbers of primary school pupils are exhibiting \u201charmful sexual behaviour\u201d as a result of the web - with others groomed in their bedrooms in live broadcasts, experts told MPs.The charity Barnardo\u2019s said children were increasingly becoming perpetrators as well as victims, touching others\u2019 private parts, or forcing them to watch pornography.Their evidence to MPs highlights growing evidence of an explosion of \u201clive grooming\u201d - with parents oblivious that children were sharing explicit content from their bedrooms.Experts said middle-class parents had no idea that their children were being coerced into stripping for strangers, in scenes which were live-streamed globally, and harvested by paedophilic websites.Britain\u2019s top police chief on child safety last week\u00a0warned that live streaming has become a \"magnet for paedophiles\", with the NSPCC revealing that twice as many children are doing it as was previously thought.Last year, it was estimated that 10 per cent of seven to 16 -year-olds live streamed, but this has leapt to 24 per cent as social media platforms have raced to add video to their sites and apps, according to a study into children\u2019s online lives by the NSPCC and London Grid for Learning.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
