Discussed as a future \u00adChelsea manager, Lampard \u00adbelieves the prospect should not be entertained until he has achieved the success to merit it.\u201cNo, because I am pragmatic about those things,\u201d he said when asked if he dreams of managing the club one day. \u201cIn football your next game is all-important. I don\u2019t see anything beyond playing Chelsea, and then I will concentrate on \u00adBirmingham at the weekend.\u201cSo to dream is one thing, but in reality, what happens next will rely on what I do here. Hopefully I can bring success to this club.\u201dLampard is still held in huge \u00adaffection by the club\u2019s supporters after playing such an influential role in them winning 13 trophies in as many years until he left in 2014, just before his 36th birthday, after 211 goals in 648 games.As a result, should Derby follow up their shock victory at Jose Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United in the last round, he will refrain from celebrating \u2013 just as he did after scoring for Manchester City against Chelsea in September 2014.\u201cIt will be easy [to show restraint] because I respect the club,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I scored against them, I didn\u2019t celebrate. I wouldn\u2019t have done in a million years. Although I was doing my job, I love Chelsea and had a strong bond with the fans that will hopefully never go.\u201cAs a manager, I will be respectful because I have to appreciate what the club did for me. I will feel proud and honoured going back to a place I called home for 13 years and still feels like home.\u201cThis is my working home now and I have got a great affiliation with this club already, but I can\u2019t forget 13 years of my career. So it will be a very special night.\u201d They still chant Lampard\u2019s name at the Bridge. \u201cTo get that support when you\u2019re working for an opposing team will feel nice.\u201dBut he is determined to forge a managerial career to match his playing one. And one of the things he has taken from his time at Chelsea is the desire for his players to truly identify with the club.\u201cI was part of a very good era at Chelsea. They sing about Dennis Wise, John Terry and Didier Drogba and rightly so,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing we did do, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re trying to do here, is we really \u2018felt\u2019 the club. It\u2019s important you recognise history, and the recent history at Chelsea has been strong.\u201dAnother example of the \u201cLampard way\u201d is video analysis of players in training, which led Derby midfielder Tom Huddlestone to say players are \u201cdug out\u201d if they perform below the expected standards. \u201cI wish I\u2019d had people showing me back more things because individual analysis didn\u2019t happen for big parts of my career,\u201d said Lampard.\u201cYou have to be not fragile and think \u2018maybe I could have improved in that situation\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018digging someone out\u2019, it\u2019s about looking for improvement, and we will keep doing it.\u201cFor example, after West Brom, I didn\u2019t show the four goals we scored, I showed them how much we won the ball back, because everyone, collectively, sprinted everywhere.\u201cI get more enjoyment out of that than for Harry Wilson\u2019s free-kick against Manchester United.\u201dAt the moment, Lampard has another challenge \u2013 sleepless nights, caused by baby daughter Patricia and by wrestling with tactics and formations.\u201cOne night last week in the middle of the night I was on bottle duty, making up the bottles for [wife] Christine then to feed her,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was doing that, and considering formations and players. My wife is having some sleepless nights, too, but we\u2019re certainly enjoying it.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
