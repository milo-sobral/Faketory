{"id": "\nPablo Hernandez inspires Leeds United as they dispatch Ipswich to go top of Championship\n", "paragraph": "If Leeds are sometimes accused of living in the past, they only had to turn the clock back to August to return to winning ways and the top of the table.Kemar Roofe was named the first player of the month in this season\u2019s Championship but injuries meant he and Pablo Hernandez had not started together in an eight-week spell, when Leeds only won two of nine games.As they were belatedly reunited, the striker opened the scoring and the Spaniard earned two assists. Leeds, who kicked off in fifth, leapfrogged four promotion rivals. If it was fitting Roofe took Leeds to the summit, Ipswich remain\u00a0rooted to the foot of the table.\u201cIt is always important to be the first,\u201d said manager Marcelo Bielsa. \u201cOur team was constantly offensive. We had 10 clear chances to score.\u201dThey could have got more than two in a dominant display, with Ezgjan Alioski whipping a spectacular shot against the post from an acute angle and Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski making fine saves from both the Macedonian and Adam Forshaw.Roofe had broken the deadlock with an emphatic header from Hernandez\u2019s cross before captain and centre-back Liam Cooper supplied a classy finish to the Spaniard\u2019s cutback.\u201cHe was very important,\u201d added Bielsa. \u201cHe played as if he was never injured and he was very intelligent in his game.\u201dIpswich were outclassed. Paul Hurst had made seven changes after the 2-0 defeat to QPR, but got an identical result. He has a solitary win to his name and his position is coming under increasing scrutiny.Owner Marcus Evans is yet to reassure Hurst he has backing and the manager admitted he cannot ignore reports about his future. \u201cAre they healthy? Realistically, no,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can do is focus on your job and if it is deemed not good enough, then so be it.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
