I cannot imagine what will happen after 13 Aban (Nov. 4). I am scared. I am worried. I am desperate,\" elementary school teacher Pejman Sarafnejad, 43, a father of three in Tehran told Reuters.\u00a0\"I cannot even buy rice to feed my children or pay my rent.\"Of\u00a0Iran\u2019s 81 million citizens, it will likely be the poor and middle class whose lives are made most uncomfortable.Young Iranians face a markedly different future to the one they had hoped for when sanctions were rolled back as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.\"I'm worried about the future,\" said Erfan Yusufi, the 30-year-old owner of a Tehran coffee shop that is struggling to stay afloat amidst rising prices and falling incomes.\"Our generation starts each day not knowing what will become of us.\"\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
