I think there are 10 changes in the squad and some big names missing out.\u201dThe first half was edgy and ended 6-6 after a penalty from England centre Jake Connors, followed by a try from the Kiwis\u2019 23-year-old captain and full-back Dallin Watene-Zelezniak.\u00a0Stand-off, Shaun Johnson converted and Makinson scored his first try at 35 minutes to give the hosts a psychological boost heading into the interval.The second half was at times ill-tempered and despite wing Ken Maumalo crossing early on, New Zealand started to lose field position due to ill-discipline.\u00a0A Johnson penalty put the Kiwis 14-6 ahead.With Makinson securing his brace by the 56th minute, the score was back to 14-10 as Connor missed the conversion.However, the Hull FC man would atone by scoring the equalising try off the back of slick passing from hooker Josh Hodgson to second row Elliot Whitehead, with Connor going over to go level at 14-14.Makinson had his hat-trick on the back of a team try which Catalans Dragons-bound Sam Tomkins converted to give England a six-point lead with four minutes left.Bennett relished the tense nature of the fixture. \u201cIt was a typical Test match today, there was plenty of pushing and shoving. There was a bit of aggro, and no one wanting to give up anything,\u201d he said.Bennett, who has long been an advocate for rugby league\u2019s international expansion, voiced his hopes that when the international federation meets in York this week, there will be more opportunities for Test matches which will give the code increased exposure ahead of England hosting the 2021 men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups.\u201cGet the politics out of the way, the players want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope people stand up for the game and give us all what we want: international rugby played between the best teams and players.\u201d\u00a0\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
