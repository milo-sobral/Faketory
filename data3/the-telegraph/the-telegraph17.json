It means the rest of the world, which makes up 97 per cent of the population, are not tailored to and ignored.\u201cIt is similar to their attitude on fake news, they only seemed to care whether the US news they were showing Americans was correct, and followed their rules. However, I am afraid they are going to have to change that approach.\u201dSome MPs have called for the issue to be addressed before any US cars get anywhere close to roads in the UK, because in March this year a women in the Arizona was killed by an autonomous Uber car that did not see her.Adam Holloway MP said: \u201cThese machines will eventually make our lives and environment better, but in the meantime no one else must be killed or injured.\u201d\u00a0Engineers have said the only way to solve the issue is to make sure that US driverless cars know what British vehicles look like in every type of environmental condition.\u00a0Chris Posch, who is the director of automotive engineering at FLIR, told The Sunday Telegraph: \u201cYou would have to show it thousands of images of London red buses, not just in good weather in the day, but images of them at night, in the rain and in fog.\u201d\u201cThis cannot be considered a mature technology if it cannot recognise a red bus but it can spot a Chevrolet,\u201d said Tom Brake MP.\u00a0Uber and Google have been contacted for comment.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
