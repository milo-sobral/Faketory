{"id": "\nPrimary school pupils should be taught what it means to be LGBT, Royal College of Paediatricians says\u00a0\n", "paragraph": "Primary\u00a0school children should be taught what it means to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, leading doctors say.The Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health (RCPCH) is urging ministers to go further in their guidance on sex and relationship classes, which will become compulsory from 2020.Draft Government recommendations say schools are free to determine how they address lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, ensuring teaching is \u201csensitive and age-appropriate\u201d.But senior doctors are calling on the Government to be more upfront, saying that primary school children should be given clear information about different types of sexuality.In response to a consultation on the matter, the Royal College says: \u201cThere needs to be a clear statement that LGBT people and relationships are part of teaching about healthy relationships in primary school. This can be demonstrated in relation to families - but also it is helpful to children to learn the meaning of terms such as lesbian, gay and bisexual\u201d.Paediatricians also said children should be taught the proper names for body parts, and aboutemotional changes during puberty.Dr Max Davie, the college\u2019s officer for health promotion, said: \u201cWe need to talk to children like they are intelligent beings. They are curious. My children know people who are gay or lesbian, it\u2019s not that big a stretch to be talking to children about bisexuality.\u201dFrank discussions about such matters would prevent \u201csniggering at the back,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is about giving things their proper names and demystifiying them. \u00a0There is nothing mysterious or shameful about it, it\u2019s not about promoting LGBT as superior to anything else, it\u2019s just setting out the facts,\u201d he said.A public consultation on Government guidance on relationships, sex and health education closed last week. It follows leglisation which means relationships education will become compulsory in primary schools, with sex education in secondary schools, from 2020. \u00a0The college said the Government\u2019s current plans do not go far enough.Dr Davie said: \u201cWe have got a strong committment against discrimination on LGBT and we need to commit to that.\u201dThe senior doctor suggested such discussions were best when children are in the final two years of primary school, aged between nine and 11.However, he urged teachers to take care in explaining transgender issues, amid an increasingly heated debate about a Government consultation on allowing people to \u201cself-identify\u201d as their chosen gender.\u201cI think it\u2019s very contentious so I think you have to be quite bland,\u201d he said, suggesting that primary school children might be told \u201csome people identify in different ways; you have to love and respect them.\u201d\u201cIt is a tricky nuanced debate so i think its best to stick to talking about a culture of love and respect,\u201d he said.Primary school pupils should also be given information about healthy behaviours during pregnancy and parenting, the RCPCH said, including familiarity with breastfeeding.\u201cIt is about how to grow up in an environment where breast feeding is normalised, being matter of fact about it,\u201d Dr Davie said.In it\u2019s call for evidence, the Department for Education said opinions were split as to whether it is appropriate to teach any subjects relating to sex education at primary school, and about when children should be taught about LGBT relationships.A DfE Spokesperson said: \u201cWe want all children to grow up to become happy, healthy and safe, which is why we are making Relationships Education compulsory for all primary schools as well as Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) compulsory for all secondary schools.\u201cThe draft guidance is clear that teaching should look at healthy relationships \u2013 which includes LGBT relationships \u2013 and that all pupils learn about equality. The draft guidance is also clear that RSE should be relevant to all pupils, whatever their developing sexuality or identity, in an age-appropriate way.\u201d\u00a0\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
