Amid the years of chaos and terror in Ukraine, one date stands out. On July 17 2014, a surface-to-air missile killed 283 passengers and 15 crew aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.\u201cThe plane was shot down close to where I was living with my parents,\u201d recalls Bernard. \u201cIt was when I was at the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 this all started. I heard rumours about the bombs and war.\u201cThe situation was hard and tense. I was very young when I moved to Shakhtar Donetsk and it was in the first season the war broke out. We had to change our city and move to the capital [Kiev] and lost the infrastructure we had \u2013 the training base \u2013 and had to fly to every game. It was a big learning experience over five years.\u201dBernard recalls the sense of fear and panic. \u201cThere is no doubt about it. There were blockades to enter and exit the cities. Cars were searched for bombs and weapons,\u201d he said.\u201cThere were many players who lost their houses and flats. A lot of the South American players wanted to break from their contracts and went to the courts. A lot of the appeals were lost. I did not try to leave but a lot of people wanted to flee the city. Many did not have the money to leave. A lot of people died in the war.\u201dBernard appeared in Brazil\u2019s 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany at the 2014 World Cup. For context, the match took place nine days before the Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down. Ukraine was already at war. Bernard, 22 at the time, had more on his mind than football that summer. He has not been picked for his country since. That is something he hopes to rectify by excelling in England.\u201cI am sure the majority \u2013 if not all players \u2013 want to be playing here. It is the best league in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since 2014, it\u2019s been my dream to return [to the Brazil team] but in order to get back I have to be playing well here and adapting to the way Everton play. I just need to put in the effort and hard work here to help Everton. Hopefully, an opportunity will come up in the future.\u201dAfter consistent links to the Premier League, Bernard finally left Donetsk to become one of Marco Silva\u2019s first recruits, promising the attacking midfield guile Everton have been craving.There are tentative comparisons to David Silva, perhaps due to the diminutive stature (5ft 5in) as well as his position and skill. There was a time that was not the compliment it is today.\u201cI have always faced prejudice for my height and physique,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Atletico Mineiro [his first club in Brazil], I was released on two occasions. Obviously, this caused me some concern but I did get another opportunity and once I started playing, I improved. I just had to show my qualities every day in training and in all games, because I knew this would be a problem I would face on a daily basis.By @ToffeeAnalysis pic.twitter.com/o0FS18gDu3\u201cI\u2019ve always followed my dad\u2019s advice to overcome the problems of height and physical-related issues I might come across. I can use my qualities to compensate for any of these physical issues, so it\u2019s not a worry for me. On the pitch, if you are quick with your feet and your mind, these small margins can make a difference.\u201dBernard also benefited from a high-profile advocate of his ability during his formative years. \u201cPlaying alongside Ronaldinho was important for me because he was always an idol of mine and somebody that I\u2019d followed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe offered me advice and help that has served me well throughout my career to this day.\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for him and I\u2019m thankful to God for being given the opportunity to play alongside him. We won an important competition together, the Copa Libertadores, so I started my career alongside him.\u201cI\u2019m grateful to have been a team-mates of his. Even though it was at the latter stage of his career, he was still very dedicated and it was important for us to have him in our team.\u201dSince his move to Goodison Park, injuries have been the biggest concern to the 26-year-old. Now fit, he is reassured his only anxieties are related to sport rather than security. \u201cThe only thing I have to worry about here is playing football,\u201d he said.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
