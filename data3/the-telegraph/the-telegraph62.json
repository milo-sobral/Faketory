{"id": "\nGranit Xhaka\u2019s transformation under Unai Emery a game-changer for improving Arsenal\n", "paragraph": "\nFollow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis\nIt was a measure of how much Arsenal have changed in just a few months under Unai Emery that the head coach\u2019s reaction to a sliding tackle was almost as wild as when Alexandre Lacazette scored their late equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Liverpool.The suspicion is that it was not just the nature of the crunching challenge, on an accelerating Mohamed Salah, that so invigorated a fist-pumping Emery, but also the identity of the tackler. There was Granit Xhaka, hurtling out of nowhere to whip the ball away from Salah at the last possible moment.Well, it looked like Xhaka, and that was the name on the back of the shirt. But by almost every other measure this was a totally different player to the midfielder who so regularly disappointed in the biggest games under Ars\u00e8ne\u00a0Wenger.Liberated by the phenomenal Lucas Torreira alongside him, Xhaka was as dynamic and destructive as he has been in an Arsenal shirt. He made more passes than anyone else on the pitch, more recoveries than anyone else on the pitch and more tackles than anyone else on the pitch. It was a performance of spirit and intensity, both individually from Xhaka and collectively from the team, and it was a clear demonstration of how Emery has injected a new purpose into this club.\u201cI enjoy the small details,\u201d Emery said when asked about his reaction to the Xhaka challenge. \u201cIndividual actions, defensively and offensively.\u201dEmery does not just enjoy those \u201cdetails\u201d, of course. He obsesses over them. In training, he will physically move players into the correct position, focusing their bodies and minds on the intricate demands of their roles in his system. \u201cEach game we know what we do,\u201d said Xhaka. \u201cWe know well the opposition, where they are good and where they are not. He [Emery] is important. He helps us, not only me but all the players, with the small things. The tactical things. You can see that on the pitch.\u201dXhaka is the most obvious beneficiary of this more hands-on approach and proved it against a Liverpool side who had grown used to having it their own way against Arsenal. \u201cA lot of small things have changed,\u201d said Xhaka, who was instrumental in Arsenal\u2019s stirring recovery from James Milner\u2019s opening goal. \u201cWe have great character. We knew we would not lose this game because we were so good and showed that character again.\u201dEmery admitted that the efforts of his players had left them exhausted at the final whistle, but that is what he wants from games like these. He would also like the crowd as whipped up as they were on Saturday, inspired by the unusual amount of grit on display. \u201cI think we are getting the balance in intensity,\u201d Emery said. \u201c[Against Liverpool] we need to push a lot and I think when the supporters are enjoying with the players, I think also the players give their all in their performance and their desire.\u201dThe impact of Torreira cannot be overstated. The Uruguayan already looks a steal at \u00a325\u200amillion, not just for his own actions but for what he brings to the others around him. \u201cEvery game is better and better,\u201d Xhaka said. \u201cHe [Torreira] is so important. He knows when to go and when to stay. He brings good balance between offence and defence.\u201dEmery agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for our balance that we have two midfielders like Xhaka and Torreira, because the balance in midfield is also important for the balance in defence and our balance offensively,\u201d the head coach said.Having lost to Manchester City and Chelsea, this was a result that proved Arsenal are capable of going toe to toe \u2013 and, indeed, elbow to elbow \u2013 with the finest teams in the league. This was where they so often fell short under Wenger, and it is in these matches that their hopes of finishing in the top four will be truly tested. \u201cIf you see this game, you can see we are ready for the top four,\u201d Xhaka said.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
