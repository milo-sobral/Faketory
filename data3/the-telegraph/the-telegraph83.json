A record was broken for the country after 50 years surely that deserves some sort of recognition.\u201dShe later added: \u201cSorry there is people being positive and that\u2019s so nice .... however returned back to England today and been hit with all the negativity to why he shouldn\u2019t get rewarded ... welcome home.\u201dWith Danny Welbeck already ruled out through injury, 27 of the 28 players Southgate originally selected met up on Monday \u2013 including Kieran Trippier and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.Loftus-Cheek was left out of the Chelsea squad to face Everton due to back pain, while Trippier had to be taken off in Tottenham\u2019s win at Crystal Palace with a groin problem. But both players reported for duty and remained with the rest of the squad on Monday night ahead of Tuesday\u2019s first full training session, when they will be assessed again.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
