{"id": "\nFormer Spurs Ladies star Eartha Pond on helping Grenfell survivors: 'I live in the area, know people from the tower'\n", "paragraph": "Eartha Pond was 11 years old when she was scouted for Arsenal, practicing with a school friend at the Harrow Youth Club in the shadow of a tower block. 23 years later, on\u00a0June 14,\u00a02017, two weeks after Pond had won promotion to the Women\u2019s Super League with Tottenham, flames leapt at the same tower. The conflagration at Grenfell killed, official figures say, 72 people. The friend who had played alongside Pond two decades earlier was that night frantically trying to contact her uncle and sister, both residents in the tower. Only one survived.The following day, as Grenfell\u2019s blackened husk smouldered against the sky, Pond opened a Crowdfunding page, raising over \u00a385,000. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually think there were people who\u2019d stayed in the tower, because it was such a blaze,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought people had got out and would need stuff. As it unfolded that people were in there... it was just heartbreaking. I live in the area so I see and know people from the tower. I\u2019m still connected.\u201dPond grew up in Queen\u2019s Park, \u201cliterally opposite the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. On the right-hand side of the road is Westminster, and then adjacent is Brent. Our communities intertwine.\u201d In the days after the fire, she combined her role as Spurs\u2019 centre-half with her duties as the vice-chair of Queens Park Community Council. \u201cI\u2019m trying to plug gaps where I can,\u201d she says, \u201cwaiting for their guidance on what people need, rather than assuming.\u201dShe mobilised the local sports centre. \u201cWe put some flyers together: if you need a shower, to drop your kids off, we\u2019re open around the clock. Then I headed straight down to Grenfell. I was sorting boxes, sorting clothes. I\u2019d emptied out my house, was going to the supermarket. Everyone was pulling together. The different boroughs were all down at Grenfell, saying, \u2018This is what\u2019s needed - put this there\u2019. Whilst all this madness was going on, I think people were waiting for an authority body to come down and say, \u2018This is what we need to do\u2019. And that just never came.\u201dThe myriad failings surrounding the fire are now being analysed as part of the Grenfell public inquiry. Last month, the survivors began to give their testimonies. It has been traumatic in the extreme for a community still learning to grieve. Three days after Pond and I speak, a video of a burning effigy of Grenfell goes viral.For many, the healing process has barely begun. \u201cWe\u2019re just on autopilot, still, over a year on,\u201d Pond explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with it until maybe three, four, even 10 years down the line. It depends on the individual and what triggers the start of that process. It could be fireworks. It could be a loud noise, a scream, a shout they hear later on in life. As a government and a community, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re prepared for that. I\u2019m not too sure we are.\u201dThe PM has responded to calls for a more diverse panel of experts to contribute to the enquiry, in the hope survivors will trust the review. \u201c[But] I don\u2019t think they do, to be honest,\u201d says Pond. \u201cThe venue, for instance, is not suitable. You\u2019re looking at traumatised people being put in a room that\u2019s not big enough to facilitate all the people that have lost loved ones or survived the fire. They want to be able to go through this process as comfortably as possible. Those small steps go a long, long way to rebuilding community trust.\u201dPond considers the combustible cladding that encased Grenfell, and, 17 months on, still coats scores of buildings across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s just knowing: is that something the government care about? Is it something significant enough for them to make changes? This is where there are maybe barriers regarding where you live, or your upbringing, or who shouts loudest. Those are the people who are heard. [But] no matter what class you\u2019re from, or creed, or religion, or political background, wrong is wrong. Just being heard is crucial.\u201cUntil they [the elite] are affected, I don\u2019t think we really see change. But it\u2019s a humanitarian issue. How do we get people who have an impact on policy to listen? Until we have people around those tables, having those conversations, I don\u2019t think there will be much change.\u201dShe is worried, too, about the potential medical consequences. \u201cPeople across the UK flooded Grenfell to help after the fire and took in the smoke. Have they been tracking the toxins, the illnesses in the community? These are things that people have been saying since week one. You\u2019d think, for such a major, major event, someone would be leading on the welfare of the community.\u201cThe survivors are making some really poignant points about how they feel and what they see. There were small hazards that could have impacted what happened at Grenfell that weren\u2019t listened to. They built up like a dripping effect, then they\u2019ve had that fire.\u201dPond does not even pause as she delivers her final verdict. \u201cThese are the sort of things where the community says, \u2018How can you not have someone tracking this? Are we not important?\u2019\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
