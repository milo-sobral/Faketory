{"id": "\nSchools should not attempt to diagnose children with mental health disorders,\u00a0 Government adviser says\n", "paragraph": "Schools should not attempt to diagnose stressed children with mental health disorders, a Government adviser has said.Tom Bennett, who guides ministers on behaviour issues in schools, warned that teachers must not give out \u201camateur diagnoses\u201d to pupils, adding that there is a danger of \u201cmedicalising\u201d normal childhood emotions. \u00a0His comments come as the Department for Education (DfE) publish new guidance on mental health and behaviour in schools, in which teachers are encouraged to refer children on to external specialists if they display symptoms of mental health issues.\u201cSchools need to be careful not to overreach their expertise and try to do the job of trained experts in the mental health arena,\u201d said Mr Bennett, who was commissioned by the DfE to carry review behaviour policies in schools.\u00a0He said that teachers who tell their students that they are suffering from a mental health condition run the risk of exacerbating problems rather than solving them. \u00a0\u201cIf teachers try to be amateur diagnosticians, they can lead children to believe that their symptoms are something more serious. You can exacerbate stress by making people worry about it,\u201d Mr Bennett told The Daily Telegraph.\u00a0\u201cTeachers are not trained clinicians and schools need to be careful not to be amateur diagnoses. There is a danger of medicalising normal responses.\u00a0 If a child is stressed because of an exam or if a child is going through a bereavement that is not a mental health problem.\u201dMr Bennett told how growing awareness about mental health issues has given rise to confusion about what constitutes a symptom.\u201cSchools are by their nature institutions that are at the front line of public service, and are frequently a first port of call for issues,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIts perhaps understandable that schools and teachers are exposed to these issues. But there is a lack of understanding about what mental health issues are.\u201dNew DfE guidance published on Monday\u00a0says that schools must actively promote mental wellbeing of pupils and ensure they are resilient.\u00a0Last month, the Treasury announced that every state school will be given a dedicated mental health professional to help children deal with the impact of social media.Philip Hammond said that mental health funding will be increased from nearly \u00a312billion to more than \u00a314billion within five years.\u00a0The announcement was the first stage of the NHS long-term plan to help achieve \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between mental and physical health services.The new mental health teams will be overseen by NHS professionals and help children with \u201cmild and moderate mental health problems\u201d including the effects of cyber bullying. Schools will also be encouraged to appoint a \u201cdesignated mental health lead\u201d, who would be a teacher.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
