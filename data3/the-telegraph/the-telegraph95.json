{"id": "\nRacing diary: Colin Tizzard's milk empire runs its course\n", "paragraph": "It is goodbye Daisy, Buttercup, Marigold and Henrietta. Well, not quite, as most modern dairy cows answer to a three-figure number stamped on their backsides, but 60 years of milk production at Venn Farm will come to an end on Tuesday and the headline \u201cDairy farmer wins Gold Cup\u201d will not be applicable should Colin Tizzard\u2019s Native River win the big race again in March.Avid readers of Farmers Weekly will be all over this but, from 3am tomorrow, the wagons will have been rolling into Venn Farm, Milborne Port, to ship 250 \u2013 mainly Friesian \u2013 dairy cows to Sedgemoor market near Bridgwater where they will come under the hammer at 11am.The last pint has been coaxed from the last milker and, from now on, should Colin need some for his porridge, he will have to get it from the shops. So, it is with mixed emotions that he will see the cows, the parlour, their cubicles and the bulk tank sold off.The dairy was started by his father in the 1950s and Colin has run it for nearly 30 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been a dairy farmer all my life,\u201d he said, \u201cand it has got us to where we are now, but it is a business decision. We\u2019ve invested in the racing yard at Spurles Farm but haven\u2019t done so much at Venn. To attract decent staff we\u2019d need a new parlour, drains and you\u2019d be looking at a \u00a3750,000 investment.\u201dAfter Tizzard sent out just the five winners on Sunday, fellow trainers should be worried that now he can give his full attention to his horses. However, he did admit it was five years since he grappled with an udder, with son Joe in charge.He is not, however, getting out of cows altogether. He is switching to beef production. \u201cDairy is a bit like the horses,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Beef is a part-time job.\u201dOne-eyed horses are relatively common \u2013 one-eared less so. But Lucinda Russell\u2019s Ryalex, a winner at Carlisle on Monday, stands out from a crowd of bay geldings because he is missing his left lug.Apart from hearing, ears on horses are useful to help the bridle stay in place but Ryalex, who lost one when he got his head stuck in the cattle pen in which he was stabled in Ireland prior to his purchase, has perfect hearing and his bridle never looked like falling over his head on Monday.When Tristan Voorspuy was murdered trying to protect his property in Kenya in March 2017, it sent shock waves around the world as the political situation in that country deteriorated before last year\u2019s elections. Voorspuy, whose brother Rufus was a trainer in Sussex, settled in Africa and set up Offbeat Safaris, which offered riding holidays in the Kenyan bush among the big game, about which he had an expert knowledge.If he did not give his guests a near-death experience every day, he did not consider he was doing his job properly.Consequently, he attracted a large number of racing folk among his clientele.One claim to fame was that he was about the only man to have ever put the wind up Lord Daresbury on horseback; crossing a flooded river with hippos to the left and crocodiles to the right, Daresbury and his then seven-year-old son, Jake, both ended up parting company with their horses and swimming for it.Haydock\u2019s chairman described another day of the safari, on which two people, including Voorspuy, broke bones, like \u201ca novice chase at Market Rasen\u201d.Mementos of his famous rides include a broken neck for Jessica Harrington, whose mount put its foot down an aardvark hole, while Charles Barnett\u2019s daughter, Louisa, broke her femur.The antidote to health and safety, all he had in his first-aid bag for Louisa was an Elastoplast and some Savlon.But, using his diaries and the testament of family and friends Voorpuy\u2019s story: Life On The Edge (Quiller \u00a320); has been beautifully written by Adrian Dangar, who will be signing copies at Cheltenham, where Voorspuy regularly donated safaris to the charity auction, on Friday.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
