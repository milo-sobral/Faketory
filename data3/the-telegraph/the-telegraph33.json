We only have one point after three games so it will be very difficult,\u201d said Pochettino.\u201cThe feeling is not so good because I think we deserved to win. When you are in a good situation to kill the game and you don\u2019t kill it, you have to blame yourself. We completely dominated, we need to be more aggressive and score more than two goals because we had the chances.\u201cIf you don\u2019t win, you don\u2019t deserve to be in the Champions League. You draw and we put in a dangerous situation our chances of qualification.\u201cWe need to win the three games we have to play and some results that help us achieve one place for qualification will be so, so difficult.\u201dPochettino declined to criticise Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris or Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic, who was erratic for much of the evening, for the game\u2019s pivotal moment.Lloris was given a straight red card 10 minutes from time for a reckless tackle on PSV\u2019s Hirving Lozano as he rushed out of his penalty area.\u201cI\u2019m not going to blame any player. I blame myself. I am responsible. We didn\u2019t win. If you want to blame somebody blame me,\u201d said the Spurs manager.\u201cIn my opinion it wasn\u2019t a red card but we can\u2019t blame the referee. Why should Hugo apologise? One day when I was young I made a big mistake and my manager said to me you don\u2019t need to apologise.\u201cOnly those on the pitch can make a mistake.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a mistake, it was an action and a sending off - it can happen a lot in football.\u201dSpurs return to action in the Premier League on Monday night with a game against leaders Manchester City at Wembley.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
