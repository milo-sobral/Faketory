{"id": "\nEngland embrace new high-stakes horizons and cultivating 'good habits' of winning\n", "paragraph": "It may be getting a little ahead of themselves but the question is if England do defeat Croatia at Wembley on Sunday and go on to win their top tier of the Nations League come June then does that constitute a legitimate trophy that ends the fabled 52 years of hurt?At the end of a momentous 2018, the 17th game of a year that has seen England reach a World Cup semi-final, defeat Spain on their home turf and bid farewell to the country\u2019s greatest ever goalscorer it is one worth asking.The Nations League began as something of a running joke, the new competition format that required a five-minute explanation if indeed you could find someone who understood it, but as a concept it is growing in popularity.It has served up a strange menu of games for England, including a 2-1 defeat by Luis Enrique\u2019s Spain when they came to these shores, the behind-closed-door goalless draw against Croatia in Rijeka and then that exhilarating 3-2 victory in Seville. Suddenly there is a game that has caught the imagination at Wembley where a full-house will see a high-stakes shoot-out between two teams playing one another for the third time in 130 days. Even a score draw will see England finish bottom of the group and relegated to the B-tier of the Nations League.Southgate considered the value of the Nations League \u2013 less than a World Cup, obviously, but potentially double a Tournoi \u2013 and pointed out that the European Championship, launched in 1960, took some time to establish itself.\u201cIt\u2019s not a European Championship or a World Cup but it\u2019s good habits to get into,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to win big matches where there is a bit more pressure and more emphasis in front of a full house.\u201cThese are really good experiences for the team and wherever it sits we won\u2019t know. When they started to have a European Championship many years ago a lot of teams didn\u2019t enter and these things evolve.\u201cThe idea of a competition where all the best teams are playing against each other was an exciting concept, I thought. We won\u2019t know until time passes where it sits.\u201dThe notion of England finishing top of a group including two top-tier football nations felt a long way off this time last year but the progress has been rapid. Even so, what about changing the perception that England fail to beat top teams in competitive games? \u201cIt\u2019s not perception,\u201d Southgate said, \u201cit\u2019s the truth. We haven\u2019t beaten top teams historically. When I have looked back it just has not happened.\u201cWould that change it for good? No, because every time you go into a round of matches you have to prove yourselves again.\u201cWhat has been exciting is that we have looked at the summer and what we achieved but, OK, what do we do to progress that forward?\u201dThere will be a wholesale change of the team from the one that beat the United States 3-0 on Thursday with only Jordan Pickford from the XI that begun that game likely to start against Croatia. At the end of a World Cup year Southgate has changed formation from 3-5-2 to 4-3-3 and Ross Barkley is now preferred in midfield to Dele Alli. With the potential exception of Harry Maguire and Kieran Trippier this could be Southgate\u2019s strongest XI that faces Croatia and you could make the argument that both of those may not be picked ahead of Joe Gomez and Kyle Walker.The match also brings together two sides with a new rivalry, exemplified this week by the comments from Croatia full-back Tin Jedvaj who said that his side should be favourites and that England were beaten in the summer \u201cwithout any problems\u201d. Nothing will make up for the defeat suffered in Moscow to Croatia but it sounded like Southgate had paid attention to the mood coming out of the opposition camp.In the summer he used the words of Hakan Mild the former Sweden midfielder who said that England were \u201cspoiled children\u201d before the World Cup quarter-final between the two nations. \u201cWhenever people speak, you give the opposition the opportunity to use those words as they see fit,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThere were some comments from Sweden in the summer that we definitely used to our advantage. And you can steer that in any way, because half the players thought it was a current Sweden player and it wasn\u2019t, so I wasn\u2019t going to argue with them!\u201dBeating Croatia would make it the best England year since 1996, and send Southgate into his four-month break renewed for the challenge ahead. He chose not to comment on the current dispute at the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association between chairman Ben Purkiss and chief executive Gordon Taylor because he said he had barely had time to pay it any attention.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in the world this week and my wife often says to me \u2018You do know there is a bloody world going on, it is not all about your bloody football team.\u2019 Especially when we\u2019re in the intensity of a camp and you\u2019re working from seven in the morning to 11.30pm at night just getting the team and the tactics right. There\u2019s little time for the real world. But I\u2019ll look forward to catching up on it all.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
