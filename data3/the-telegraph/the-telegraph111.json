I am grateful to the production teams and to the BBC who have made this possible.\u201cIt has been exhilarating following the twists and turns of British politics from John Major in 1994, through the Blair and Brown years to Cameron and May. I am not giving up broadcasting.\u201cInstead, after years in the studio, I now plan to return to my first love: reporting.\u201dThe search for a new presenter comes after the BBC gender pay gap scandal, which saw an embarrassing disparity between the salaries commanded by senior men and high-profile women at the corporation.Dimbleby\u2019s own salary was not published, under a loophole which meant shows made by independent production companies, such as Question Time were exempt, but he is thought to be among the BBC's highest earners.He is one of only three presenters in the history of Question Time, which was previously anchored by Peter Sissons from 1989 to 1993 and Robin Day from 1979 to 1989.During his BBC career Dimbleby has also presented political programmes such as Panorama and chaired many debates including the Party Leaders\u2019 debates in the run up to General Elections since 2010.He has been the BBC\u2019s anchorman for all General Elections since 1979 and presented the broadcaster\u2019s coverage of the first referendum in Europe, a role he repeated in 2016 for the BBC\u2019s coverage of the EU Referendum.Asked in a magazine interview whether she wanted the job shortly before the vacancy was announced, Wark admitted: \u201cI think there will be many people when David Dimbleby decides he doesn\u2019t want to do it any longer.\u201cI think I will be one of them, but I\u2019m sure lots of people will throw their hats in the ring for that.\u201dA BBC spokesman refused to comment. Sources said the corporation does not comment on speculation whilst the recruitment process is still ongoing.\u00a0\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
