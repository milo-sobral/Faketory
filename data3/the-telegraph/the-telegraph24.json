Earlier this month, Rapid Vienna replaced Goran Djuricin with Dietmar Kuhbauer ahead of their trip to Ibrox, but the change did not prevent Rangers achieving a 3-1 victory that left them on top of their group.\u201cIt\u2019s slightly different to the situation with Rapid as Spartak have made a promotion from within,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cLast time it was an entirely new manager, so we were expecting a different philosophy and an entirely different way of playing.\u201cWhen you promote from within you normally wouldn\u2019t make such drastic changes. It\u2019s very difficult to predict how they will approach it and indeed the outcome of the match.\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s nothing we can control, we have to look at ourselves as we always do. They are sitting seventh in their league but I think it\u2019s a false position.\u201cThat said, if that\u2019s where you are in the league, because of the size and stature of a club like Spartak, then you know you are going to be under pressure.\u201cA club like Spartak, with so much Champions League experience, expect to be competing at the top of the league. In terms of us, it doesn\u2019t change anything. We are at home, we have a game plan, and whether they have changed the manager or not, it doesn\u2019t impact on what we want to do.\u201dAlthough the implications of a Rangers victory are obvious \u2013 the odds would favour their qualification for the next stage of the tournament and make Spartak favourites to be eliminated \u2013 the evolution of the group has not offered a sure guide to form. Rangers have drawn away to Villarreal and beaten Rapid, who in turn have beaten Spartak, while Villarreal left Moscow with a 3-3 draw.\u201cRapid beat them in the opening match, so it\u2019s a very difficult one to judge,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cFor my money, they are around the same level as Villarreal but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much between all the teams, to be honest.\u201cI was happy with every aspect of our last performance against Rapid. We managed to get in front and we scored late on. We did so much work in the first half, matching their aggression and grinding them down. We got our rewards late on. The atmosphere was excellent.\u201cAll the talk afterwards was it was like the atmosphere of old. It drives the team on. I felt it as a player myself. We have to ignite it all, though, with our performance.\u201dGerrard will not be able to call on Scott Arfield, who is injured, but Ryan Jack is again ready for action and Kyle Lafferty is also in contention. The manager, meanwhile, offered an unadorned vision of the beautiful game in an era of stats, sports science and algorithms.\u201cFootball doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019m telling these players now what I got told in 1999 by G\u00e9rard\u00a0Houllier and Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Winning teams have the same principles, the same tempo, desire, commitment.\u201cSome coaches try to overcomplicate things. They\u2019ve got the gift of the gab and the silver tongue, but I haven\u2019t. I tell my team how it is and what\u2019s expected at this club. I\u2019m not going to stand here and try to change the game of football. It\u2019s been going on long before I was created.\u201cI have listened to certain people throughout my career and they just talked b------s. They did. The game is littered with a lot of them. I don\u2019t complicate it. I just say the same things Walter Smith said or Graeme Souness did. I bet, if you compared the three team talks, there wouldn\u2019t be many differences.\u201dRangers (4-3-3):McGregor; Tavernier, Goldson, Worrall, Flanagan; Coulibaly, Jack; Candeias, Morelos, Kent. Spartak Moscow (4-2-3-1): Maksimenko; Rasskazov, Dzhikiya, Bocchetti, Kombarov; Fernando, Zobnin; Hanni, Eremenko, Lomovitskiy; Ze Luis. Referee: Kevin Blom (Holland). Kick-off: 8pm.
