{"id": "\nEngland in the dark over importance of South Africa victory but support echoes Lord's day of glory\n", "paragraph": "Had England faltered against South Africa on Friday, it would have virtually guaranteed that they would have been flying home at the end of the group stage \u2013 not that all of everyone involved realised this fact when taking the field, including the player of the match.\u201cYeah, that was news to me after the game,\u201d said Nat Sciver in the aftermath of her brilliant figures of three for four, which she agrees is the best she has bowled for England. \u201cIt is a massive relief,\u201d she continued. \u201cA lot of the team didn\u2019t know that we needed to win \u2013 I didn\u2019t!\u201dAfter easily chasing down the paltry 86 they required for victory, England can rest easy in the knowledge that they will feature in the semi-finals in Antigua next week, going through from Pool A with the West Indies, who they play on Sunday to complete the group stage.The performance of England\u2019s bowlers was dubbed as \u201cclose to perfect\u201d by Anya Shrubsole, who claimed a hat-trick to finish off the Proteas.For Sciver\u2019s part, she is thrilled to have been given the chance to take a leading role with the ball, even if it is at the expense of the injured Katherine Brunt, a long-term symbolic leader of the side.At the previous major tournament \u2013 when England won the World Cup \u2013 it was Sciver\u2019s coming of age as a dominant international batter, belting two centuries before compiling a critical half-century in the Lord\u2019s decider.\u201cIt was brilliant to put in that kind of performance and to bowl the first over,\u201d she said of her now equally-important second discipline.Sciver drew a comparison with that famous day at headquarters in terms of the support the team are receiving from their vocal friends and family section at Darren Sammy Stadium.\u201cThey have got some good moves,\u201d she said of the dancing that has been a constant feature of the in-ground broadcast. \u201cWalking off the pitch last night at the halfway stage after Anya had taken a hat-trick was probably the best atmosphere we\u2019ve had since Lord\u2019s so they are doing a great job for us and hopefully they can put on a show for us on Sunday as well.\u201dThe equation is simple for England: if they beat the West Indies and top the pool they will play Australia next Thursday in the semi-final. If they lose, they will instead come up against India, who have passed through their group stage fixtures undefeated. \u201cWe had a tri-series against both of them in India earlier this year so we have played each other quite a lot,\u201d a relaxed Sciver said. \u201cSo we know what we are going to come up against.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
