{"id": "\nMoores the merrier as Baron Alco gets off to flying start\n", "paragraph": "Ryan Moore may have had a quieter year on the Flat than he has been accustomed to in recent seasons, but his father, Gary, and brother, Jamie, got their jump season off to a flyer when Baron Alco made all the running to win the BetVictor Gold Cup, the first major prize of the winter, at Prestbury Park on Saturday.It was a smart training performance on behalf of Moore to bring the seven-year-old back from a suspensory injury sustained at this course when a game second at the Festival in March 2017.Having resisted running him at the back-end of last season, he brought him back after 577 days at Chepstow five weeks ago. A bold ride from Jamie, who had noticed frontrunners doing well at this meeting, did the rest.He would not have been aware of the drama taking place behind him. Nine of the 18 starters came back without jockeys, with two down at the first and two at the last. The top weight, Frodon, who had been handy most of the way, too, just lost a length or two from the third last and, though he rallied up the hill, Baron Alco kept him at bay to win by two lengths.Guitar Pete, winner of the December equivalent of this race last year, was third with Mister Whitaker, the 6-1 favourite, fourth, having never really been able to get into the race.\u201cI nearly took him out because I thought the ground was quick enough for him,\u201d said the trainer, who did withdraw his other runner Benatar afterwards. \u201cBut the owners persuaded me to run, and luckily they talked more sense than me. But it\u2019s testament to the horse and everyone at home who has worked on getting him back. He and Jamie are made for each other.\u201dJohn Stone, whose silks he carried, has owned horses for 30 years but never enjoyed a success quite on this scale. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to bits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. I couldn\u2019t believe it would happen. He jumped like a stag.\u201dThe jockey praised the horse\u2019s attitude. \u201cHe\u2019s very genuine,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make all the running here, but I\u2019d seen a few do it this weekend. Dad\u2019s a mustard trainer \u2013 flat horses, jump horses, it doesn\u2019t matter. He can train anything. He\u2019s had winners at Royal Ascot and he\u2019ll have winners at Lingfield and Kempton all winter. He\u2019s going to win the Grand National next with Traffic Fluide.\u201dThe National is very much the target for Rock The Kasbah after the eight-year-old beat Royal Vacation and the 2015 Gold Cup winner Coneygree in the BetVictor Handicap Chase a length and a quarter and five lengths.\u201cHe\u2019s the right type for it,\u201d said Hobbs, who has twice been a runner-up in the Aintree spectacular.The sight of top weight Coneygree leading to the third last was heartening after he had pulled up on both starts last season. \u201cHe got tired but he had every right to,\u201d explained trainer Sara Bradstock.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
