{"id": "\nTrainer Uriah St Lewis and bargain buy Discreet Lover - tale of two long shots for the Breeders Cup Classic\n", "paragraph": "Uriah St Lewis and Sir Michael Stoute have a couple of things in common; they were both born in the West Indies and love cricket, but even though they are both racehorse trainers that is about where the similarities end.If Stoute is a multiple Group One-winning trainer in a career spanning 45 years with a soft spot for the Breeders\u2019 Cup, where he has won seven races, St Lewis and his family work seven days a week a lot closer to racing\u2019s bargain basement end.He trains 20 of his own horses, usually bought as yearlings for under $20,000 (\u00a315,750) and often a broodmare\u2019s first foal, at Parx, in Pennsylvania, and until Tuesday had never been to Churchill Downs let alone the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\u201cWow, I thought when I arrived at 5am yesterday morning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hit me. Every trainer should experience this. The lights were on and there were\u00a0already 5,000 people there. At Parx we race in the dark and they don\u2019t get 5,000 people there even when there\u2019s racing on!\u201d \u00a0On Saturday, though they are not in the same race, the paths of the two trainers will finally cross\u00a0 when St Lewis, 60, saddles Discreet Lover in the most open $6\u2009million (\u00a34.7\u2009million) Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in recent times and despite the five-year-old being 40-1 with Coral, he looks the best long-shot of the meeting this weekend.He gained his entry in the race by beating Godolphin\u2019s Thunder Snow in the Jockey Club Stakes, at\u00a0 Belmont last month, to provide\u00a0 St Lewis with his first victory in a Grade One race. And, if the run of Mendelssohn in third that day reaffirmed Ballydoyle\u2019s belief that their colt could win the Classic, then victory did no less for\u00a0 St Lewis\u2019s confidence in the horse that cost him just $10,000 (\u00a37,870) as a yearling.\u00a0\u201cA lot of good horses fall through the crack,\u201d explained St Lewis when we spoke at the track On Tuesday\u00a0morning. \u201cYou just have to be patient with them. He was a bit on the small side, maybe, but sometimes horses are big and robust with no sense. He has a lot of sense.\"In the Jockey Club Stakes even the commentator called the horse the wrong name until, as St Lewis recalls, \u201cthe last jump\u201d when he crossed the line.\u00a0\u201cWe had our eye on the Breeders\u2019 Cup for a long time but we wouldn\u2019t have come if he hadn\u2019t have won a win-and-you\u2019re-in race,\u201d explained. St Lewis. \u201cI\u2019m operating on my own. I\u2019m not going to take $115,000 [\u00a390,000, the cost of entry], which I have won, and put it back in.\u201cLast year was his breakout year but we kept coming up against Gun Runner. He was beaten 14 lengths by him twice and though it sounds like a lot, Gun Runner was beating everything by seven and eight lengths. Take him out of the equation and we\u2019re in business.\u00a0\u201cIn his races, we take him back and come with one run, which was ideal at Belmont. They set off like a sprint and I thought \u2018You gonna keep going faster?\u2019 and they did. I\u2019m expecting first, second or third\u00a0in the Classic.\u201dSt Lewis was first taken to a racecourse in Trinidad aged five.\u00a0\u201cI saw a grey horse and fell in love,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI moved to America aged 15 and used to do track and field at school, which was two miles from Aqueduct. I\u2019d run to the track, make a daily double, then run back. I would look in the paper the next day and if it had come up I\u2019d run back there to collect.\u201dWhen he started work it was fixing computers, but for the American Tote at the track and the lure of the sport proved irresistible. \u201cI had my first runner in 1987 and have been up, down, up, down, up and down ever since.\u201dOn Saturday the \u2018up\u2019 could be off the scale but win, lose or draw\u00a0 St Lewis is determined to enjoy it. \u201cI know I\u2019m unlikely to get another like this one,\u201d he reflected.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
