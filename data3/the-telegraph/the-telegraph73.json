{"id": "\nChelsea's match-winner Alvaro\u00a0Morata can still improve, insists\u00a0Maurizio Sarri\n", "paragraph": "\nFollow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis\nMaurizio Sarri has backed \u201cfragile\u201d \u00c1lvaro\u00a0Morata to keep improving after the striker scored two goals in Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace.Morata has now scored five goals in his last six games, but should have finished the game with the matchball after squandering a late chance to secure his hat-trick.Chelsea\u2019s \u00a357 million record signing has struggled to justify his price tag since joining from Real Madrid last summer and head coach Sarri believes confidence has been an issue.\u201cHe's a little bit fragile,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cFrom the mental point of view. But he's very young. I think he can improve, improve very fast.\u201dAsked if his recent run would improve Morata\u2019s belief, Sarri replied: \u201cI think so. \u00c1lvaro\u00a0improved during the last month. Improved for the confidence, improved for the personality, improved also from the technical point of view. Now he's able to play more with the team, I think. But I think, also, that \u00c1lvaro\u00a0has a very great physical and technical potential, so I think he can improve more.\u201dMorata only trails Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane by a single goal in the Premier League and is level with last season\u2019s top scorer Mohamed Salah.On the subject of whether the 26-year-old can keep up with the Premier League\u2019s most lethal strikers, Sarri said: \u201cI don't know. But for \u00c1lvaro, the goal has to be a consequence. He has to play for the team, with his mates, without thinking about goals. Goals are usually consequence of teamwork.\u201c\u00c1lvaro\u00a0is very fast. Not in the first two or three steps, but if he has to run for 40m he's very fast. He has great potential.\u201dPedro was also on the scoresheet against Palace and the result meant that Sarri equalled Frank Clark\u2019s Premier League record of not losing any of his first 11 games in charge.\u201cI am really very proud, but I am very proud to be the coach of this team,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cThe record is not one of the coach, but of the team. I was lucky. I have very good players and my players, in the last two months, were able to win also without a great level of organisation from the tactical point of view. I was lucky, I think.\u201dPalace have not won in six Premier League matches, but manager Roy Hodgson said: \u201cIt doesn't really matter where you are at Christmas. We were rarely outside the relegation zone last season, but ended up 11th. We've missed chances, yes, and been a bit unlucky, yes. We don't have as many points as we should have, yes. But let's see where we are after 38 games. It's important to keep going irrespective of what happens in the next few games.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
