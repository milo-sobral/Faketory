{"id": "\nEverton stadium move will not take place until 2023-24 at the earliest\n", "paragraph": "\nFollow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis\nEverton will wait at least another 12 months before submitting a planning application for a new \u00a3500 million stadium after starting a one-year public consultation process.A move to Bramley-Moore Dock will not happen until at least the beginning of the 2023-24 season - a year later than former chief executive Robert Elstone originally suggested.The club is also re-evaluating earlier plans to partially fund the construction with a \u00a3250m loan secured by Liverpool City Council. The Merseyside club\u2019s preference is to privately finance the entire project and they are in talks with investors.Everton say the consultations starting in November \u2013 which they have described as \u2018The People\u2019s Project\u2019 \u2013 are designed to address community concerns regarding the site and impact of a new stadium and the legacy for Goodison Park following relocation. No designs have yet been made public and the timescale for completion has shifted.Speaking at last January\u2019s AGM, ex-chief executive Elstone said the club was optimistic of an earlier finishing point.\u201cWe hope it will take a year to secure funding and planning, and to conclude designs, and then three years to build on what is a complex site,\u201d he said.\u201cIf all goes to plan, we hope to be kicking-off at Bramley-Moore Dock in August 2022.\u201dEverton say that date was always aspirational rather than fixed as they manoeuvre through the complex planning process.The club\u2019s current chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale, who took over from Elstone last summer, says a stadium will assist areas of Liverpool in need of regeneration.Among those supporting Everton\u2019s proposals on the dockside and Goodison Park is former deputy prime minister and environment secretary Michael Heseltine, widely credited with assisting the rejuvenation of Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock in the 1980s.Everton say their plans can have a similarly transformative effect in the north docks.\u201cThis consultation marks a very significant moment as we progress with this project,\u201d said Barrett-Baxendale.\u201cWe would like as many people as possible \u2013 and not just football fans \u2013 to take part and let us know their views.\u201cOur ambition is not just to create a new home for a very proud and historic football club but also a new landmark stadium, in an iconic setting, which will deliver huge regeneration benefits for the whole of the Liverpool City Region.\u201cEverton is committed to delivering an authentic football stadium which responds to Liverpool\u2019s World Heritage Site designation. The plans we are developing will respect the historic features of the site and complement its surroundings.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
