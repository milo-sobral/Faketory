One student made the point that \u201cwe\u2019re inviting them into our home and we can\u2019t invite people who stand against our values\u201d.The debate was consultative, but the college\u2019s governing body will make its final decision next week.The move is understood to be driven by LGBT students who say they wouldn\u2019t feel so welcome at the college gave a platform to people who are openly homophobic.There is a perceived physical threat because of the organisation's alleged history of harassment in protesting outside abortion clinics.The camp is supposed to take place next summer, before term starts but no fixed date has been set. Although the vast majority of students will not be at the college, some will be on site doing research projects. There are also around 60 postgraduates who live permanently on site.In a statement to The OxStu, an Oxford student newspaper, a JCR spokesperson said: \u201cThe JCR met to discuss, and passed a motion that they opposed the group coming. However, until a decision is made, it would not be appropriate to comment further\u201d.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
