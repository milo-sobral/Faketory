Ahead of Monday night\u2019s\u00a0 defeat by Manchester City, he\u00a0 admitted to reaching his lowest point at Tottenham following delays over the stadium and a failure to sign any players during the summer transfer window.Having failed to finish the stadium in time for the initial opening date of Sept 15, Tottenham had been tentatively working towards completing it in time for the Burnley game on Dec 15.But chairman Daniel Levy last week confirmed the stadium will not be ready for that date and that Spurs will finish the year playing at Wembley, where 56,854 fans \u2013 below the 90,000 capacity \u2013 watched the defeat by City on a pitch ruined by the NFL match between Jacksonville Jaguars and Philadelphia Eagles the previous day.That has led to suggestions that the Manchester United game on\u00a0 Jan 13 could be a new target, but construction experts have told\u00a0 Telegraph Sport\u00a0that February is a more realistic move-in date.Tottenham have a number of electrical issues to resolve and the sheer scale of the work still left, along with the Christmas and new-year break, make it difficult to complete in time for the visit of United.Pochettino\u2019s team have two home league fixtures in February, against Newcastle United, on Feb 2, and Leicester City seven days later.Pochettino has made it clear that he expects to be given big money to spend when Tottenham eventually move into their new stadium, but the club last week revealed their net debt is now worth up to \u00a3637\u2005million. An extra \u00a3237\u2005million has been borrowed to help cover the spiralling bills of the stadium, which is likely to cost over \u00a31\u2005billion when finished, and Spurs are ready to finance their debt through a bond issue.Gary Neville believes Pochettino has started to plot his exit strategy, telling Sky Sports\u2019 Monday Night Football: \u201cHe is a brilliant coach, but at some point he was always going to want to manage one of the super-clubs in Europe.\u201cThere are a couple at the moment that you can imagine will be changing manager in the next 12 months and looking at him, and he will know they are looking at him.\u201cIt feels to me that he has laid the first foundations for a move away from the club and started to prepare the ground.\u201dHaving already lost to City, this could be a defining week for\u00a0 Tottenham\u2019s season with a Carabao Cup tie against West Ham United tonight, a trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday and the\u00a0vital Champions League visit of PSV Eindhoven next Tuesday night.With Pochettino considering changing his entire team for the trip to West Ham, the midfielder Harry Winks has described Spurs\u2019 schedule \u201cridiculous\u201d. Christian Eriksen and Alli could both start at the London Stadium after coming off the bench against City.Pochettino said: \u201cIt is so difficult, it is not easy. We are going to assess all the players and it is less than 48 hours to compete again, having had the circumstance of playing on a pitch that is so difficult to play in a tough and a very competitive game.\u201cWe\u2019ll see which players can repeat, some can be on the bench and some they need to rest. My feeling today is that it is going to be difficult to repeat some players, maybe [Eric] Dier who played 65 minutes, but I don\u2019t believe too many players will be ready and fresh to play.\u201dWinks added: \u201cWe have got three games in five days which is ridiculous really, in terms of the schedule. So it is going to be tough for us.\u201cWe have got to dig in, we have got a big squad, got players that can play two games in two days because we are a fit squad and a fit bunch of players.\u201dDespite fears over Pochettino\u2019s future and the immediate fixture schedule, Alli is optimistic about his and Tottenham\u2019s fortunes after signing his new contract. \u201cI\u2019ve loved my time at Spurs so far,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see what the future holds.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
