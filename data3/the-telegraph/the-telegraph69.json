{"id": "\nWorkers 'should be forced to have pay docked to pay for care in old age'\u00a0\n", "paragraph": "Workers should be forced to have their pay docked, and equity from pensioners\u2019 homes taken to cover the cost of care in later life, the former head of the country's health watchdog has said.Sir David Behan, who recently stood down from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), urged ministers to be brave in their forthcoming green paper on social care.The issue almost cost Theresa May the last election, with proposals to tackle the issue dropped after being dubbed a \"dementia tax\". \u00a0In an interview with The\u00a0 Telegraph, Sir David pressed ministers to introduce measures to use \u00a0the \u201cwealth\u201d of baby boomers - whether in the form of their homes, savings or pensions, to pay towards their care.And he said such changes should be accompanied by a compulsory system of social insurance for those of working age, in order to build up funds for the future.Such charges would be taken from pay packets on top of national insurance, contributing to a national care fund to pay towards care in old age.A proposal for mandatory insurance in understood to be one of six options currently under consideration for the Government's social care green paper, which is due to be published next month.Failure to introduce such measures\u00a0 would result in \u201ca long steady decline\u201d of the care system, with growing numbers denied any help, the former watchdog chief said.\u201cGovernment in my view has not been brave enough in making the decision to reform the system,\u201d he said, urging ministers to look to other countries which have taken such steps.\u201cIf you look at Japan and Germany they\u2019ve reformed their system,\u201d he said. \u201cOther Governments are responding to this issue.\u201dOver the last two decades, both countries have introduced mandatory insurance for workers.Sir David urged ministers to introduce similar measures, warning that voluntary schemes were unlikely to work.The Health Secretary recently floated the idea of an \u201cauto-enrolment\u201d scheme for care, with pay docked to fund future care unless a person opts out. Other ideas under consideration include a \u00a0\u201ccare Isa\u201d where unspent funds would be exempt from inheritance tax.But Sir David suggested that optional schemes might leave too many people deciding to \u201ctake their chances\u201d in the hope they never needed care.\u201cThe most effective way to plan for this is by having a big risk pool. \u00a0If you make a political choice that its voluntary then the size of your risk pool is lower,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn my personal view, there should be compulsory insurance.\u201dSir David 63, left CQC in July after 40 years working in social services and health, and has just taken up a role as a non-executive director for HC-One, Britain\u2019s largest care home operator.In the first interview since he stepped down, the former official said attempts to provide care for a rapidly ageing population should also make more use of the \u201cwealth\u201d tied up in pensioners\u2019 homes, instead of expecting them to be passed on to future generations. \u00a0\u201cI think the older generation need to be able to make a contribution towards their care costs.\u00a0You have to have things like equity release,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThose of us that have wealth, whether that is through pension or equity should make a contribution to the cost of care,\u201d Sir David said, urging politicians and the public to be \u201cmore open-minded\u201d.Funding needed to come from current workers, and those past retirement age, in the interests of \u201cintergenerational fairness\u201d he said.Measures to dock workers\u2019 pay should allow the younger generation some time to \u201caccumulate their assets and get on the housing ladder\u201d the former official said, highlighting the system in in Japan, where premiums begin to be taken from the age of 40.Without radical action and substantial funding, the situation facing Britain\u2019s elderly could become intolerable, he suggested, with think tanks suggesting that more than \u00a34bn a year extra is required.\u201cOver the next 20 years the number of people aged over 85 is set to double. Quite frankly, the supply of care is not keeping pace with demand,\u201d he said, with research suggesting that one in seven pensioners who need help to wash, dress or get out of bed do not receive it.\u201cWe risk a long steady decline,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe demand for care is going to increase, you will have more people not getting the support they require, more pressure on the NHS, more families under pressure; this is not a tolerable system for a civilized society.\u201dSir David said warring between the major parties meant serious proposals were too often \u201cdismissed out of hand\u201d - describing attacks on Theresa May\u2019s dementia tax as \u201cretaliation\u201d for previous Tory criticism of Labour\u2019s social care plans.And he raised fears that ministers would end up fudging decisions, if they were not prepared to show leadership.\u201cIn 1948, with the creation of the NHS, Bevan did that in the face of opposition from both consultants and GPs. It was controversial, and it was a brave decision by the government of the day.\u201cWe need a similarly brave decision to reform the system of social care today; if we keep waiting for a consensus, we will not see the changes we need,\u201d he said.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
