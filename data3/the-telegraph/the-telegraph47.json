They helped the Rams beat Manchester United on penalties at Old Trafford in the last round of the Carabao Cup.Loanees are not allowed to play against their parent clubs in Premier League matches since a change in the rules after Lomana LuaLua scored a late equaliser for Portsmouth against Newcastle United in 2004.There is no such restriction in the Champions League and Chelsea failed in a bid to have goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stopped from playing against them for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the semi-finals in 2014.Carabao Cup rules allow parent clubs to decide whether or not loanees can play against them, but assistant-manager Zola claimed the influence of Lampard, the leading goalscorer in Chelsea\u2019s history, had not been decisive.Asked if 19-year-old Mount and 20-year-old Tomori can play because of the strength of feeling towards Lampard, Zola said: \u201cNo, it's not only that. I can tell you it's not that.\u201cIt is because we believe that, by playing against us, there is an opportunity for Mason and Tomori to grow up quicker.\u201cThe more they play against Premier League teams the more experience they get and we can make better evaluations on them. It was a great opportunity to see them play in front of us and we took the opportunity.\u201cThere will be a lot at stake. It will be a game on a higher level to the ones they play in their own league, but there will also be a psychological component. They will have to play in front of a big crowd, the crowd of the team they belong to. It will give them a good test.\u201dWhile Lampard has claimed he will not go wild if Derby manage to pull off another shock, Mount and Tomori have been given permission to celebrate a goal or victory.\u201cIt\u2019s down to them,\u201d said Zola. \u201cBut why not? Hopefully they won't celebrate too much!\u201dZola, though, warned there is no guarantee that Chelsea\u2019s other loanees will be allowed to play against their parent club, saying: \u201cIt's important to see the two players playing to give good indications for us. But in the future it does not mean we will keep doing that.\u201dMeanwhile, Chelsea coach Marco Ianni has been fined \u00a36,000 after admitting his improper conduct charge from\u00a0the Football Association.Ianni was handed the punishment for his furious bust-up with Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge earlier this month.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
