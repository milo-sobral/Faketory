Magnanimous Howe said: \u201cWe were lucky to get through because they missed some good chances. There were not too many positives from us.\u201cIt is a good thing to be able to win and not play well. Last year and the years before we have only won when we have played really well.\u201dHowe made eight changes to the team which swept aside Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage on Saturday to maintain their scintillating start to the league season.The home side did not show much of their quality, with Junior Stanislas\u2019 excellent opening goal\u00a0 six minutes before half-time the\u00a0 notable exception. He demonstrated superb close control to bring down Jermain Defoe\u2019s pass on his chest before producing a neat step-over and shooting unerringly into the roof of the net.Norwich striker Dennis Srbeny was unlucky not to equalise when his shot struck the inside of a post before the Championship side\u00a0 conjured a deserved equaliser 20 minutes remaining.Onel Hernandez went unnoticed by the Bournemouth defence as\u00a0 he crept in at the far post before placing his shot beyond Artur Boruc and into the net after Tom Trybull had scooped a majestic pass over the top.The visiting side\u2019s joy lasted only three minutes, however, before centre-back Cook produced the type of finish any striker would have been proud of through a crowded penalty area after going up to meet a corner.Substitute Jordan Rhodes should have levelled for a second time in the dying seconds but could not make the most of a free header.Farke praised his players. \u201cOur performance was outstanding and we deserved much more. We should have won,\u201d he said.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
