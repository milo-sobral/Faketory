He is known for his forthright interviewing style, and bosses are said to have reminded him that he needed to take a sensitive approach when reporting a tragedy.One of those killed was Mr Srivaddhanaprabha\u2019s personal assistant, Nusara Suknamai. Roan was apparently referring to her when he was unwittingly recorded in the background of a Sky News feed, unaware that the cameras were still rolling and the footage was being streamed live online.Roan appeared to laugh as he alleged that the club owner had a \u201cmistress who died in the crash, otherwise known as a member of staff, ie. the mistress,\u201d adding wryly that the business tycoon was a \u201cfamily man\u201d.He went on: \u201cBut that\u2019s what you do if you\u2019re a billionaire - that\u2019s expected, so we shouldn\u2019t judge.\u201dMiss Suknamai was a former beauty queen and actress who had worked for Mr Srivaddhanaprabha for several years. Another employee, Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died in the crash.The footage, taken at the King Power stadium shortly after Mr Srivaddhanaprabha\u2019s widow laid a wreath, was watched by thousands of Leicester City fans and was soon circulated on social media.Roan issued a short apology, tweeting: \u201cJust want to say sorry for some comments made in private, off-air conversation earlier with a colleague. Absolutely no offence intended.\u201dMany fans replied calling for him to resign and accusing him of disrespecting Mr Srivaddhaprabha\u2019s memory with his \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d comments.Roan believing himself to be off-air was no defence, they said, pointing out that Andy Gray and Richard Keys lost their jobs as Sky Sports pundits in 2011 after they were overheard making derogatory comments about a woman.The corporation refused to confirm that Roan would face disciplinary action, saying: \u201cWe deal with staff matters privately.\u201dA BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThis was an ill-judged comment made in a private off-air conversation for which Dan has apologised.\u201dBut a source said: \u201cThe BBC have taken a dim view of this. They told him at the outset that the main thing he needed to do was to strike the right tone, and then this happens.\u201dA Cambridge graduate, Roan joined the BBC trainee scheme and worked for a spell at Sky and Setanta before returning to the corporation. He was made sports editor in 2014 and admitted that his appointment raised eyebrows.\u201cWhen I was made editor, the people who I\u2019d worked with before could not believe this was possible,\u201d he told Varsity magazine.Roan was banned from the Etihad stadium in 2012 over his \u201cleading and aggressive\u201d questioning of Patrick Vieira. He also clashed with Sir Alex Ferguson, saying the former Manchester United manager was \u201cnot used to journalists standing up to him [but] it\u2019s what makes the job fun\u201d.\u00a0\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
