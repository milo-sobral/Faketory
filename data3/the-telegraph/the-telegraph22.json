We hope it will be OK and we can play like we normally do.\"I prefer to play than be on the sidelines, that's for sure. I've worked hard to get back as quickly as possible and then you try to get back with the rhythm of the team.\u201cIt went well with the injury. There were not a lot of complications. I've worked hard to be back and I'm happy to be here.\u201cThe team have done well without me. Obviously, most were games that we should have won, but we've done really well. We\u2019ve only lost to Lyon, so we've been fine. But, to be honest, I didn't expect anything less.\u201cThese games, though, are the most important ones. We have to go and show our intent to stay at the top. Tottenham will try to do the same because they are close [to us in the table]. It's a big one.\u201dGuardiola described his team\u2019s dismantling of Shakhtar as one of the best performances he has seen during his time in Manchester and there are worrying signs for the rest of the Premier League that City could be even better this season than they were when winning the title by a record 19 points.The performance on Tuesday night will also have caught the attention of the main Champions League contenders.\u201cI think they were already wary of us,\u201d De Bruyne added. \u201cWe have\u00a0one player more than we had last season, but I don't know if we are better equipped to win the Champions League. There are about 10 teams who can win it.\u201cLast year was so good, it's hard to say we are playing even better now, but the beginning to this season has been really good.\u201dSergio Aguero will return to the starting line up against Spurs after he was replaced by Gabriel Jesus against Shakhtar, although John Stones may have to continue at right-back as Kyle Walker is still easing his way back to fitness.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
