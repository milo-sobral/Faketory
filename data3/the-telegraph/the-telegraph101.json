A win of any kind against Israel at Hampden on Tuesday night will secure a play-off place for the 2020 European Championships.McLeish said: \u201cThis win gives us a fantastic fillip ahead of a game against a decent team. We have a job on our hands but the players should take a lot of confidence from tonight.\u201dHamburg defender David Bates, a late call-up, was handed his debut in an attacking line-up. He partnered Scott McKenna, with Cardiff attacker Callum Paterson in at right-back. Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Fletcher was asked to lead the line, supported by Forrest and Fraser. The Bournemouth winger\u2019s goal came when he took a pass from midfielder Christie, turned on to his right foot inside the box and curled the ball past keeper Etrit Berisha.However, when Mavraj was dismissed for putting his head on Christie, when play was stopped for the captain\u2019s foul on Forrest \u2013 he was shown a yellow then a red \u2013 the game had turned Scotland\u2019s way.Albania manager Christian Panucci replaced Ergys Kace with Ardian Ismajli in a reshuffle. But, seconds before the interval, after Christie had been fouled by Ismajli, Scotland doubled their lead. Stuart Armstrong\u2019s free-kick was judged to have hit the hands of Rey Manaj \u2013 perhaps fortuitously for McLeish\u2019s men \u2013 and Fletcher sent Berisha the wrong way with his spot-kick.Ten minutes into the second half, Forrest raced through the middle on to a Christie pass and beat Berisha with a right-footed drive.The next goal came after 67 minutes when Fraser set up Forrest to skip past defender Frederic Veseli and volley in from 12 yards.Albania\u00a0(3-5-2) Berisha; Mavraj, Djimsiti (Dermaku 53), Veseli; Binaku, Memushaj, Xhaka, Kace (Ismajli 27), Uzuni; Grezda, Manaj (Balaj 62).\u00a0 Booked\u00a0Manaj, Mavraj, Grezda.\u00a0 Sent off\u00a0Mavraj (22).\u00a0Scotland\u00a0(4-4-2) A McGregor (Rangers); Paterson (Cardiff), McKenna (Aberdeen), Bates (Hamburg), Robertson (Liverpool); Armstrong (Southampton), C McGregor (Celtic), Christie (Celtic), Forrest (Celtic); Fletcher (Sheffield Wednesday), Fraser (Bournemouth).
