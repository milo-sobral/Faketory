{"id": "\nFrank Lampard's rampant Derby blow away sloppy West Brom\n", "paragraph": "West Bromwich Albion missed a chance to regain top place in the Championship as they fell to a\u00a0second defeat in as many matches as Derby established the right to be seen as promotion contenders.\u00a0An attacking Derby line-up hit two goals in the opening 15 minutes and never relinquished control, adding two more in the second half to quash any possibility of a comeback by the home side. Albion\u2019s cause was not helped by an injury to top scorer Dwight Gayle, who took his place on the field for the second half after taking a knock late in the first period but withdrew before the referee had re-started.\u00a0Gayle thought he should have had a penalty just before half-time when Derby\u2019s Scott Malone\u00a0appeared to clip his heel but replays were inconclusive.\u00a0Derby manager Frank Lampard set up with five attacking players, but the opening goal was a gift. Jack Marriott intercepted a limp backpass by Jay Rodriguez after 10\u00a0minutes to score easily.\u00a0Derby pressed for a quick second goal and were rewarded five minutes later as Craig Dawson allowed Tom Lawrence to cut inside him on the left and send a shot wide of Sam Johnstone and in at the far post.\u00a0Albion were not without chances but could not match Derby\u2019s finishing and when Harry Wilson, on loan from Liverpool, added a third six minutes into the second half with a crisp left-foot strike from 20 yards the game was over, even before Malone cashed in on more sloppy defending by Dawson to fire in a fourth 19 minutes from the end.\u00a0Rodriguez combined with Harvey Barnes with seven minutes left to deny the visitors a clean sheet.\u00a0West Bromwich Albion (4-3-1-2): Johnstone; Dawson, Adarabioyo, Bartley, Gibbs (Mears 45); Phillips (Morrison 62), Field, Brunt; Barnes; Gayle (Robson-Kanu), Rodriguez.
