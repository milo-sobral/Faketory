{"id": "\nDele Alli has high hopes for England: 'Our aim is to be recognised as the No 1 team in the world'\n", "paragraph": "Even if England beat Croatia at Wembley on Sunday and reach next year\u2019s Nations League finals, it will not be enough for Dele Alli.The Tottenham midfielder is aiming far higher and has given a revealing insight into the new mentality around the England camp under Gareth Southgate.\u201cOur aim is to be recognised as the No\u20091 team in the world. It is going to be a difficult challenge, but we believe in ourselves, and we believe in the talent and the manager we\u2019ve got here,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we really want to put a time limit on it, but as a national team, that is our end goal.\u201cWe genuinely believe we can achieve it, and I think that\u2019s the main thing. We had a good World Cup, reaching the semi-finals, but didn\u2019t win it. There were a lot of positives to take, and we knew it was a massive step for us as a nation as well. But there\u2019s a lot to improve on, and we know it.\u201dThis refreshing, mature approach epitomises the new England under Southgate, and the feel-good factor generated from the World Cup has carried over into this season for Alli.He has endured a frustrating campaign at club level, picking up a few irritating injuries, but recently signed a new five-year deal and proved against the United States that he remains a key player at international level.It is easy to forget that he is only 22 and has already experienced many highs and lows since making his debut under Roy Hodgson in October 2015.That infamous, nightmarish defeat against Iceland at Euro 2016 remains vivid in the mind, with Southgate sitting his squad down to watch it unfold before flying out for the World Cup. Many of those players involved were probably hiding behind the sofa.\u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d seen it because I had just wanted to pretend I wasn\u2019t even there,\u201d says Alli.\u201cFor some of us, it was our first tournament for England. You have such high hopes, you go there with all that self-belief \u2013 and then something like that happens which you don\u2019t expect. You just want the floor to open and eat you up. You just want to hide forever.\u201cIt was difficult [watching it] and everyone was very quiet when it was on \u2013 nobody was talking. But it definitely improved us, and I think it helped everyone.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t really talk about it, but we don\u2019t look back on it with such anger now.\u201dIs Alli confident England would now be better equipped to deal with an Iceland situation?\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d definitely say so,\u201d he insists. \u201cThe big thing about that game was the mental side. When they took the lead, we all sort of froze. It was almost as if we didn\u2019t have another plan. We didn\u2019t expect it. It was like, \u2018What do we do now?\u2019, and nobody had an answer. So, we\u2019ve done a lot of work [on mentality]. I\u2019d say now that the work we\u2019ve been doing has been preparing for situations like that, so that we don\u2019t panic.\u201dEngland\u2019s resolve will undoubtedly be tested on Sunday against Croatia, in another revenge mission against the team which ended their World Cup dream.A second victory in four days would take England to next June\u2019s finals and guarantee a place at Euro 2020.The last visit of Croatia to Wembley ended in misery and defeat, a night defined by torrential rain and Steve McClaren\u2019s brolly, but there is a confidence in this emerging England squad that makes you believe anything is possible.Alli believes new boy Jadon Sancho, the Borussia Dortmund winger, is further proof of the young talent Southgate has at his disposal.\u201cHe has got a big future ahead of him,\u201d says Alli. \u201cHe\u2019s a real talent, and I think it\u2019s all down to him. He\u2019s got to keep his head and keep working hard. From what I\u2019ve seen of him so far, he seems to be doing that. I\u2019ve seen his clips in the Bundesliga, and working with him here, you can see his talent. It\u2019s exciting for England.\u201dIndeed, Sancho\u2019s raw ability and street-footballer reputation probably reminds Alli of his teenage years in Milton Keynes before his big move to Tottenham three years ago. Those formative days are never far from his thoughts.\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to go and play in the park any more, but I still have a kickabout with my mates every now and then, more in the off-season. I don\u2019t want to get injured playing there,\u201d he says with a smile.\u201cI don\u2019t really get to go back too much because of the fixtures we have. I don\u2019t want to be driving too far, but I\u2019ve definitely got the same spirit.\u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t changed. I want to stay true to who I am. Milton Keynes is a big part of that.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
