The sanction also included a restriction on the size of the club's squad for Europe the following two seasons and limits on their transfer spending and wage bill.In a statement issued at the time, the club suggested they were minded to fight UEFA in the courts but had decided to reluctantly accept the punishment in the interests of their fans, partners and commercial operations.And three years later, two thirds of that fine, more than \u00a333million, was reimbursed to City by UEFA for meeting the terms of the 2014 settlement.Rival clubs could have appealed against City's 2014 sanction, or the similar punishment Paris St Germain received at the same time, but none did and, so far, none has called for new sanctions now.UEFA, however, is already investigating PSG's finances again, although the French club have challenged that decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, while Spain's La Liga has asked UEFA to look again at City's books as well.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
