The first goal he scored was a genius little link-up play by Shaq,\u201d said Klopp.\u201cIf you work hard, are in the right spaces, if your teammates see you and you make the right runs, you will score. It\u2019s an exceptional number, hopefully he can continue. What\u2019s the next record he can reach?\u201dAlthough Belgrade fans were banned from Anfield, a few hundred did make it into the stadium and jeered Shaqiri.Shaqiri was born in the former Yugoslav city of Gjilan, now part of Kosovo, and also has Albanian roots. Although\u00a0Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Serbia will not recognise it as a state.Red Star officials say they will protect Shaqiri from \u2018unwanted situations\u2019 when Liverpool travel to the country on November 6. When Shaqiri scored against Serbia in the World Cup, he celebrated with an \u2018Albanian eagle\u2019 gesture.Klopp says he has not given any thought to omitting him from the return game in a fortnight to avoid tensions.\u201cSo far, I didn\u2019t think about it, to be honest. It makes sense that I first think before I speak,\u201d said Klopp.With PSG and Napoli playing out a 2-2 draw, Liverpool returned to the top of their group but it remains tight.\u201cWe are not through yet,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cThis group obviously stays exciting until the end, that was pretty clear I thought immediately after the draw. But we cannot do more than winning our own games, and then the situation can change in your favour. That happened tonight, but it doesn\u2019t say too much about the group to be honest.\u201cThe Champions League is very difficult, you have to be 100 per cent focused. They all strike back, they all come back, so I expect a very difficult game in Belgrade to be honest. With the supporters there and all that stuff, it will be really difficult. Napoli have already experienced that.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
