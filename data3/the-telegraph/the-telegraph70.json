{"id": "\nTheresa May will lead the Conservative Party into the next election, predicts former Daily Mail editor\n", "paragraph": "Paul Dacre, the former editor of The Daily Mail, has predicted that Theresa May will lead the Conservative Party into the next election as part of an excoriating attack on \u201cthe metropolitan echo chamber\u201d.Mr Dacre said that a false consensus in Westminster had decided that \u201cBrexit is doomed and that the terminally incompetent Theresa May is toast\u201d.He added: \u201cShe is, of course, still here and will, I predict, take the Tories into the next election.\u201d\u201cThe problem with the echo chamber is that its inhabitants increasingly haven\u2019t a clue what real people in Britain, outside the M25, are thinking.\u201dMr Dacre, who stepped down as editor of Britain\u2019s biggest mid-market newspaper in August after 26 years, was speaking in Manchester at the Society of Editors conference. His successor, Geordie Greig, has taken a softer line on Brexit, urging Conservative MPs to back Mrs May\u2019s Chequers proposals.Mr Dacre defended his coverage of Brexit, including a front-page attack on High Court judges in 2016 that branded the \u201cenemies of the people\u201d for a ruling that the Government would need parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50.He said: \u201cThe Mail should have the freedom to write a headline about judges being the enemy of the people.\u201cThe title of an Ibsen play, it was meant to be a distillation of the views of Brexit MPs angry that the High Court was becoming involved in the political process. In retrospect, The Telegraph\u2019s banner \u2018the judges versus the people\u2019 was, to coin a phrase, a tad more judicious. But what the hell. The point needed to be made.\u201cAnd I just hope that their Lordships\u2019 bruised feelings are soothed by the \u00a360,000 pay rise they are in line to collect.\u201dHe highlighted the injunction recent granted to Sir Philip Green against The Telegraph as an example of the rich and powerful \"still being aided and abetted by a judiciary that, sadly, doesn\u2019t seem to understand the pure silliness of granting gagging injunctions in a digital age\u201d.Mr Dacre, 69, also predicted that the BBC will diminish in power as US streaming providers undermine the licence fee, and that one day Britain will host a \u201cright-of-centre TV network\u201d. He backed calls for Silicon Valley giants Google and Facebook to be regulated and said that the \"ultimate solution - as with the oil barons in the last century - is to break them up\u201d.\u201cTheir monopolistic power is too great and that fundamental human characteristic - the need for privacy against the the industrial-scale theft of our data - will reassert itself,\u201d Mr Dacre said.Newspapers will have a longer future than many predict, he added, and \u2018authentic, regulated, curated journalism, both online and print\u201d will prevail over material served up by algorithms.Mr Dacre, who was awarded the Society of Editors\u2019 first lifetime achievement award, also renewed a long-running feud with Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of The Guardian.He attacked what he said was \u201ccloying self-glorification\u201d and \u201cmoral superiority\u201d in Mr Rusbridger\u2019s recent book on journalism, and accused his rival of a \u201csomewhat chilling lack of self-awareness\u201d. Mr Dacre criticised the \u201cmadness\u201d of Mr Rusbridger\u2019s expansion into America with \u201cno plausible business of journalistic model\u201d and praised efforts by his successor Katharine Viner to bring spending under control.\u00a0He concluded: \u201cSo there. I\u2019ve stuck my neck out and indeed, with The Guardian, put it on the block. Well, frankly, my dears, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
