It got picked up by a few people and I spoke to the headmaster about it on the phone.\u201cHe asked me to take it down because it is defamatory towards the school and that he would have to speak to the data protection officer if she refused.\u201cI was disappointed, because you\u2019d think a teacher would have a sense of pride in what they are doing. Things like this actually damage a child\u2019s education.\u201dIt was unclear who had set the crossword, but it is understood that they have been spoken to by senior staff at the school.Last night, Mr Williams told the Telegraph: \u201cThe academy accepts that the homework provided did include some errors.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhilst this is an unfortunate and regrettable incident, it has been appropriately addressed and the school shall continue to support learning at home.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
