But now at the moment, Petr Cech will start the Blackpool match after coming back from his injury.\u201dEmery added that he will select a \u201cmix\u201d of youngsters and first-team players against Blackpool, who are currently 12th in League One.Arsenal will be without full-back Hector Beller\u00edn, who is also a doubt for this weekend\u2019s meeting with Liverpool after picking up a thigh injury against Palace.There may be returns to action for left-backs Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac, who have both suffered minor hamstring injuries. Both players will be assessed ahead of Wednesday\u2019s game.\u201cWe respect Blackpool, and we will take the responsibility to have the best performance in each competition so that we are able to win the match,\u201d said Emery.\u201cWe will choose 18 players for the Blackpool match, the young players also. We are going to have a mix in order to get the best performance against Blackpool, to respect them.\u201cFor us the Carabao Cup is very important. It is an opportunity to win a trophy and for tomorrow, a chance to play in front of our supporters at Emirates Stadium in this competition.\u201d\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
