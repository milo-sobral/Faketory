He previously worked for Arsenal after getting his coaching qualifications while still a taxi driver.Responding to a witness who said he was at the march, Phillips reportedly posted: \u201cI was too. The football fans were sticking to the agreed route and Antifa chose to confront the march. They had their\u00a0face covered up. We didn\u2019t.
