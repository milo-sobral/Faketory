{"id": "\nNigel Clough's Burton end former club's League Cup ambitions by reaching quarter-finals for first time\n", "paragraph": "Burton 3-2 Nottingham Forest\u00a0Nigel Clough continued his love affair with the League Cup as his Burton Albion side reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history and ended his former club Nottingham Forest\u2019s hopes of recreating some of their glory days in the competition.Forest were hot favourites to reach their first quarter-final for 25 years after knocking out Newcastle United and Stoke City in previous rounds but were stunned by three second-half goals by the underdogs.Burton missed a first-half penalty but went two goals up inside the first 18 minutes of the second period as Scott Fraser saw one shot deflected past Forest goalkeeper Luke Steele and then buried a second.Lewis Grabban pulled one back to raise Forest\u2019s hopes of a fightback but then a stunning volley by Jake Hesketh eight minutes from the end effectively sealed a famous win for the League One side, even though Arvin Appiah, an England Under-17 striker making his senior Forest debut, scored a second for the visitors in stoppage time.Clough, twice a League Cup winner as a player with Forest and a semi-finalist as a manager with Sheffield United, lost to Manchester United in a money-spinning third-round away tie last season but wants a home quarter-final from Wednesday\u2019s draw after seeing off Aston Villa, Burnley and now Forest at the Pirelli Stadium.\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have nights like this, especially after dropping out of the Championship,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re making up for it in the League Cup and though the chairman might think differently from a footballing point of view I\u2019d want to be at home again.\u201dForest made 10 changes from the side that drew at Leeds last Saturday but manager Aitor Karanka, who had never previously lost a cup tie to a League One side, said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by their performance.\u201cBurton were more hungry than we were and I can\u2019t explain that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the chance for a first quarter-final for 25 years yet we did not look like we wanted it.\u201dBurton, who had gone further than previously in the competition to reach this stage, had some luck six minutes into the second half when a 20-yard shot by Fraser looped into the net via a deflection off defender Saidy Janko, the score going down as an own goal.Fraser then doubled their lead when sloppy defending from the Championship side enabled Boyce to set him free on the left to curl a clean strike past Steele 12 minutes later.Forest substitute Grabban pulled one back 20 minutes from time with his ninth goal in his last 10 appearances, but any chance that Karanka would be spared an embarrassing night disappeared when Boyce found Hesketh with a cross to the far post and the forward\u2019s volley gave Steele no chance.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
