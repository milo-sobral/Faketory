He killed himself three weeks later at his Birmingham home on October 9.The 49-year-old former infantryman is believed to be the 48th former or serving serviceman or woman to take their own lives this year.His wife, Jo Jukes, 47, has written to Jackie Doyle-Price, the new suicide prevention minister, urging her to address the failings in mental health services for veterans.Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, she said: \u201cMy husband was asked to serve his country but was then abandoned and repeatedly let down by mental health agencies. How many times does someone need to ask to be sectioned before something is done?\u201cI don\u2019t think the NHS understands the symptoms of combat PTSD, which can result in them appearing resistant to treatment, at times due to their ingrained military persona which can appear aggressive and erratic.\u201dHer letter catalogues how she and her two daughters struggled to cope with a \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d character suffering nightmares, paranoid episodes and who could be potentially violent or withdrawn.She wrote \u201cit is absurd that we as a society can create killers and then dump them without the correct support.\u201dListing her repeated failed attempts to get him sectioned, she adds: \u201cAll such failures have directly led to David ending his life in abject despair which has now destroyed a family.\u201dShe warned how the mental health \u201ccrisis\u201d facing veterans was out of control, adding: \u201cIt is the prime responsibility of the Government to get its act together and get a grip on this and lead from the front.\u201dThe Sunday Telegraph can reveal that three weeks before his suicide, Mr Jukes, who joined the Army in 1991, wrote to the NHS\u2019s Veterans\u2019 Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service (TILS) saying: \u201cI seem to be getting worse and it\u2019s starting to worry me\u2026 I think I need to be put away for a time before I lose it and do something I don\u2019t mean to.\u201cAnd it will give the ones I love a break\u2026 I\u2019ve never had to fight myself this much before and it\u2019s hurting me. All I want to do is never wake up and let them be happy.\u201dWhen Mrs Dukes followed up that email because her husband was clearly suicidal she was advised by the unit to call 111, an NHS line for non-threatening emergencies.A spokeswoman for Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust which runs the TILS service assigned to Mr Jukes said it will \u201cinvestigate all of the circumstances surrounding his death.\u201dWhile Mr Jukes accepts her husband was \u201cvery difficult\u201d for medics, police, and veterans\u2019 associations to cope with, his problems stemmed from feelings of guilt and memories from his service.\u201cHe told me he felt guilty about what he had done, what he had seen and what haunted him. When ill he was not the man I married eight years ago,\u201d she added.Stephen James, of All Call Signs which helps veterans experiencing mental issues, said they were dealing with similar cases \u201ctime and time again\u201d.\u201cWe are fearful of further loss of life. The mental health services available to veterans are so fragmented and difficult to navigate that it\u2019s almost impossible to know where to turn in a crisis.\u201cUntil the government takes responsibility and provides a single point of contact for veterans seeking help, we\u2019re going to keep losing our nation\u2019s heroes to hidden wounds.\u201dMrs Jukes and All Call Signs want the Government to make coroners record the numbers of veterans who kill themselves to monitor the scale of the problem.A Department of Health spokeswoman said since 2010 the Government had provided an extra \u00a322.5 million to treat mental and physical health needs of veterans, with an extra \u00a39 million injected for early treatment.\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions\npage."}
