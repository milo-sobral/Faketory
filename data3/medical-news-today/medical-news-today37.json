These include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobia-related conditions.Estimates for 2015 from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that anxiety disorders affect 3.6 percent of the global population and that this figure varies among countries. In the United States, the prevalence is around 6.3 percent.The recent study is not the first to investigate the calming effects of linalool, notes co-author Dr. Hideki Kashiwadani, of the Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences at Kagoshima University.\"However,\" Dr. Kashiwadani reports, \"the sites of action of linalool were usually not addressed in these studies.\"The prevailing assumption was that inhaling linalool led to it being absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream, it could then reach signal-sensing proteins called gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors in nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Benzodiazepines also target these receptors.Dr. Kashiwadani and his colleagues used various experiments involving, for example, a \"light/dark box\" and an \"elevated plus maze,\" to test the effect of exposure to linalool vapor in normal mice.They saw that the compound exerted \"an anxiolytic effect without motor impairment.\" This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and injected linalool, which impair movement in a similar way to consumed alcohol.Exposing mice that lacked a sense of smell to the compound did not produce the same effect, thus confirming that \"olfactory input\" was the route to the brain.In addition, when the scientists pretreated the normal mice with the drug flumazenil before allowing them to smell the linalool vapor, the animals showed no reduction in anxiety. Flumazenil blocks the GABAA receptors that respond to benzodiazepine.\"When combined,\" Dr. Kashiwadani notes, \"these results suggest that linalool does not act directly on GABAA receptors like benzodiazepines do \u2014 but must activate them via olfactory neurons in the nose in order to produce its relaxing effects.\"He says that further research is now needed to test the safety and effectiveness of linalool, and to find out the exact sites in the brain that the compound targets.As well as being a potential relaxant for people about to undergo surgery, the compound could also offer an alternative for those who struggle with \"oral or suppository administration of anxiolytics, such as infants or confused elders,\" Dr. Kashiwadani adds.\"Our study also opens the possibility that relaxation seen in mice fed or injected with linalool could in fact be due to the smell of the compound emitted in their exhaled breath.\"Dr. Hideki KashiwadaniYour privacy is important to us.Healthline Media UK Ltd, Brighton, UK.\u00a9 2004-2018 All rights reserved.
