However, this may be limited to shorter and less severe periods of anxiety.Doctors recommend several exercises and techniques to cope with brief or focused bouts of anxiety, including:Standard treatment for anxiety involves psychological counseling and therapy.This might include psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or a combination of therapy and counseling.CBT aims to recognize and alter the harmful thought patterns that can trigger an anxiety disorder and troublesome feelings, limit distorted thinking, and change the scale and intensity of reactions to stressors.This helps people manage the way their body and mind react to certain triggers.Psychotherapy is another treatment that involves talking with a trained mental health professional and working to the root of an anxiety disorder.Sessions might explore the triggers of anxiety and possible coping mechanisms.Several types of medication can support the treatment of an anxiety disorder.Other medicines might help control some of the physical and mental symptoms. These include:Tricyclics: This is a class of drugs that have demonstrated helpful effects on most anxiety disorders other than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These drugs are known to cause side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and weight gain. Two examples of tricyclics are imipramine and clomipramine.Benzodiazepines: These are only available on prescription, but they can be highly addictive and would rarely be a first-line medication. These drugs tend not to cause many side effects, except for drowsiness and possible dependency. Diazepam, or Valium, is an example of a common benzodiazepine for people with anxiety.\nAnti-depressants: While people most commonly use anti-depressants to manage depression, they also feature in the treatment of many anxiety disorders. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are one option, and they have fewer side effects than older anti-depressants. They are still likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction at the outset of treatment. Some types include fluoxetine and citalopram.Other medications that can reduce anxiety include:Stopping some medications, especially anti-depressants, can cause withdrawal symptoms, including brain zaps. These are painful jolts in the head that feel like shocks of electricity.An individual planning to adjust their approach to treating anxiety disorders after a long period of taking anti-depressants should consult their doctor about how best to move away from medications.If severe, adverse, or unexpected effects occur after taking any prescribed medications, be sure to update a physician.Although anxious feelings will always be present in daily life, there are ways to reduce the risk of a full-blown anxiety disorder.Taking the following steps will help keep anxious emotions in check and prevent the development of a disorder, including:Treating an anxiety disorder focuses on psychological therapy, medication, and lifestyle adjustments. Treatment will be different for each person depending on the type of anxiety disorder they have and the presence of any underlying conditions.Self-management is the first step for managing anxious feelings and often involves relaxation techniques, an active lifestyle, and effective time management. If these measures do not bring anxious reactions under control, visit a doctor and seek other avenues of treatment.If anxious reactions are severe from the outset, for example taking the form of panic attacks, seek treatment.Psychological therapies, including CBT, can help a person adjust the way they react to stressful life events and triggers, as well as the scale of the reaction. They can also help to limit distorted thinking and replace negative thoughts.Medications that can support treatment include tricyclic medications, anti-depressants, beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines. Speak to a doctor about any severe side effects or withdrawal symptoms after stopping.
