So far, these studies can only show that there is a relationship between the two conditions.Despite this, Itzhaki believes that the data so far supports the case of using antiviral drugs to deter Alzheimer's.\"Considering that over 150 publications strongly support an HSV1 role in Alzheimer's,\" she says, \"these Taiwan findings greatly justify usage of antiherpes antivirals \u2014 which are safe and well-tolerated \u2014 to treat Alzheimer's disease.\"\"They also incentivize the development of an HSV1 vaccine, which would likely be the most effective treatment,\" the researcher adds.Itzhaki says she would like to now study dementia rates among people who have mild HSV1 or mild genital herpes because the findings from the studies based on the Taiwanese data only examine the link between dementia and severe HSV1 and chickenpox infections.Your privacy is important to us.Healthline Media UK Ltd, Brighton, UK.\u00a9 2004-2018 All rights reserved.
