These tests indicate the presence of cancerous cells in the body and the extent to which these cells have spread.Some of these tests include:Biopsy: This involves taking a sample of tissue from a potentially cancerous lesion and sending it to a laboratory. A pathologist who specializes in diagnostic techniques will then examine the cells for signs of cancer.A biopsy sometimes involves using a needle to remove cells, but a doctor might use a surgical procedure in instances where a larger area requires examination.Imaging scans: These help a doctor identify cancerous lesions in the body. Examples of imaging studies include a CT, ultrasound, or MRI scan. Imaging machines have different methods of creating images and may be more sensitive to certain types of cancer, such as cancers of the soft tissue or bones.A doctor may order more than one imaging scan for this reason.Laboratory testing: Cancerous cells release compounds into the blood. A doctor may take samples of blood, urine, sputum, or other body fluids to check for these compounds. Lab tests are rarely a primary method for diagnosing cancer. However, they can be important for ruling out other conditions and confirming a diagnosis.A doctor will usually work with a team of specialists to diagnose cancer, including a radiologist and pathologist.Doctors classify cancer using the site at which the cancer started or the type of tissue where the cancer originated.For example, a person can have breast cancer, which is usually a type of carcinoma, or cancer that arises from epithelial tissue. This is a type of tissue that forms a particular layer of the skin.Examples of cancer classifications by tissue type include:Carcinoma: This develops in epithelial tissues, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract or mucous membranes. According to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated 80 to 90 percent of cancer cases are carcinomas.Each type of cancer cell has a distinctive appearance that helps a doctor distinguish it from other cancers. Knowing the classification of cancer can help a doctor develop an effective plan for treatment.\nMore than 100 cancer types can occur. As a result, cancer causes a variety of symptoms depending upon the type.Some cancers might not cause symptoms until reaching a more advanced stage, which is why early detection methods, such as skin cancer checks and mammograms, are recommended.Cancer symptoms usually create changes in the body that do not relate to a specific or identifiable cause. A person might incorrectly dismiss these as age-related changes when they indicate an early symptom of cancer.Examples include:While cancer can cause pain, it is not usually an early symptom of cancer.Seek a medical opinion if experiencing any of these symptoms without knowing the cause.Cancer is often a dangerous condition, as cancer cells use up vital resources and space that would otherwise support other systems and functions.Cancer cells use up oxygen, blood, and energy stores. Tumors that form from cancer cells can lead to the creation of new blood vessels, diverting blood flow. Cancer also compromises the immune system, reducing a person's ability to fight other illnesses and diseases.In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death.However, cancer is by no means always fatal, and developments in treatment have led to vastly improved survival rates and longer periods spent without cancer.After receiving a cancer diagnosis, people often worry about the next steps and the likelihood of their cancer being dangerous.Doctors use a system called staging to help determine a person's cancer prognosis and outlook. Staging takes into account many factors that determine the progression of cancer, such as tumor size and spread.By using a consistent staging system, doctors across the world can understand more about cancer simply by knowing the stage.Several factors come into consideration when staging a tumor, such as:Doctors use this information and place it into the TNM staging system. The components of the system are:T, for tumor: Doctors consider the size and extent of the main or primary tumor.N, for number: This refers to the number of lymph nodes that also show signs of having cancerous cells. A higher number of lymph nodes with cancer cells will mean a more advanced stage.M, for metastasis: Doctors consider if the cancer cells have spread to other body parts.An example of a tumor staging using this system could be T1N0MX. This means the primary tumor is identified, there is no cancer in the lymph nodes, and the doctor cannot measure the spread, or metastasis, of the cancer.The TNM system can be very detailed. Another staging method a doctor might use for some cancers ranges from 0 to IV.These stages mean:Additional staging systems exist, and a doctor may use them based on conventions in the location of their practice and the type of cancer.Staging is an important part of defining the outlook for a person with cancer but does not provide the full picture of how likely that person is to survive.A doctor will also consider other factors, including:When a doctor discusses the outlook with the person who has cancer, they might explain survival rates in various terms. Examples of these terms may include:None of these are absolutes. Some people survive longer than their predicted outlook, while others do not.Diagnosing cancer in the early stages is vital for improving the chances of survival.A doctor might use a biopsy, imaging scan, or blood test to confirm cancer. If cancer is present, they will then decide on the categorization and stage of it to determine how severe it is and shape the course of treatment.Receiving a cancer diagnosis can be devastating. Taking the time to talk with a doctor and fully understand treatment options and prognosis can help a person move forward and make decisions about treatment.Never ignore potential cancer symptoms. A person should talk with their doctor if they have observed any worrisome symptoms that are unexplained or persistent.I have just received a diagnosis of cancer with a very poor outlook. What next?Receiving a diagnosis of advanced cancer may be overwhelming and distressing. It\u2019s important to talk with your doctor in detail about your specific diagnosis and treatment options to fully understand your prognosis.You can also get a second opinion to help you decide how to move forward with treatment or palliative care. It\u2019s important to reach out for support from family and friends, and it may help to bring someone to support you at doctor visits.
