An estimated 2 percent of people with RA will also experience gout.Doctors can treat both conditions, but it is important that people receive the correct diagnosis to determine the most appropriate treatment.RA is an autoimmune inflammatory condition.It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the synovial tissues or linings of the joints.This reaction causes inflammation, pain, and swelling. It usually occurs in the hands, wrists, ankles, and knees on both sides of the body.Over time, repeated bouts of swelling can lead to joint damage.Gout is also an inflammatory disorder, but it is not an autoimmune condition. Instead, a person with gout develops high levels of uric acid in their blood.Uric acid is present in foods and drinks, and taking certain medications can also increase the amount of uric acid in the body.These uric acid crystals can deposit in the synovial tissues, especially in the hands, feet, and elbows.RA affects more women than men. An estimated 1.5 million people in the United States have RA, and the condition affects almost three times as many women as men.On the other hand, gout affects more men than women. An estimated 4 percent of American adults, or about 6 million men and 2 million women, have gout.Some symptoms of RA and gout are different, including the areas affected and the long-term effects.Doctors do not associate gout with causing the range of long-term problems that RA can, such as heart and respiratory diseases.A person with RA will experience bouts when their symptoms are worse and periods where symptoms reduce or disappear. Doctors call these flares and remissions.During the early flares of RA, symptoms may include:RA can lead to progressive and long-term complications, even with medicines. Long-term effects of RA include:Similarly to an RA flare, people may get periodic attacks of gout that come and go. People experience an attack of gout or acute gout when excess uric acid crystals deposit in the joints.Gout often occurs after a trigger, such as drinking too much alcohol, which increases the quantity of uric acid crystals in the body.Symptoms of gout in the joints may include:The joint most commonly affected by gout is the big toe. Gout does not usually affect multiple joints in the earlier stages, during an acute flare-up.People can also experience gout in their ankles, fingers, elbows, or wrists.Gout does not usually cause the same autoimmune reactions as RA, such as fever and brain fog.RA is caused by problems with a person's immune system, though doctors do not know why this occurs in some people and not others.Individuals with the following risk factors are more likely to experience RA than others:Gout occurs when a person's body builds up excess amounts of uric acid. Some people naturally produce excess uric acid, which can make gout more likely.People with the following risk factors are more likely to experience uric acid build-up, or gout, such as:In severe cases, people can experience chronic gout. This involves frequent gout attacks and joint damage. With treatment, a person can often manage their gout symptoms before the chronic effects occur.To diagnose RA or gout, a doctor will start by taking a person's medical history and symptoms. They will ask about their diet, any medications they take, and any other chronic conditions.A doctor will also conduct a physical exam and consider where a person is experiencing their symptoms. For example, if a person has gout, they will likely have pain in their big toe.A doctor will also organize blood testing. If a person has gout, their uric acid levels will usually be high. A doctor may order other blood tests to check for properties that are also frequently high in people with RA, including:Doctors may order imaging tests, such as X-ray and MRI scans, to check for possible damage to soft tissue or bone.Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation around the joints that could resemble RA.A doctor may use a needle to remove fluid from the swollen joint to test for the presence of uric acid crystals that may indicate gout.Correctly identifying RA versus gout is important because the treatments are different.Treatments for gout include:People may be able to slow or halt the progression of RA by taking medications that reduce inflammation in the body and slow the immune response that contributes to the inflammation.RA treatments include:A person may need to try several different medications before finding the ones that best manage their condition.Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and stopping smoking, may also help to slow the progression of RA.RA and gout are both forms of arthritis or arthritides, but they cause different symptoms and have different long-term effects and treatments.Gout is usually related to lifestyle, such as diet, and inflammation frequently occurs in the big toe. In contrast, RA usually causes pain in the hands, wrists, and ankles.Each condition causes changes in the blood that a doctor can detect. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are vital because each condition has different underlying causes and treatments.
