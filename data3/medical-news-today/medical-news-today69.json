Likewise, an older person tends to have more body fat than a younger person with an equal BMI.For these reasons, BMI may not give the detail necessary to determine whether a person's weight is healthful.BMI does not reflect the location or amount of body fat, and these factors can impact health.For example, studies have indicated that people who have fat around the waist and surrounding the abdominal organs may be more at risk of health problems than those with fat in other areas.A 5-year investigation of 1,964 people, published in Scientific Reports in 2017, was one study that confirmed these findings.If a person has a high BMI, they are likely to have a high proportion of body fat, especially if their BMI falls in the obesity category.However, it is possible to be \"overweight\" according to BMI, but have healthful levels of fat.For extremely muscular people, such as athletes and bodybuilders, height and weight measurements alone may not accurately indicate health, because muscle weighs more than fat.A healthy, muscular person may have a BMI in a very high range. Meanwhile, a frail, inactive person may have a low BMI, but more body fat and less lean tissue than is healthful.Regular BMI cannot accurately indicate the state of a person's health at some stages in life.These include:For this reason, BMI calculations are different for children and teens. These measurements take age and sex into account.Norm can also vary among people of certain races and ethnicities.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) suggest that an assessment of weight and health risks should incorporate three key measures:If fat accumulates around the waist rather than the hips, a person may have a higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.This risk increases with a waist size greater than 35 inches for non-pregnant women or greater than 40 inches for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).To measure their waist, a person should:The following information, adapted from the NHLBI, may help indicate the risks associated with BMI and waist circumference.The chart shows weight categories according to BMI, and the effects of higher waist circumference on the risks of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.WaistWaistMen 40 inches or lessWomen 35 inches or lessMen: 40 inches or moreWomen: 35 inches or moreA doctor may also measure body fat composition.\nBeing overweight or having obesity can increase the risk to the heart.The following issues can also increase the risk of developing heart disease, for example.A doctor will recommend that a person consider losing weight if they:If a person has obesity or excess weight plus two or more risk factors, they may be at risk of a number of obesity-related health problems in the future.Losing 5\u201310 percent of their current weight can reduce the risk of developing these health problems.Some people are overweight but have no other risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. They should follow a healthful and varied diet, and get regular exercise to prevent additional weight gain.
