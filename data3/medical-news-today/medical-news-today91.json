The study paper is now available in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society (ACS).In their study, the research team analyzed data collected from 52,438 women with ages between 40 and 69. Some of these participants opted to receive breast cancer screening over a 39-year period, in 1977\u20132015, in Dalarna, Sweden.To improve the assessment of how organized breast screening initiatives would impact health outcomes, the experts who conducted the recent study used a new method that involved calculating the annual incidence of breast cancers leading to death within 10 years and within 20 years following diagnosis.The investigators found that the women who had joined an organized breast cancer screening program had a 60 percent lower risk of death within 10 years following breast cancer diagnosis. They also had a 47 percent lower risk of death within 20 years after breast cancer diagnosis.All the participants who were diagnosed with breast cancer, the investigators note, received the appropriate treatment for the cancer stage they were experiencing, in line with the most recent national guidelines at that time.The researchers believe that screening allows specialists to detect cancer tumors at an early stage, which means the tumors can be treated sooner, and they will respond better to therapy.\"Recent improvements in treatments have led to reduced deaths from breast cancer,\" says senior study author Prof. Stephen Duffy, from Queen Mary University of London.\"However, these new results demonstrate the vital role that screening also has to play, giving women a much greater benefit from modern treatments. We need to ensure that participation in breast screening programs improves, especially in socio-economically deprived areas.\"\nProf. Stephen Duffy\"Our results, from precise, individual\u2010based data covering 6 decades, should provide women and their physicians with reassurance that participating in regular, high\u2010quality mammography screening is the best way to reduce the risk of a premature death from breast cancer,\" the study authors conclude in the published paper.They also note that the research received support from the ACS.Your privacy is important to us.Healthline Media UK Ltd, Brighton, UK.\u00a9 2004-2018 All rights reserved.
