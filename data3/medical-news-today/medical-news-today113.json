They appear for a few weeks during a flare and then ease or disappear for a while.There are many different types of psoriasis, including plaque psoriasis, nail, scalp, guttate, inverse, erythrodermic, and pustular psoriasis. Psoriasis can also lead to a number of complications.Read on to find out more about how to recognize some of the types of psoriasis.A person with plaque psoriasis is likely to experience the following:Inverse psoriasis tends to appear in skin folds, and it is more common among people who have excess weight.Nail psoriasis affects the finger and toenails. It may happen with plaque or another type of psoriasis.If symptoms are severe, it can become hard to use the hands and feet, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.Here are some of the features.People with psoriatic arthritis can experience nail changes if the arthritis affects their fingers.The changes can look like the signs of a fungal infection. Sometimes there is a fungal infection, known as onychomycosis, but this is not always the case. Sometimes a bacterial infection can result in the skin folds around the nail.This is sometimes known as teardrop psoriasis or raindrop psoriasis. Lesions appear on the skin, but they look different from those in plaque psoriasis.Guttate psoriasis usually occurs after a strep throat infection, and it is more common among teenagers and children. It may disappear and not come back, but some people eventually develop plaque psoriasis.Scalp psoriasis can occur alone or together with plaque psoriasis.This is less common than the other kinds of psoriasis.There are three main types, and they affect different areas of the body. In pustular psoriasis, the lesions contain pus, which is made up of white blood cells.This type affects the hands and feet. It may happen alone or alongside another type of psoriasis.The following can happen:This is the least common form of psoriasis, but it can be life-threatening if the person does not receive treatment.Other symptoms include:If a person develops a red, fiery rash across the skin, it is important to seek urgent medical treatment. The complications of erythrodermic psoriasis can be serious.Some people with psoriasis also develop a type of arthritis, known as psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Most people develop psoriasis first, but sometimes the arthritis develops before the skin lesions appear.The symptoms of PsA include:PsA can affect the eyes:Iritis, or inflammation of the iris, can occur. The eye becomes red, and there may be sensitivity to light.Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris and other parts of the eye. Symptoms include redness of the eye, blurred vision, unusual sensitivity to light, and eye pain.Apart from the joints, PsA can sometimes affect the spine. Also known as spondylitis, this involves:Symptoms may include pain and stiffness in the lower back, upper buttock area, neck, and the rest of the spine.Symptoms are usually worse on waking up or after long periods of inactivity.\nPsoriasis is a condition that probably affects between 2 and 2.6 percent of people in the United States. It is not a contagious disease, but it can be uncomfortable. It can also lead to depression, anxiety, stress, and a reduced quality of life.As it is a systemic condition, a number of complications can also develop.However, treatment can relieve symptoms and reduce the chance of a flare.Anyone who experiences unusual skin, nail, or joint changes should see a doctor, who will be able to prescribe medication and offer advice.
