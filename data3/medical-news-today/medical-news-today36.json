We also cover some tips for preventing colds.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of people develop the common cold each year in the United States alone. On average, adults get two or three colds a year.Many viruses can cause the common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause and are responsible for more than half of all colds and cold-like illnesses.Rhinovirus infections typically result in mild cold-like symptoms. However, rhinoviruses can also cause more severe illnesses, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, in people with weakened immune systems.Rhinoviruses typically spread through:Once inhaled, the rhinovirus attaches itself to the cells inside the nasal passages. It then begins to replicate itself, spreading more virus particles throughout the upper respiratory tract.Some research suggests that rhinoviruses may replicate more efficiently at temperatures lower than 37\u00b0C, or 98.6\u00b0F, which is the average core body temperature in humans. The temperature inside the nasal cavity is approximately 33\u00b0C (91.4\u00b0F), which may make it an ideal breeding ground for rhinoviruses.Most research on rhinoviruses has primarily focused on examining how differences in body temperature affect the virus's ability to reproduce. However, more recent research is focusing on environmental factors that may increase a person's risk of developing a rhinovirus infection.One study examined whether or not variations in temperatures and humidity led to a higher risk of rhinovirus infection. The researchers found that decreases in both temperature and humidity over a 3-day period increased the risk of rhinovirus infections in participants.In the same study, researchers found that the majority of infections occurred in temperatures at zero (32\u00b0F) and below.Influenza viruses, which cause the flu, may also survive and spread more easily in cold and dry air. One study in guinea pigs suggests that the ideal temperature for the influenza virus to spread is 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).Many researchers believe that exposure to cold weather can adversely affect a person's immune response, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. Reasons for this may include:Some ways to avoid getting sick during the winter include:Viruses, such as rhinoviruses and influenza, cause colds and the flu, not the weather. However, exposure to cold weather can increase a person's risk of contracting a virus.Research suggests that these viruses may survive and reproduce more effectively at colder temperatures, making it easier for them to spread and infect more people. Cold weather may also reduce the immune response and make it harder for the body to fight off germs.
