In this article, we take a closer look at these two conditions.Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, which is when something goes wrong with the body's immune system. Psoriasis occurs when the body produces skin cells faster than usual, causing thick, scaly patches of skin to appear.Keratosis pilaris is a harmless skin condition. It occurs when there is a buildup of keratin in the skin. Keratin is the protein found in hair, skin, and nails.The extra keratin builds up in the hair follicles, causing small bumps to form. The bumps are usually red, white, or skin-colored, and resemble goose bumps.Doctors are unsure what causes the excess keratin to form. One study suggests that coiled hair shafts under the skin could be what causes keratosis pilaris.People can have both psoriasis and keratosis pilaris, but researchers do not know whether the two skin conditions are linked.Both psoriasis and keratosis pilaris tend to run in families.

Neither skin condition is contagious or infectious.Apart from these similarities, psoriasis and keratosis are different skin conditions.Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis.

Among the most effective moisturizers for keratosis pilaris are ones that contain urea or lactic acid.People can develop different types of psoriasis, which all have different symptoms. On the other hand, keratosis pilaris always appears as small bumps on the surface of the skin.Sometimes, people may confuse keratosis pilaris for guttate psoriasis or pustular psoriasis, which also cause small bumps on the skin.This type of psoriasis usually appears very suddenly and is usually linked to people having an infection, such as strep throat.Symptoms of guttate psoriasis include:Guttate psoriasis is usually temporary and can disappear within weeks or months without any treatment.Pustular psoriasis causes patches of skin redness with small, pus-filled bumps. It usually appears on the hands and feet. This condition is not contagious.These areas of skin tend to be very painful and swollen. Brown dots and scale may appear as the bumps dry out.Severe cases of pustular psoriasis happen when pus-filled bumps cover most of the skin and break open. Medical attention is necessary in these cases, as severe pustular psoriasis can be life-threatening.Inverse psoriasis, also called intertriginous or flexural psoriasis, develops in areas where skin touches skin, such as armpits, buttocks, and genitals.This form of psoriasis causes smooth, painful patches of red, raw-looking skin and does not always involve a silvery-white skin coating, as in plaque psoriasis.If people have psoriasis, they should check their fingernails and toenails for the following symptoms of nail psoriasis:People with nail psoriasis should see their dermatologist for treatment, which can help prevent the condition from worsening.A dermatologist will be able to diagnose psoriasis and keratosis pilaris.
