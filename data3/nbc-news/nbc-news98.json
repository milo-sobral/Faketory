{"id": "Scared to run alone? Women runners share their best safety tips", "paragraph": "I used to like to run by myself in the evening, away from the busy streets and bright lights. Then, one night I was followed by a group of men. Fortunately I made it home unscathed, but my appetite for solo jogs was spoiled after that. I guess it was the last straw. I was already exhausted by the aggressive male behavior I had to endure: catcalling, heckling and lewd propositioning.These disturbing incidents were random, uncontrollable and at times terrifying. I\u2019ve known so many women who can relate, and now I know even more after researching this article.None of these women succumb to fear. They recognize that they can\u2019t control what others do, that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201casking for it\u201d, and that you can take all the safety precautions in the world and still end up a victim. But they don\u2019t give up what they love, an attitude that inspires me to get my sneakers back on and go for it, with some handy tips in mind.Part of what helps women runners stay confident is taking safety precautions. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re guaranteeing their safety (that\u2019s not possible), or that anyone who has been hurt or worse while running could have been spared had they taken more precautions (that\u2019s victim-blaming).What it does mean is that they\u2019re having better, less stressful workouts by practicing risk-aversion.\u201cIt is probably smart for women to have a certain level of risk aversion while they run because they are vulnerable targets to predators,\u201d says Laura Dugan, Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland. \u201cWith risk aversion, they can make decisions that will reduce their vulnerability and consequently allow them to enjoy their running.\u201dHere\u2019s how to practice risk-aversion when running alone as a woman:\u201cPredators will [typically] only attack when nobody else is around,\u201d says Dugan. \u201cWhile it might be nice to run in the woods, perhaps [women] can choose to run in a more popular park where others will be around. Also, women should avoid running at night.\u201dLauren Crain, a woman runner, has a firm policy around this.\u201cIf I'm running on a path, and I don't see anyone else for more than five minutes, I never run on that path anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel a lot safer when there are other runners or bikers around, and if I don't see anyone for more than five minutes, I'll usually turn around and go back.\u201dIf you\u2019re new to an area, and not sure where to run, Tina Willis, a personal injury attorney and avid distance runner for nearly 20 years, recommends asking neighbors and even dropping by your local police station to learn what trails local officers recommend.Also, given her expertise in personal injury law, Willis stresses to not forget about another serious threat to all runners: drivers.\u201cI cannot overstate the importance of staying off road shoulders, especially really narrow or non-existent ones,\u201d she says.So, choose an area populated by people, not cars.\u201cOne important thing I have changed in my running routine is that unless I am around a lot of people or running on the boardwalk during the day, I no longer put headphones on,\u201d says Christie Maruka, a fitness enthusiast who runs/speed walks daily. \u201cHeadphones playing music [is distracting] and I would zone out listening, and [thus be unable to] hear if someone is coming up behind me or at me. As much as I enjoy running to music it\u2019s really not safe.\u201dCrain makes a compromise.\u201cWhen I go running, I wear my broken headphones,\u201d she says. \u201cThe right earbud doesn't work, so I can still be aware of my surroundings.\u201dAt night, Crain ditches the earbuds altogether, feeling that the mere appearance of them make her appear like she\u2019s not aware of her surroundings, \u201cso I want to limit that view of me especially when it's semi-dark outside.\u201dMaruka also keeps her keys in her hand as a ready weapon, while many other women (myself included when I\u2019m walking the dogs alone at night) carry pepper spray or another weapon.This may help you feel safer, but Dugar discourages women from carrying weapons \u201cunless they are well trained on how to use them. This includes pepper spray and knives.\u201dDugar\u2019s reasoning is mainly that your weapons can actually be used against you by an attacker. Moreover, she points out, pepper spray expires, so if you are trained to use it, and confident doing so, make sure it\u2019s not past date.Susan MacTavish Best the founder and CEO of Living MacTavish, carries a large stone in one hand.\u201cI did this on the island of Port-Cros after I heard a wild boar,\u201d says Best. I look at it both as a way for me to feel more confident and as a bonus, it [makes] my arm stronger.\u201d\u201cI always share my location when I go running,\u201d says Crain. \u201cI let my partner know where I'll be, and share my location with him via Google.\u201dJen McMahon, a certified integrative nutrition health coach, certified personal trainer and running coach, also makes a habit of letting people she trusts know when and where she\u2019s running.\u201cCreate a check-in system with a buddy so they know you made it home safely,\u201d she suggests.\u201cAlways carry your charged cell phone with you while running,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are new safety apps with GPS tracking that will dial the police or friend/family member for you if needed with just one click.\u201d\u201cIf you are ever attacked while running, use your powerful voice. Shout, yell, curse and do whatever you can to momentarily shock your attacker into changing their mind,\u201d says Jennifer Cassetta, a clinical nutritionist, personal trainer and self defense expert who founded Stilettos and Self Defense.If things get physical, Cassetta describes tactics you can use to take an attacker down:Some of us just really like to run at night, but as Dugar pointed out, women are vulnerable to predators, and they are most vulnerable at night when alone. Running in a group is the easiest way to handle this, but why not take it a step further by joining or forming a local movement that is determined to empower women and involve men through conversation and action.You may be able to turn to your workplace to get things off the ground.\u201cMy co-workers and I decided to start a movement, called Despite the Dark, where we shed light on the safety issues women face when they run, specifically at night,\u201d says Rachel Colonna, a creative studio designer and a founding member of the Despite the Dark team, who found that women co-workers were feeling more afraid of running after recent events such as the murders of runners Wendy Martinez and Mollie Tibbets, respectively.\u201cOur biggest takeaway is that there is safety in numbers, which is why we are creating a community of runners to ensure a safe environment,\u201d Colonna says. \u201cSadly, there is no way to be 100 percent safe all the time, but starting a conversation and a community is a way we have coped with the severity of these situations and started to find an answer.\u201dWant more tips like these?
