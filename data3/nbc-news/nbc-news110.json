{"id": "Harry Potter franchise's new 'Fantastic Beasts' sequel should not have been written by J.K. Rowling", "paragraph": "\u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d would be a far better movie if it was willing to be about its titular creatures, instead of its subhead. Overstuffed with plot twists and turns and frustratingly obscure in its worldbuilding, the highly anticipated sequel to \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d saunters in with the overconfidence of a mediocre white man, or Johnny Depp. And despite a strong cast and the Harry Potter cachet, it\u2019s sadly one more example of the failed prequel genre pioneered by George Lucas\u2019 \u201cStar Wars\u201d films of the early aughts and cemented by Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d trilogy.The problem begins and ends with Warner Brothers thinking it was a good idea to let J.K. Rowling write the scripts. Rowling is a writer of books \u2014 an excellent writer of books \u2014 and not necessarily a writer of screenplays. Yet, after spending 2012 developing \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d with someone else writing the script, she jumped at the idea of writing a movie based on her slim 2001 novel \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.\u201dOverstuffed with plot twists and turns and frustratingly obscure in its worldbuilding, the highly anticipated sequel to \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d saunters in with the overconfidence of a mediocre white man, or Johnny Depp.This was partly to keep control of her own material. (It is much easier to argue about what does and doesn\u2019t happen in your universe if you are the one penning the script.) But there\u2019s also a good reason why scriptwriters exist. Rowling\u2019s book \u201cOrder of the Phoenix\u201d for example, the longest of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, was adapted for Hollywood by a writer who knew how to take all her subplots and streamline them into a tight film. Some subtext becomes text, a few subplots get referenced, but most get cut.The \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series in particular is built around the slow reveal. The surface-level plot of an orphan who gets to go to the most magical school on Earth actually hides a much larger narrative about bigotry, fascism, love and sacrifice that only starts to solidify after several books and several hundred more pages. The first big reveal, which doesn\u2019t come until the end of \u201cPrisoner of Azkaban,\u201d is storytelling at some of its most magical.Movies don\u2019t have the same luxurious amount of time, at least not giant blockbusters. The first \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d movie synopsis promised fans a small-time magical romp with a bumbling magizoologist and a pair of accidentally switched briefcases. What viewers got was a story that barely had time to establish those characters, or check to see if their foundations were solid, before Rowling blew down the wall for the reveal. It could have worked, had the series given the viewers more time to settle in.\u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d has this same problem. Nominally about the adventures of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his American pals in Paris, the film again has way too many subplots, asides and backstories. Dumbledore (Jude Law) is plotting his eventual fight with evil genius Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) from the shadows of Hogwarts. Newt\u2019s older brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and his fianc\u00e9 Leta LeStrange (Zoe Kravtiz) worry about Dumbledore secretly being in the pocket of Grindelwald and leading their beloved Newt towards danger.Credence (Ezra Miller) and his pal Nagini (Claudia Kim) search for Credence\u2019s real mother, who may or may not be Leta\u2019s father\u2019s first wife, while another half-brother Yusuf (William Nadylum) searches for him as well. Nicholas Flamel shows up. Footage from World War II gets played out of what can only be described as a skull hookah. (Apparently Grindelwald\u2019s plot to subjugate and eradicate muggles is in service of stopping the Holocaust.)But perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole endeavor is watching a beloved franchise slowly crumble under the weight of unnecessary expectations.There are even more subplots but my editor made me cut them because even she was getting confused. The truth is, the best movie hidden away in here is an adorable little romantic comedy of a story, featuring the four stars of the first movie, Newt, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson), her sister Queenie (Alison Sodul) and muggle Jacob (Dan Fogelman). It would have cute and fun, and perfectly on trend. Ultimately, though, the plot that wins out is the one that puts Dumbledore and Grindelwald front and center, with an ending that is both shocking and confusing.But perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole endeavor is watching a beloved franchise slowly crumble under the weight of unnecessary expectations. It\u2019s as if Rowling was afraid the world she\u2019d built wouldn\u2019t be accepted unless every old character from the books had a cameo, even if their meticulously crafted backstories made such a thing chronologically impossible. She didn\u2019t need to tie every one of these new movies back to her original series every five minutes. Instead of trusting her own universe, it feels like she's now frantically dismantling it.One big reason Rowling's \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books are so beloved is that the world they created could support not only her own tale but the imaginations (and fan fiction) of thousands of devoted readers. Why she couldn\u2019t trust it to hold a story about Newt Scamander and his friends without making it about everything else is a mystery no one, not even Dumbledore, can solve.Ani Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.
