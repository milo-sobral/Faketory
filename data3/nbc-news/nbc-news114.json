They made up sources and refused to ask me, the only one that would know, for a quote....The vice president was also asked about NBC News\u2019 report that his current chief of staff, Nick Ayers, is under consideration to replace Gen. John Kelly as President Trump\u2019s chief of staff.\u201cIf the president is going to make any changes, I\u2019ll leave it to the president to announce changes,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut Nick has done a phenomenal job.
