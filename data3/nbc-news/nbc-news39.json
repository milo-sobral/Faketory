{"id": "Following backlash, company stops selling Caitlyn Jenner costume ", "paragraph": "After defending its controversial \"I Am Cait\" Halloween costume, Michigan-based company Costume Agent said it is yanking the product.\u201cAs of this morning, we\u2019ve decided to stop selling the costume,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told NBC News. \u201cAfter hearing concerns from those who are offended, regardless of our own thoughts and opinions, we decided to remove it.\u201dIn an interview with TMZ that was published Tuesday, a representative from the company said despite multiple threats, the product would continue being sold, adding, \"It's a costume. It's funny.\"The costume, which the company sold through eBay and Amazon, included a brunette wig, a gold medal and an outfit similar to the one Jenner wore during the 1976 Olympics \u2014 well before her 2015 gender transition. While Costume Agent claims the product is unisex, the model in one of its promotional images appears to be a bearded man.Following backlash from LGBTQ advocates who slammed the costume as transphobic and offensive, eBay pulled the product from its website Tuesday and, according to the Daily Mail, issued an apology.\u201cThis item is absolutely not permitted and the seller will be contacted directly,\u201d an eBay spokesperson told the news outlet.But while Costume Agent said it is no longer selling the controversial costume, the product was still available on Amazon Wednesday afternoon through a reseller named Rad Kell. Other items sold by the reseller include camouflage apparel, Texas longhorn cookie cutters and American flag patches.A commenter on Amazon wrote, \u201cThis product is transphobic. If you buy this, and wear it, you are harming the trans community.\u201dTransgender advocate Ashlee Marie Preston agreed, saying the costume is an \u201cattack\u201d on Jenner\u2019s \u201ctrans identity.\u201d\u201cPretending to celebrate Caitlyn Jenner in the product\u2019s description while using her \u2018dead name\u2019 in the product\u2019s title is the textbook definition of gaslighting,\u201d Preston said. A \u201cdead name\u201d refers to a transgender person\u2019s pre-transition name.Preston called out Amazon \u2014 which has a reputation for being a very LGBTQ-inclusive organization \u2014 for still selling the product.\u201cI call on Amazon to stop straddling the fence as allies to the LGBTQ community and kowtowing to bigotry while pocketing the profits,\u201d Preston said.Amazon did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.FOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM\u00a9 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL"}
