{"id": "Measles outbreak raging in Europe could be brought to U.S., doctors warn", "paragraph": "A raging measles outbreak in Europe may be a warning sign of what could occur in the U.S. if something doesn\u2019t change soon, experts say.So far this year, there have been 41,000 cases in Europe and 40 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The European experience may offer a window on how quickly things can go awry when parents choose not to vaccinate their children, doctors caution.Because measles is relatively rare in the U.S., many Americans have no idea of the disease's frightening impact and its stunning contagiousness.Many forget that measles isn\u2019t just a childhood disease.Silvia Rosetti, who lives in Rome, still has nightmares about contracting measles when she was 32 weeks pregnant in 2017. When Rosetti, now 41, was a child, measles vaccines were not required and she didn't think about the risk of exposure when she first became pregnant. She was healthy and ecstatic at the thought of having her first child. But then she caught measles and the symptoms came on in a rush: fever, cough and congestion so bad she could barely breathe.\u201cThe situation got worse and worse so they decided to do a C-section,\u201d Rosetti said. \u201cI went into quarantine for five days. I couldn\u2019t see my baby.\u201d Her newborn son, Nathan, was also quarantined until doctors determined he was not infected. Rosetti developed pneumonia as a complication of her measles and was so weak she couldn\u2019t stand up.\"And I had a rash even in my eyes, so I couldn't see anything,\" Rosetti told NBC News.Rosetti eventually recovered. Her baby, Nathan is now a year old and has gotten all his vaccinations.\"If you do the vaccination, you love yourself, you love your sons, and you love everybody,\" she said. \"You protect everybody. It's not just for myself or for my son.\"Rosetti is one of the more than 2,000 people in Italy who have been diagnosed with measles already this year.\u201cWe have a very serious situation,\u201d said Dr. Alberto Villani, pediatric infectious disease doctor at Bambino Ges\u00f9 Pediatric Hospital and the president of the Italian Pediatric Society. \u201cPeople are dying from measles. This was unbelievable five or 10 years ago.\u201dEven in England, which had been declared free of measles by the World Health Organization a year ago, cases are surging.The reason, experts say, is that in Europe, many parents have opted to skip vaccinating their children. \u201cIt\u2019s the main factor leading to the outbreaks,\u201d said Anca Paduraru of the European Commission in Brussels. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable to have in the 21st century diseases that should have been and could have been eradicated.\u201dAt least 95 percent of the population must have received at least two doses of measles vaccine to prevent outbreaks, WHO said. Some parts of Europe are below 70 percent.The measles vaccine has been available in the U.S. since 1963, and is now commonly administered to children in tandem with the vaccines for mumps and rubella. The effectiveness of the vaccine led federal officials to declare measles eradicated in the U.S. back in 2000. Before the vaccine, there were 3 million to 4 million cases annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201cThey don\u2019t realize their child is at risk for measles meningitis, encephalitis and permanent brain damage.\u201dBut the success of vaccines has at least in part been their undoing.Many parents are unfamiliar with the havoc measles can wreak because there have been few cases in the U.S. since the vaccine became widely available, said Dr. Jeffrey D. Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u201cPeople don\u2019t see them and so they forget about them or they think the diseases don\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Klausner said. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize their child is at risk for measles meningitis, encephalitis and permanent brain damage.\u201dAs in Europe, the number of children in the U.S. going unvaccinated has been increasing in certain parts of the country, said Dr. Albert W. Wu, an internist and professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\u201cThis is a real setup for disaster since measles is insanely contagious,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThis is an accident waiting to happen.\u201dWhy, when vaccines have been so successful at wiping out scourges like smallpox and polio, have parents become so skeptical of them?\u201cWhat has been happening in Europe is now happening in the U.S. \u2014 on a smaller scale at this point,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine and author of \u201cVaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism: My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist, Pediatrician, and Autism Dad.\u201dThe problem is the plethora of misinformation online, Hotez said. \u201cThe anti-vaccine groups have made very strategic use of the internet and social media,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s estimated that there are more than 400 anti-vaccine websites now, and when you put \u2018vaccine\u2019 into a search engine, it\u2019s almost inevitable you\u2019re going to get an anti-vaccine website popping up.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just the internet, Hotez said. \u201cNow there are political action committees popping up in several states, including Texas,\u201d he added.It\u2019s not clear what exactly is driving the anti-vaccine movement, Hotez said. But \u201cthere\u2019s an element of the anti-vaccine movement that is peddling alternative therapies and making money off of phony treatments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an element that have tied themselves to different political groups. In Texas the major anti-vaccine lobby likes to use libertarian garbage terms like \u2018medical freedom\u2019 or \u2018medical choice.\u2019 \u201dThe anti-vaxxers have had such a large impact that \u201cnow there is a terrific vulnerability in states like Texas and up in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cPeople forget that before kids were getting vaccinated we had between 400 and 700 deaths from measles annually in the U.S.\u201dRight now, there is no public relations campaign to explain why vaccines are so important, Hotez said. \u201cIt\u2019s left to a handful of academics who are willing, like me, to go out and tell their personal stories,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re clearly outgunned.\u201dHotez said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a major measles outbreak in the U.S. this year.That might help people understand what\u2019s at stake, Wu said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will take a really big outbreak in the United States before we begin to see a reversal of this anti-vaccine sentiment.\u201dLauren Dunn is a producer on NBC News' Medical Unit in New York.
