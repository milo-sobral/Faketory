{"id": "From sperm donor to 'Dad': When strangers with shared DNA become a family", "paragraph": "When Peter Ellenstein goes out to dinner with his children, who range in age from 17 to 30, the meals are raucous, and there is always a lot of catching up to do \u2014 especially because no one in the family knew each other before last October.Ellenstein, 57, donated sperm anonymously in his 20s and early 30s to make some extra cash, and never expected to meet any of his offspring. But this past year, thanks to online tools, including DNA test kits, he discovered that he has at least 24 biological children. A divorced theater director living in Los Angeles who never raised any kids of his own, Ellenstein has met 20 of them so far. One calls him every day and recently took a three-week trip to Europe with him; others are less involved, but still show up to family dinners, some with the hope that he\u2019ll pick up the check.When Ellenstein first found out about his offspring, \u201cit was just a huge shock,\u201d he said. Fearing the interactions might be awkward or disappointing, he was initially reluctant to meet his children.Now, though, his life revolves around them \u2014 whether he\u2019s proudly introducing them to his mother or helping them play practical jokes on one another.\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d he said. \u201cEach kid so far that I\u2019ve met is a whole other adventure and a whole new exciting thing in my life.\u201dAs more donor-conceived children connect with each other and their biological parents thanks to social media and at-home genetics tests such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com, a new kind of modern family is emerging. The first meeting between half-siblings and sperm donor dads can be fraught, but what follows over the ensuing years may be even more complicated. Some children grow close with their biological fathers and half-siblings, even moving in with them. Others are more hesitant, unsure of how or whether to build a relationship with people whose existence, in some cases, was a family secret.The newly formed connections raise delicate questions: Should a sperm donor who didn\u2019t raise his children refer to them as his son or daughter? Should they call him Dad? And how does the introduction of this new blood relative affect existing relationships with the parents and siblings that a person grew up with?NBC News spoke to more than a dozen sperm donors, donor-conceived children and parents who received sperm donations about what happens when strangers with shared DNA get to know each other. Some donor-conceived children spoke glowingly of spending Father\u2019s Day with their sperm donors. Others described friction with the parents who raised them. One recalled learning in her 30s that she was donor-conceived, which set off panic attacks over her sense of self, even though she and her sperm donor get along well.And for others, the hoped-for relationship never materialized at all.\"There\u2019s never a dull moment.\"\u201cThere\u2019s no social script for any of these scenarios,\u201d said Erin Jackson, founder of We Are Donor Conceived, a support group and resource page with more than 650 members on Facebook.Jackson, 38, of San Diego, started the group in 2016 after finding out that she had been donor-conceived. She had tracked down her biological father and sent him a letter, tucking a photo of herself inside. He didn\u2019t write back until two years later, and when he finally did, \u201che basically told me to get lost,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI tried not to get my hopes up, but I was still disappointed.\u201dNow, she helps others navigate the emotional twists and turns.\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d she said.Although there are no firm numbers, experts say more people than ever are connecting with biological relatives. Over 15 million have signed up for 23andMe and Ancestry.com, the two major at-home genetics testing companies, both of which offer an optional relatives matching tool (the companies do not disclose how many matches have been made).The matching tools work by showing customers others who have signed up for the same genetics test whose DNA overlaps with their own, if they have also opted in to the feature. By displaying the percentage of overlap, it indicates how close the relation is. Users can send then messages to their connections through 23andMe or Ancestry.com.Meanwhile, on the Donor Sibling Registry, the largest matching site for donor-conceived people, more than 16,300 offspring have found half-siblings or donors, with nearly a quarter of those connections being made in just the last three years, says its co-founder and director, Wendy Kramer, whose son, Ryan, is donor-conceived. Kramer and her son co-founded the registry in 2000.Increasingly, donors and their offspring are going beyond an initial online connection, according to Rosanna Hertz, a professor of sociology and women\u2019s and gender studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts who researches contemporary reproduction.\u201cIn early surveys that I did [in 2009], people would find other donor siblings. They would exchange emails, maybe some photographs, and that would be it. Now more people are choosing to meet offline,\u201d said Hertz, the co-author of a new book, \u201cRandom Families: Genetic Strangers, Sperm Donor Siblings and the Creation of New Kin.\u201dBut the unregulated landscape of sperm banks has added to the challenges donors and offspring face when they meet. For one thing, with no federal data or tracking, donors have no idea how many offspring they have sired \u2014 and consequently, no idea how many they can expect to hear from.Despite efforts to increase regulation, sperm banks in America operate with barely any federal scrutiny. Experts say there is no official tally of how many babies have been born as a result of sperm donations in the U.S, nor is there a large effort on the part of banks to obtain such data (most ask sperm recipients to self-report any pregnancies and births, but they do not require it).And while there are recommendations for how many times a single sperm donor\u2019s specimen should be used, there are no laws officially limiting how many babies can be born from one man\u2019s sperm, as there are in the United Kingdom, Norway and Hong Kong, among many other countries.For the growing number of donors and their children, figuring out a relationship can be complex, Hertz said.\"The donors usually play it by what the kids want.\"Some donors want to get to know their offspring, but have never told their spouses that they used to donate sperm. Other times, a donor gets overly excited and will post pictures of his offspring on Facebook, upsetting the parents who raised the children.But generally, donors are respectful, Hertz said, based on her interviews with more than 550 people and surveys of more than 4,000 others.\u201cThe donors usually play it by what the kids want,\u201d she said.That is the approach that Ellenstein says he has taken with each of his children. Rachel White, 24, was the first to make contact with Ellenstein after she used the scant details that the sperm bank had given her mother to find him on the Internet Movie Database in 2017 and match his birthday and other information.When White, who works in music production, first met Ellenstein, she saw a lot of herself in him \u2014 and the similarities went beyond their looks. Ellenstein bumped into a table as he walked toward her at the Los Angeles cafe where they met \u2014 White, whose mother is dancer, had always wondered where her clumsiness came from.White talks to Ellenstein on the phone daily now, asking for advice on everything from money to car repairs, and catching up on how her half-siblings are doing. She said she sometimes jokingly calls Ellenstein \u201cdad,\u201d but he\u2019s more like an uncle.\"He almost feels like a strange, older, male extension of myself.\"\u201cHe almost feels like a strange, older male extension of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut obviously we\u2019re not the same person. We are vastly different in many ways, but it feels like a weird limb that I discovered.\u201dIn a private Facebook group with his offspring, Ellenstein has noticed that his children share his love for board games, podcasts and puns and word play.\u201cI\u2019ve been nicknamed all kinds of things by them \u2014 \u2018Papa Jerk\u2019 included,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThey all have a pretty word-oriented and snarky and kind of profane sense of humor. There\u2019s no shortage of swearing.\u201dMichael Rubino, a Los Angeles artist, donated sperm in the 1990s in the hopes of helping couples struggling with infertility. He has 20 offspring, 18 of whom he has met. A Democrat, atheist and vegetarian, Rubino was initially worried when he first heard from one of his biological children: Nathan Mayes, a Republican, evangelical Christian from Bryant, Arkansas, who enjoys hunting.Mayes, 20, also wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. He does mission work and was worried about Rubino\u2019s lack of belief in God. Nonetheless, he flew to California a couple years ago to meet Rubino, 59, and they bonded over their shared passion for creating art.\"We are polar opposites, yet we are so much alike.\"Encouraged, Mayes then invited Rubino to meet the family who raised him. But Mayes was nervous about how Rubino would respond to displays of faith, so he requested beforehand that his family not say grace during the visit, something they normally do at every meal.\u201cWe were still kind of getting to know each other, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable,\u201d Mayes said.A few days into the visit \u2014 during which Rubino found more common ground with the family than he expected \u2014 the family confessed to Rubino that they usually said grace, but had held off at Mayes\u2019 request.That struck Rubino as considerate but unnecessary.\u201cWhen I found out, I said, \u2018Oh no, you guys. Nathan, please be yourself.\u2019\u201dSince then, their relationship has strengthened. Like Rubino, Mayes enjoys painting. So when Mayes was scraping together money for a study-abroad program, Rubino invited him to join him on a mural-painting job in California. The two have since worked on two other murals together.\u201cI was excited and really, really nervous when I did my first painting with him,\u201d Mayes said. \u201cBut he is so easy and comfortable to work with.\u201dTheir relationship now is like that of \u201cbest friends,\u201d Mayes added. \u201cWe are polar opposites, yet we are so much alike.\u201dJessica Share, whose 13-year-old daughter Alice Mikell is donor-conceived, never expected to meet her child\u2019s sperm donor, never mind date him and move in with him. But that is exactly what happened last year.Until she signed Alice up for a 23andMe test, Share, who lived in Oregon and works in marketing, simply knew Alice\u2019s father as Donor No. 2008 at the Fairfax Cryobank. When Aaron Long, 52, popped up as a DNA match in February 2017, Share sent him a message.Long, a communications specialist for a nonprofit in Seattle, had donated sperm more than two decades earlier to make some money after returning from teaching English overseas. He had already begun hearing from some of his offspring (he has at least 10), and he wrote back a warm introduction about himself to Share, attaching a 13-page biography that he had written and shared with his other biological children.For the next five months, Share and Long continued to exchange messages. Then in July 2017, Long invited all of the biological children he had connected with by that point to visit Seattle.When they met in person, Share was struck by how familiar Long already seemed: So many of his mannerisms were similar to their daughter\u2019s.\u201cI felt like I had been watching him for over a decade,\u201d said Share, who has another daughter who was also donor-conceived by Long (that daughter lives with Share\u2019s ex-wife and has not met Long). \u201cI had these threads of him. This wasn\u2019t what made the bond, but it certainly made him very familiar to me because he right away looked and acted like people I had known and loved for a decade.\u201dWeeks after meeting Long, Share, 42, and Alice were having trouble with their landlord in Oregon. A spot opened up in Long\u2019s building, a communal living cooperative, and given how close Long was growing with Share, he suggested they move in for a few months.It ended up going well \u2014 so well that Long and Share began dating and now live together, with Alice. In May, another biological daughter of Long\u2019s, who is 21, joined them from Virginia.For Share, the new living arrangement is a welcome twist. But everyone in the family is quick to acknowledge that while they live in close quarters, Long is not a father figure to Alice \u2014 especially Alice herself.\"We\u2019re definitely not a family. This is not the nuclear \u2018Brady Bunch\u2019 thing.\"While Alice says the two are \u201cchill\u201d together, the teen sees Long more as her mother\u2019s boyfriend than anything else.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not a family. This is not the nuclear \u2018Brady Bunch\u2019 thing,\u201d Alice said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just adopt someone as your dad, despite what chick flicks say.\u201dFor Ellenstein, the new relationships with his 24 children have gone well \u2014 so far. He sometimes worries that more offspring will be discovered and that he will be spread too thin to give each the attention that they want and deserve.But each child, in his mind, has been an unexpected bonus in his life.\u201cI lucked out,\u201d Ellenstein said.Elizabeth Chuck is a reporter for NBC News.\u00a9 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL"}
