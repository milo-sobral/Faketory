In the 1990s and into the 2000s I was writing for Wizard magazine, which at the time was kind of a catch-all, 800-pound gorilla in the comics business. And Stan, as we all learned from his many MCU cameos, knew the value of publicity. He liked seeing his name in print, which meant he was happy to sit down with a reporter\u2014especially if I picked up the tab. So in 1999, we started meeting regularly for mid-day meals.Captain Marvel and the Long, Strange History of Female Superhero NamesDoes Comics Culture Have an Inferiority Complex?Video: Stan Lee Marvels at How Tech Has Changed SuperheroesThere was rarely an agenda during a lunch with Stan, who passed away today at age 95. It was just a semi-regular catch-up, very friendly and collegial, although it\u2019s hard to consider yourself a colleague to one of the most prolific creators in all of comics.We all know \u201cStan the Man,\u201d the showman persona Stan first created during Marvel\u2019s ascension in the 1960s and maintained throughout his long life and illustrious career. But once every few weeks or so, I got to see glimpses of Stan the man, lower-case \u201cm.\u201d During those years, I learned a great many truths about Stan Lee.Stan\u2019s office at POW! Entertainment was at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. We\u2019d usually meet and just tumble down the street, heading south-ish on Beverly to the deli Nate \u2019n Al or the Cheesecake Factory. Usually the Cheesecake Factory. Stan hated to wait for a table, so we\u2019d usually try to scope out where we could get seated quickly.Once seated, Stan rarely deviated from his standard order: two eggs over easy, toast, bacon, sliced tomatoes, and black coffee. Starting about a decade ago, he\u2019d sometimes skip the bacon in deference to his doctor and cholesterol.In 2014, Fatburger opened a franchise right across the street from Stan\u2019s office. Stan was in heaven. A Fatburger and a vanilla shake became his second go-to lunch.I always asked Stan when he was going to retire. For years, I got variations of the same answer:\u201cI\u2019m not going to retire. Most people retire so they can go do what they want. I\u2019m already doing what I want. I like to write. I like to work with creative people. If I retired, I\u2019d be giving up my fun.\u201dAnd so it remained. Stan was in the office every day at 9 am.Stan loved to work. We\u2019ve established that. He also loved to leave the office at about 5:30 pm with the sole purpose of heading home to spend time with his wife, Joan, who passed away last year.Lunches were one thing, and Stan could justify that as \u201cbusiness\u201d\u2014but beyond that, during many years of what I can accurately describe as a friendship, I got Stan to socialize with me outside of business hours exactly once. I practically had to bribe him. Which leads us to:He loved the different segments, the music, and generally thought the whole damn package was brilliant and imaginative.In 2000, Disney released Fantasia 2000, an ever-so-slightly remastered version of the original. A large IMAX screen was set up on Howard Hughes Parkway in Los Angeles, and an impromptu outdoor theater was established for the purpose of screening the flick. I got tickets, and invited Stan to see the premiere screening. He accepted.We met near the theatre, had a cocktail, and saw the film, which Stan loved. Immediately after, he hopped in the car and cannonballed out. \u201cGotta get home to Joanie,\u201d he said before we parted ways.Stan might have come from the era of the three-martini lunch, but he would rarely imbibe when we met up. On the rare occasions he would\u2014usually Fridays\u2014he would always declare with typical Stan Lee theatrics, \u201cThis occasion calls for an adult beverage!\u201d and order a screwdriver.Stan would occasionally knock back those screwdrivers at the old comedians' haunt in Beverly Hills, where he was a member. About 2003 or so, Stan sponsored me for membership in the club \u2026 rather against my will. He just called me one day and said I should join the Friar\u2019s. Said I'd love it. Told me a nice guy from the Club was gonna call me. Nowhere in the conversation was there a question mark; this was simply going to happen.I politely inquired of Stan if, perhaps, median age among members was reaching 82 years old and current members were being asked to bring in new blood before all the old blood perished from this Earth. \"No, nothing like that, True Believer!\" Stan assured me. (OK, he probably didn\u2019t say \u201cTrue Believer.\u201d) \"It's just a great place. You've been there! You love it! You'd love being a member!\"Sure enough, later that day, I got a call, and they sent me a membership packet. A polite salesman called me a few times to follow up, until I told him that I really wasn't interested. Stan and I would have to settle for screwdrivers at the Cheesecake Factory.Before he decamped to LA in 1981, Stan was also a member of the New York Friar\u2019s Club. And so was Carmine Infantino, DC Comics\u2019 editorial director and later publisher between 1967 and 1976.Marvel hit the comics world like a house afire in 1961, and slowly but surely inched up the charts, taking bites out of DC\u2019s market share every year. By 1971, Marvel finally surpassed DC. Like any business clash, this was a war. Over the course of many years, the two publishers fought for the same fans on the same pulp-paper battlefields. The rivalry between the companies was fierce.But once a week, a truce was called. Stan admired Infantino\u2019s artistic sensibility\u2014he had offered him a job at Marvel before DC came calling\u2014and he liked him personally. Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, Stan rolled up his sleeves and tried to knock DC out. But once a week, every week, through the late \u201960s and early \u201970s, Stan would sit down with Infantino for a few friendly cocktails at the Friar\u2019s Club. When the business day was over, the two rivals would meet as friends.Stan Lee wrote the \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d newspaper strip starting in 1977, with longtime collaborator John Romita as the first artist. Later, other artists took over. As they came and went, Stan\u2019s deal with the syndicate stayed the same: he got paid for the strip, and had to pay the artists out of his own pocket.And so Stan ran a mini accounts-payable office every two weeks. He would scratch out a personal check to inker Joe Sinnott or letterer Stan Sakai and dash them off a short letter thanking them for their work. A letter to Sinnott would always start with \u201cHi, Joe!\u201d in a word balloon coming out of Spider-Man\u2019s mouth on Stan\u2019s custom Spidey stationery. The personal touch was always important to Stan.Around the time I started asking Stan when he was going to retire, I became obsessed with chipping away at the showman. The public image was so refined, so polished, I figured there just had to be something different underneath.There wasn\u2019t.After 95  years, Stan remained remarkably consistent. Walking down the street, he\u2019d move faster than you, even in his tenth decade. He\u2019d happily wave at people who recognized him. He\u2019d sprint a couple steps ahead to open a door for a lady. And over the years, I saw him happily autograph dozens of slightly soggy Cheesecake Factory napkins.The voice you heard in movies and cartoons was the voice he had every day. It commanded, if it didn\u2019t boom, and always had a friendly quality. Witticisms and puns would flow, along with Shakespeare quotes\u2014Stan loved the classics. And the tone and timbre was always enthusiastic.\u201cI get excited easily,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cI live a nice life, and I\u2019m usually very happy. Why not share a little of that?\u201dStan believed in God and an afterlife, no doubt. But he was skeptical about channeling those beliefs through a religion. He examined various faiths, charting their strengths and weaknesses. Stan believed that if religion made someone a better person, then he was all for it\u2014but he wasn\u2019t sure of it for himself.He thought that \u201cgolden rule\u201d was the key, and he really couldn\u2019t understand why people couldn\u2019t just take a few seconds out of their day to be nice to others. He counted on a reward. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you get wings,\u201d he once told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think you sit on a cloud and play a harp. But I believe if you live a good life, there\u2019s something for you.\u201dStan saw God not as perfect, but as a flawed being, just like man. Stan loved to quote Omar Khayy\u00e1m\u2019s Rubaiyat line, \u201cDid the hand then of the potter shake?\u201d To Stan, it meant that just as the hand of a potter could make an imperfect jug because the potter is flawed, so too is God flawed in his creation of an imperfect man. Stan also found great joy in reading and re-reading Lin Yutang\u2019s The Importance of Living. Yutang was raised an ardent Christian, but later became, in his own words, \u201ca happy pagan.\u201d Stan believed in God, but thoroughly enjoyed the notion that God was far from perfect.In February of 2003, I got an odd call from Stan.\u201cHey, I got a question for ya,\u201d Stan bellowed through the phone in his very Stan-like way. \u201cYou know a lot of people, and they tend to listen to you. Can I ask you for a favor? They\u2019ve got this new Hulk movie, and I don\u2019t have a cameo appearance in it. Maybe you can call [producer] Gale Anne Hurd, and see if they can find a part for me. Whaddya think?\u201dHonestly, my heart sank. I \u201cget\u201d that the cameo appearances are fun and all, and a nice little wink to the audience, but in my mind\u2014not that it should have any bearing on how Stan felt\u2014they were just the parsley on the edge of a massive plate of career achievements. I think it can be easily argued that Stan Lee (or perhaps Stephen King) is the most significant American author of the 20th century. I saw Stan as a man possessing a tremendous body of work, and the fact that he felt he had to do these teeny movie shout-outs to validate the work felt incongruent to me. The fact that he wasn\u2019t getting the response he wanted through normal channels saddened me. And worst of all, I knew there was practically zero I could do about it.I backpedaled as fast as I could. \u201cStan, I barely know Gale Hurd,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I met her twice, and I\u2019m pretty damn sure she couldn\u2019t pick me out of a lineup. I\u2019d help you if I could, but all I can do is call her office, get shuffled off to an assistant, leave a message, and wait. Maybe this one just isn\u2019t meant to be.\u201dStan saw where I was going in about half a second. He backpedaled from my backpedaling, saying it was OK, and sorry to bother me. I assured him it was no bother.I never saw the 2003 Hulk flick, but I hear he got his cameo. We\u2019ll call that a win.We chat with Stan Lee about the characters he helped create and his latest ventures.CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
