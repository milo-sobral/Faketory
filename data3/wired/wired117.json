Though the provider\u2019s subscriber base reportedly consisted of about 100,000 cinephiles, FilmStruck\u2019s demise prompted an online petition that\u2019s so far accrued more than 50,000 signatures, and earned tweets of support (as well as a few passionate letters from such filmmakers as Guillermo del Toro and Barbra Streisand. Some FilmStruck lovers are no doubt concerned about the startling number of classic films missing from streaming services; others probably want to ensure they had 7-day-a-week access to 8 \u00bd. But because 2018 is the year in which literally nothing good has happened, their pleas are likely to be ignored.For those hoping to cram one last movie-blitz before the site departs, here are 10 invaluable classics that illustrate FilmStruck\u2019s breadth, depth, and sheer art-house-in-your-house joy.The first entry in writer-director Wim Wenders\u2019 famed mid-\u201970s \u201cRoad Movie\u201d trilogy casts R\u00fcdiger Vogler as an aimless, irritable writer who\u2019s tasked with accompanying a rebellious young teenager (played by Yella Rottl\u00e4nder) from America to Germany. An unassuming, happily chatty travelogue that\u2019s at once unsparingly funny and deeply empathetic.Robert Redford, at his peak early-\u201970s power, stars as a reluctant U.S. Senate candidate who\u2019s plunged into the national spotlight\u2014and finds that all he can do is stare back blankly. A cynical and absorbing American-politics tale, one as relevant now as it was more than 45 years ago.Not to be confused with the 1982 remake, this genuinely creepy big-city horror tale finds Simone Simon as a young woman afflicted with a long-running feline curse. Worth it alone for the film\u2019s infamous pool scene, a remarkable feat of shadows and sound effects.Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s mid-\u201990s hit\u2014a propulsive tale of love, heartache and \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019\u201d in Hong Kong\u2014has become inexplicably elusive in recent years: The Criterion Collection DVD is now a high-priced rarity, and FilmStruck appears to be the only streaming service hosting this gorgeous and essential romantic drama.A low-budget time-capsule mockumentary from writer-director Rusty Cundieff, Fear spoofs early-\u201990s hip-hop culture via the antics of N.W.H., a fictitious bad-boy rap outfit trying to be taken seriously. Fear\u2019s jabs come off as more affectionate than acidic, and some jokes have aged better than others. But try watching it and not having [\u201cMy Peanuts\u201d[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sH9lYCMf1w) in your head for a days afterward.Noir has been a staple of FilmStruck\u2019s line-up, in no small part because of its access to the Warner Bros. archives. And rainy-day viewing doesn\u2019t get much better than John Huston\u2019s classic slow-burning tale of a virtuous World War II vet (Humphrey Bogart) who stares down a cackling kingpin (Edward G. Robinson) while stranded at a hurricane-hampered hotel. Contains perhaps the greatest mid-shave rants ever filmed.Granted, pretty much everyone has seen this towering monster-movie classic, but the FilmStruck edition features the informative (and hard-to-find) commentary track by historian Ronald Haver\u2013widely considered the first of its kind.Director Elaine May\u2019s filmography includes one irrefutably perfect film (The Heartbreak Kid), one unfairly beat-up semi-diversion (Ishtar), and one recently reclaimed lost \u201870s pearl: Mikey and Nicky, a tale of two scheming, skeevy L.A. mob-mooks (played by Peter Falk and John Cassavetes) who get in way over their heads ... and get deeper in conversation along the way.This genial, rollicking 22-minute short\u2014which premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival\u2014stars Philip Burgers as a mute, an on-the-run mystery man who stumbles into one unexpected set-up after the next. Produced by SuperDeluxe, the comedy outlet whose own existence was cut down by Warner Media this fall, The Passage is the sort of sweet-natured, experimental tale that fits right in among FilmStruck\u2019s offerings.It\u2019s not the most riveting documentary by the legendary Maysles Brothers (that would be Gimme Shelter, also on FilmStruck). Nor is it the most immediately quotable (that honor goes to Grey Gardens, which you can watch on\u2014wait for it!\u2014FilmStruck). But Salesman, which follows a crew of Boston-area bible-stumpers on their door-to-door sales calls, is an unforgettable (and sometimes uncomfortable) depiction of bright-eyed, go-get-\u2019em mid-20th-century capitalism\u2014and the quiet strain it imposes on its disciples.Hacker and security researcher Samy Kamkar takes a look at a variety of hacking scenes from popular media and examines their authenticity.CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
