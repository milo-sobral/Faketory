You\u2019ve been staring at the modern hellscape known as Twitter for hours now, refreshing feed after feed. Your eyes are glazed over but you keep going; you\u2019re too deep into Politics Twitter to stop. That\u2019s when you see her. Or maybe...it? The account\u2019s handle is @DeplorableGranny4545. The profile picture is a slightly blurry selfie of a white woman who is maybe in her 60s, sporting a Make America Great Again hat and a duckface. Her bio is full of seemingly nonsensical hashtags, out of place punctuation marks, and, strangely enough, the phrase \u201cNot A bOt!!\u201d You take another sip of six-hour-old coffee and look closer. Over the last 3 days @DeplorableGranny4545 has tweeted nearly 2,000 times, averaging about 660 retweets and seven original tweets a day. Each one is about politics and includes a litany of hashtags and links popular with the far right. Is this a bot?, you wonder, trying to mentally calculate if would even be possible for a human being to accomplish that much in a day.You\u2019ve stumbled on a question that Twitter itself can\u2019t quite figure out. Technically speaking, bots are automated programs designed to perform a specific task, like tweet every new word that appears in the New York Times, colorize black and white photos on Reddit, or connect you with a customer service agent. There are bad ones, good ones, and countless more in between. Bots are often associated with sites like Twitter, but there are many other types.A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation. You\u2019ve probably encountered one on Facebook Messenger, a retail website, or on Tinder (sorry to break it to you, but that extremely-out-of-your-league model you matched with that\u2019s interested in knowing your mother\u2019s maiden name likely isn\u2019t real). As you probably know, interactions with bots don't feel as mechanical as you might think. In 1963, a rudimentary chatbot dubbed ELIZA won users over despite laughably basic canned responses for a therapy-like messaging service. ELIZA mostly just turned users\u2019 statements into questions based on a number of keywords (e.g. \u201cI am unhappy,\u201d \u201cCan you explain what made you unhappy?\") and would revert to blanket statements like \u201cI see\u201d or \u201cPlease go on\u201d anytime it got confused, yet people cited feeling an emotional connection with the bot. Since then, chatbots have come a long way, but most still operate using some combination of machine learning and set scripts.Other bots keep the internet running smoothly. Crawler bots help search engines like Google decide what to display when you frantically search for \u201cHow to tell if dog ate AirPods\u201d at midnight on a Tuesday; monitoring bots, well, monitor things, like whether Twitter is down and your soul is finally free; aggregator bots keep your RSS feeds filled with piping hot takes about whatever Donald Trump tweeted that day.What isn\u2019t a bot?Most things, really. Much like trolls or fake news, the term \u201cbot\u201d has lost much of its actual meaning, becoming a vague tech-adjacent buzzword. This is especially true in the case of the so-called propaganda bot, which has morphed into a catchall term for a Scary Fake Account With A Specific Purpose. There are countless \u201cbot trackers\u201d and dashboards out there that claim to show what the big bad bots are up to on sites like Twitter. Most aren\u2019t tracking bots per se, but rather accounts associated with known groups of bad actors, like Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, or accounts exhibiting \u201cbot-like activity.\u201dWhat is bot-like activity?Though there are many types of bots, \u201cbot-like activity\u201d is typically used only in reference to Twitter. Retweeting things hundreds of times a day, spamming the same link repeatedly, and using multiple accounts to amplify the same message are all good indicators of bot-like activity, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the account is a bot.Even Twitter gets confused sometimes. Earlier this year, a group of Trump-loving grannies ran into trouble because they spent up to 14 hours a day tweeting about the president and his allies. Some retweeted content from the same handful of other accounts over 500 times a day at all hours for months on end, flooding their followers\u2019 feeds with a stream of seemingly automated activity. Twitter decided they were bots and kicked them off the service. Yet the women were very real humans.So, are bots bad or not?Bots are having a bit of an image problem right now. Sure, some bots aren\u2019t great, but most range from innocuous to delightful. Twitter is full of purposefully good (and sometimes even pretty funny) bots. There\u2019s a bot that replaces the word \u201cblockchain\u201d in headlines with \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d another one that shares surreal memes from Reddit, and one that just tweets out random verbs followed by the phrase \u201cme daddy.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/blkchninstitute/status/1060934448882049024https://twitter.com/bot_me_daddy/status/1060026772543193088https://twitter.com/MemesSurreal/status/1060803147185176576You can even make your own without much effort on sites like CheapBotsDoneQuick.
