But in his late twenties, he left his government gig and set off to explore Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru with botanist Aime Bonpland.He did an astounding amount of work during his travels, in pursuit of his hypothesis that \u201call forces of nature are interlaced and interwoven\u201d\u2014and that, maybe, he could figure out how. He mapped the Orinoco River; he saw Mercury pass in front of the sun; he realized that guano was fertilizer; he sliced into and was shocked by electric eels; he studied Inca ruins; he catalogued 2,000 new plant species. Humboldt became not just an inspector but also an interpreter of the world, and he settled down in Paris to share his thoughts and illustrations in 30 written volumes. People loved it, and they loved him. He was one of the most famous people in Europe.Until, that is, he wasn\u2019t. Public memory is short, and others\u2014like Darwin\u2014scaffolded their knowledge onto his, becoming the new names on people\u2019s lips.Like most of us today, publisher Jordi Anton wasn\u2019t familiar with Humboldt until he read a biography by Andrea Wulf, which the New York Review of Books brags \u201cwill make Humboldtians of us all.\u201d It certainly made one of Anton, who set out on a journey to learn more\u2014and possibly bring Humboldt's work back to the limelight as part of his own print business. \u201c[Wulf] talks repeatedly about the illustrations of his trips,\u201d says Anton, \u201cbut after researching a bit on the internet, it was very difficult to find this material for the general public.\u201dAnton decided to change that.  Unlike most of us, he had the tools to do so. He\u2019s the founder of a small, independent press called Kronecker Wallis, which republishes original, seminal scientific works, with modern, clean design. They're the kind of thing you\u2019d be proud to stash on your Swedish coffee table. That attention to aesthetics is partly because beautiful is better, but also because the bones of these old works are largely in the public domain. Anyone can go get the text for free. If you want people to pay for a copy, you have to add something\u2014and Anton is asking people to pay quite a bit for them, with texts ranging from around $40 up to $200. That puts them out of reach of many readers, and suggests that they are as much art objects as they are scientific studies.Still, Anton hopes people will do more than impress their friends with fancy spines. He wants people to actually read them, and appreciate the science that brought us the understanding we have today. \u201cIf we think about it from the point of view of literature in general, I would ask myself why we should be interested in the first edition of Alice in Wonderland, Jane Eyre or Anna Karenina?\u201d says Anton. \u201cReading the work as it was written by its author transports us to how they imagined it while writing it, how the author chose each of the words and not others.\u201dSetting aside the commercialism, it's a philosophy that historians enthusiastically endorse, to help people understand that science is not a set of static facts but a process that will likely unfold until there aren't humans anymore. Design-y reprints might be an effective way to convey that reality, for those willing to plunk down for a collectible. Kronecker Wallis's edition of Humboldt's work, called Illustrating Nature, showcases his text and illustrations as if the book itself were a modern museum, with tri-column trilingual copy, antique-y prints, full-bleed diagrams, and bound insert pages of explanation in neutral Army colors.So far, Kronecker Wallis has published Newton\u2019s Principia, and will be shipping out his Opticks and a college notebook of his early next year. Around then, too, the press will publish a visually amped up version of Euclid\u2019s Elements, a 13-book series. In the mid-1800s, author and engineer Oliver Byrne republished the first six of those, reimagining them graphically, using visuals that seem straight from the brush of Piet Mondrian. But Byrne didn\u2019t finish the job. Anton would like to: all 13, illustration-centric.\u201cEuclid\u2019s book is probably the most important scientific book of all time,\u201d says Michael Gordin, a Princeton science historian1 who uses historical primary sources in his classes (some schools, like St. Johns College, go even further, and incorporate \u201cGreat Books\u201d into a whole curriculum). Yet it's not a given that reading the works of Newton, or Carl Linnaeus, or any of the other pioneers is worth students' time, now that their insights are centuries out of date.The reason has to do with the culture of science as much as the science itself. Neither Linnaeus nor Newton\u2014nor anyone, ever\u2014was right, or complete, about everything. There are ideas in old, once-dogmatic science that we bright modern folk can now laugh off. The topography of your skull tells of your character and intellect? Haha, what idiots phrenologists were. Gordin tries to train his students to look at such research as people saw it in its prime, to read it like they would an Astrophysical Journal paper from June. \u201cI want them to get to think that way about the opposite thing, the thing that is not considered correct,\u201d says Gordin, \u201cto understand why a very smart person might believe it. That\u2019s a way of learning empathy for the past, and a way to see that the truth we know now is not obvious.\u201dWhat seems true now probably also isn\u2019t permanent. Just as the \"knowledge\" that Earth is the center of the universe was tossed into the void, \u201cmost of the science that\u2019s published this year, in 10 years we\u2019ll think was wrong,\u201d says Gordin. \"Not completely wrong. But incomplete or with inadequate variables. That\u2019s the way science works.\u201dBut that\u2019s not often the way students, at least early in their education, learn about science. Most people grow up thinking about science in a textbook-centric way. \u201cTextbooks, if you think about it, are a list of statements,\u201d says Massimo Mazzotti, director of Berkeley\u2019s Center for Science, Technology, Medicine, & Society. \u201cVery clear, very neat: \u2018This is what we think is the case.\u2019\u201dWhen reading a historical scientist\u2019s account of their own work, though, a different sentiment sticks out. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, \u2018Things are complicated,\u2019\u201d says Mazzotti. \u201cPeople are struggling to understand how the world works.\u201dThose people\u2014Darwin, Newton, lots of other old white men\u2014were also steeped in the assumptions and conventions of their time, which is easier to see when you\u2019re not of their time. That means, by inference, that the scientists of our time are (gasp!) subject to their own biases, whether scientific or social. \u201cAs a scientist in our society, you\u2019re not trained to start questioning the broader framework in which you\u2019re working,\u201d says Mazzotti. A little historical context could help with that.You don't need a pretty copy of Principia to do that. Mazzotti's and Gordin's classes are probably full of kids who just downloaded PDFs, with no special layout to distract from or enhance the philosophical or scientific points. Kronecker Wallis's editions, meanwhile, are very limited, and very expensive\u2014their price the price of art for display and admiration, rather than pure analytical perusal. They are decidedly not the ones that will bring historical awareness or humility to the masses. When a curious dilettante or a serious student wants some context, they'll still likely turn to library loans or free ebooks. But if part of Kronecker Wallis's point is also to unite two cultures (here's a free copy of author and chemist C.P. Snow's eponymous treatise on the division between science and the humanities), portraying old science as an exquisite object\u2014and also something that isn't locked in its original form, confined to its original era\u2014then a bound edition with weight and gloss can convey that, to a certain well-heeled demographic.For any kind of edition, though, fancy or not, seeing a big bound book of science, caught up in its own struggles and assumptions, is humbling, not just for scientists but for anyone who enjoys the fruits of their labor, some of which will warp and rot in time. \u201cYou\u2019re just one moment, one iteration, in the process of knowledge-making,\u201d says Mazzotti. Maybe someday, someone will reprint your work, and use it as an example of just how absurd those 21st-century intellectuals were. And that future person will see, through your flaws, that they too will never be totally right. All forces of nature are interlaced and interwoven, after all, and those forces include us.1Update 10-19-18 2:15 pm EDT: This story has been updated to reflect Michael Gordin's institutional affiliation.CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
