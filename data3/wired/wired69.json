On social media I\u2019m connected with so many people who either read horror or write horror, and that\u2019s all people have been talking about for a week or two straight.\u201dThe 10-episode season was directed by Mike Flanagan, who has established himself as a top horror director with feature films like Oculus and Hush. Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley ranks the early episodes of The Haunting of Hill House among his all-time favorite ghost stories.\u201cI would give my strongest possible recommendation for the first six episodes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have any interest in haunted house stories or anything like that at all, you\u2019ve got to watch the first six episodes.\u201dUnfortunately the later episodes have divided critics. Writer Leah Schnelbach had mixed feelings about the finale. \u201cI was glad that they went on the happier side, rather than being nihilistic,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then the more I thought about it, I\u2019m like, \u2018They had to kind of tear down the worldbuilding to make all of that work.'\u201dScience fiction author Seth Dickinson also had issues with the finale, but felt that the show\u2019s strong characterization more than makes up for any deficiencies. He thinks viewers should give the show a try and judge the ending for themselves.\u201cThe show does amazing work in the first six episodes, and then things wrap up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might like the ending and you might not, but by that point you\u2019re definitely going to care about the people in the show.\u201dListen to the complete interview with Paul Tremblay, Leah Schnelbach, and Seth Dickinson in Episode 333 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.David Barr Kirtley on acting:\u201cThe adult actors were supposed to match the kids\u2019 behavior, so they would look at the little quirks they had, or body language things, and try to imitate those\u2014rather than having the kids try to imitate the adults. So I thought that was pretty clever. \u2026 Also, if you\u2019re a fan of Mike Flanagan\u2019s work, all of these actors have appeared in his previous films. The actress who plays Theodora was the main character in Hush, the father was the father in the flashbacks in Gerald\u2019s Game. Even Mrs. Dudley, all of them, if you go back through his previous movies, you\u2019ll recognize them all. So these are all people who have worked together in some capacity for a while now, and are all clearly comfortable working together, and all do a really good job, I thought.\u201dPaul Tremblay on adaptation:\u201cThis is no shade to Flanagan\u2019s TV show, because I think it\u2019s an amazing achievement, but I think part of the reason why The Haunting of Hill House is the haunted house story of the 20th century is that the whole book is really about Eleanor. She\u2019s the one who is haunted\u2014or may not be haunted, because there is some potential ambiguity to it. There are other characters there, but really all of the horror and haunting is reserved for Eleanor, and by the time you get to the end of the novel, it\u2019s really powerful. And obviously it\u2019s difficult, almost impossible, to do that for 10 episodes, where you need\u2014necessarily\u2014more than just one character who\u2019s going to be haunted.\u201dSeth Dickinson on scary houses:\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a secret design I don\u2019t understand, but with the seeming randomness of the supernatural intrusions, I really lost a sense of the house as a coherent menace. \u2026 For me the scariest thing about the house was that when I was a kid, my parents would\u2014over the summer, when I was off school\u2014make me do work on our house, and it was always miserable. I would spend hours painting the eaves, with paint dripping on my face, and I was up on this ladder, sobbing, 20 feet off the ground. So when the series started, and I heard that the hook was \u2018this family with a bunch of kids moves in to refurbish a house,\u2019 I was expecting those kids to have to do grueling manual labor. And they didn\u2019t, at all. Those kids got off really easy.\u201dPaul Tremblay on endings:\u201cHorror doesn\u2019t have to have a nihilistic, depressing ending. You can have an optimistic ending, but for me, in order for that to work, to not feel like sentimentality, that optimism has to be defiant. Take the ending of The Terminator, where Linda Hamilton\u2014even though it\u2019s not a horror movie\u2014but Linda Hamilton is on the side of the road, and the nuclear storm\u2014the machine storm\u2014is coming. And yeah, the world\u2019s going to end, but it\u2019s still weirdly optimistic, or defiantly optimistic, because she\u2019s going to go on and fight, even though she knows everything she knows. \u2026 You have to honor the decisions and experiences that [your characters] have had, and you honor it by showing how they\u2019ve been changed by what they just went through.\u201dDead trees mean dead people, and scientists are finally starting to figure out why. wired.trib.al/zsbdu9qDead trees mean dead people, and scientists are finally starting to figure out why. wired.trib.al/zsbdu9qCNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
