Fantasy author Chandler Klang Smith felt the last episode was weak, but otherwise she loved the show.\u201cThe first nine episodes are my favorite TV drama of all time,\u201d Smith says in Episode 335 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cAnd I would say that even including Episode 10, it\u2019s definitely in my top five.\u201dThe show leans heavily on dream sequences, which range from a Kubrick-inspired first contact scenario to an ultra-violent gangster showdown. That variety of characters and settings strongly appealed to science fiction author Rajan Khanna. \u201cI\u2019m always a sucker for alternate realities, and so it kind of fits into that vein for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe weirder the show was, the more I appreciated it.\u201dBut Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley thought that some of the dream sequences felt out of place.\u201cThe show kind of lost me with Episode 4, where there\u2019s this\u2014it\u2019s sort of like Fargo or something\u2014this lemur kidnapping adventure with gangsters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt very disconnected from the rest of the story up to that point, and I felt like it just wasn\u2019t as interesting to me as the more science fictional, conspiracy stuff that had come before.\u201dScience fiction author Matthew Kressel usually dislikes dream sequences, but found that Maniac ultimately won him over.\u201cNot all of the dreams worked narratively for me, but I really liked that the show was not afraid to use that to tell a story,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I was watching it I was sort of iffy on it, but in retrospect, thinking about it now, I really enjoyed it.\u201dListen to the complete interview with Chandler Klang Smith, Rajan Khanna, and Matthew Kressel in Episode 335 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. Chandler Klang Smith on Patrick Somerville:\u201cI was actually familiar with the writer, Patrick Somerville, who\u2019s the creator of the show, because I reviewed his book The Universe in Miniature in Miniature for the KGB Bar lit mag, back probably the better part of a decade ago, and that book just made a real impression on me. In that book there\u2019s the \u2018Device for Understanding Other People,\u2019 I think it\u2019s called, which in some ways is similar to the technology that\u2019s explored in this show\u2014the idea of a machine or computer that can help you access another person\u2019s consciousness. I just thought that that was a really elegant, moving, memorable work. \u2026 It\u2019s definitely a book that\u2019s worth checking out if you enjoyed Maniac.\u201dMatthew Kressel on mental illness:\u201cI was afraid that they were going to handle mental illness in a bad way. So for example, in Silver Linings Playbook\u2014and I thought most of that film actually handled mental illness really well\u2014but I thought that they destroyed their own setup by basically having the characters live happily ever after at the end. The message of the movie\u2014at least that I took from it, maybe others didn\u2019t\u2014was that all you need is a companion who loves you, and that you love, and then everything will be fine. \u2026 And having people in my life who have suffered through mental illness, I know that\u2019s not the case. You could love someone to death, and they just have bad brain chemistry. \u2026 So I was afraid that would be handled poorly, [and] I was pleasantly surprised.\u201dChandler Klang Smith on AdBuddy:\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s modeled on the way that if you don\u2019t have a subscription to certain websites, then they\u2019ll show you ads, but you can also pay to have those ads removed. It\u2019s that kind of idea carrying over into meatspace. Someone with a briefcase full of ads will follow you around and talk through ads at you. If you can\u2019t pay for basically any product in a store, you can pay for it with an AdBuddy instead. \u2026 So there\u2019s this idea that what we have in our world as an online surveillance and ad culture has been translated into external space, has been literalized, in this really interesting way. I thought that was such a smart idea, a way of commenting on something technological in our own culture but making it visible to us in a new way.\u201dDavid Barr Kirtley on the Statue of Extra Liberty:\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have known this from watching the show, but apparently in this world there\u2019s still the Statue of Liberty, and then looking in a different direction they\u2019ve built another one, the Statue of Extra Liberty\u2014because one Statue of Liberty isn\u2019t enough. In interviews I read they didn\u2019t really explain what the thinking was behind that. The way I read it was that this is such a consumerist world, and there\u2019s so much rhetoric conflating personal freedom with a lack of regulations, that maybe part of the ethos of this world\u2014part of the reason consumerism is so rampant\u2014is because it\u2019s been associated with personal liberty in this really overt way.\u201dSitting 4,400 miles above Jupiter, Nasa's Juno spacecraft took this stunning image of a large anticyclone known as\u2026 twitter.com/i/web/status/1\u2026Sitting 4,400 miles above Jupiter, Nasa's Juno spacecraft took this stunning image of a large anticyclone known as\u2026 twitter.com/i/web/status/1\u2026CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
