He notes that D&D art helped shaped the imagination of an entire generation, lending widespread recognition to formerly obscure monsters such as gryphons, chimeras, and succubi.\u201cIt was really a revolutionary thing, this notion of D&D creating monsters, in many cases from scratch, or in other cases providing sort of the standard visualization of what they would look like,\u201d Witwer says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually one of the biggest things that D&D ever did, was provide us with a standardization of monsters as we understand them.\u201dDespite the massive cultural impact of the game, D&D art has only recently become highly valued. Brian Stillman, co-director of the new film Eye of the Beholder: The Art of Dungeons & Dragons, notes that many early D&D paintings were discarded as trash, or else sold off for small sums to collectors.\u201cThese artists were selling a lot of it at conventions for 40 bucks, 50 bucks,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, the most amazing pieces of art\u2014that sell today for thousands\u2014were just set up at conventions and you\u2019d buy them for whatever\u2019s in your wallet.\u201dAs recently as a few years ago, D&D artists attracted only modest public interest, and interviews with them were scarce. But now that\u2019s changing in a big way, and Stillman hopes his film will help bring their work to an even larger audience. \u201cI joke that the whole point of making this movie was so I could go hang out with all these artists, and get to talk to them, and I might as well hit \u2018record\u2019 on the camera so other people can too,\u201d he says.Listen to the complete interview with Michael Witwer and Brian Stillman in Episode 331 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.Brian Stillman on chainmail bikinis:\u201cWithout really asking [TSR] management, and knowing what they would really cop to, I\u2019d suspect they had to be aware that it was powerful marketing, or they simply wouldn\u2019t have let [the artists] get away with it. They would have just said, \u2018No, redo it.\u2019 Because by then they had art directors in place. I think Clyde Caldwell wanted to paint it, I think Larry Elmore wanted to paint that stuff. They were both really big pin-up artists. And I think management, for all their harumphing\u2014if they cared that much they wouldn\u2019t have let it out there. I think they recognized it was a selling point even as they maybe said, \u2018My gosh, we don\u2019t agree with this at all. Stick it on the cover!'\u201dBrian Stillman on art history:\u201cA couple years ago my wife and I were at the Prado in Spain, and I\u2019m looking at some of the medieval art, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s totally a campaign I ran.\u2019 There\u2019s just no way to look at it and not see the illustrator at work\u2014the illustrative quality\u2014it\u2019s just illustrating religious iconography or the fears of the time. And then you take that into the golden age of illustration\u2014the turn of the century\u2014and you had monsters all over the place. You had all sorts of cool things, and you had fairy tales and things like that. \u2026 But yeah, I think you can trace it back to hundreds of years ago, if you\u2019re just talking about this manifestation of imaginative art, imaginative realism. It just depends on how you want to define the parameters.\u201dMichael Witwer on Tomb of Horrors:\u201cAbout six weeks before [Gary Gygax] left for Baltimore\u2014which is where this Origins tournament took place, where they were going to run this module for about 120 players, with four dungeon masters\u2014Gary came up with this idea that, \u2018Well gosh, if I\u2019ve got four different dungeon masters running the same module, and I\u2019ve got people that haven\u2019t played this game, and it\u2019s a tournament so it\u2019s supposed to be fair and competitive, how do I make sure this is really uniform?\u2019 So he came up with this idea of creating panels that he could show players, and that he could distribute among the four dungeon masters, so that they could have visual uniformity about what they saw and what they experienced.\u201dMichael Witwer on Dave Trampier:\u201cTrampier was not, on a technical level, the most gifted artist. He didn\u2019t have the greatest training. But he clearly was trying to paint the music in his head. You can see it in everything he did. The ambition of what he was trying to do was extraordinary. If you\u2019ve never seen the wrap-around cover for the dungeon master screen that Trampier did, it is unbelievably cinematic. It is as great as any movie poster you would have seen in the early \u201980s. Now again, execution wasn\u2019t necessarily his strong suit, because he wasn\u2019t as trained as some of these later artists. But when you look at the things he was trying to do, you don\u2019t have to look very far to see that this guy was a genius.\u201dDead trees mean dead people, and scientists are finally starting to figure out why. wired.trib.al/zsbdu9qDead trees mean dead people, and scientists are finally starting to figure out why. wired.trib.al/zsbdu9qCNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
