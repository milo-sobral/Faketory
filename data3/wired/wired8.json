If you were wondering about that, here\u2019s a great chance to learn a little bit more about Sharp and make the call yourself. During the 25th anniversary festival for WIRED last week, the Gadget Lab team had the chance to interview Sharp on stage, among other high-profile technologists. Over the next few weeks we\u2019ll be publishing these taped conversations as a part of the podcast. In this interview, Mike and Arielle ask Sharp what it\u2019s like to receive praise from Ive, how machine learning is changing software design, and whether Pinterest can remain once of the internet\u2019s last happy places.
