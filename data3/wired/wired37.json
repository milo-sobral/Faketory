Just as predictably, the LeBron James era kicked off with a trio of losses\u2014what, according to critics, is expected to be the first of many. As a three-time NBA champion and seven-time MVP, James is among the most dominant players to grace the hardwood. Still, for the first time in nearly a decade, his supernova talents likely won't be enough to catapult his team into the finals.What is less questionable this season, however, is James\u2019 off-court presence. He has just as effectively proven to be the rare multi-hyphenate athlete whose impact extends well beyond the league\u2014it\u2019s LeBron as activist, philanthropist, and emergent business titan. In moving to LA as part of a much-ballyhooed four-year, $154-million deal, James fully positions himself as an enterprise of change, a one-man orbit whose aspirations signal a new kind of moguldom for athletes: one centered on social good.Nike, Colin Kaepernick, and the Changing Role of the AthleteHow The Best Jumpers in the World Fly So Damn HighWatch a Sporty AI Teach Itself to Dribble Better Than YouNearly since his entrance into the NBA in 2003, James has moved with the eyes of the crowd on his back. He\u2019s a populist, if decisive, figure who has done more to shape the league, and the image of its athletes, than just about any player: rekindling the superteam era by joining Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade on the Miami Heat in 2010; testing our understanding of the athlete-activist by wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt to honor Eric Garner in 2014; calling President Trump a \u201cbum\u201d on Twitter last year for using sports as a dividing force instead of a unifying one.Each of those actions has come after careful consideration; for an athlete who makes in excess of $50 million yearly from endorsements, voicing conviction is always a calculation. For James, though, legacy has always trumped risk. And in signing with the Lakers, besieged as they are by unrealized potential, he made the ultimate legacy play, one that stands to immortalize him while also solidifying his footprint as an influential Hollywood executive.When James founded production company SpringHill Entertainment with his childhood friend Maverick Carter in 2015, the original idea was to leverage the athlete's star power from behind the camera; a move that would allow the company to slowly find its own identity outside James magnetism. Early on, though, SpringHill safely flirted with sports biography: including a prize-winning documentary about James\u2019s high school days, More than a Game, and I Am Giant, which chronicled the trials of former NFL wide receiver Victor Cruz. Even scripted shows, like Showtime sitcom Survivor\u2019s Remorse, paralleled James\u2019 rise out of adversity to basketball phenom.What\u2019s on tap for SpringHill in the coming year, though, seems more in line with James evolving, socially-conscious moguldom. In addition to HBO\u2019s The Shop\u2014an unscripted series where James and his famous friends (Odell Beckham Jr, Snoop Dogg, Drake, and Candace Parker among them) confab in a barbershop about adulthood, racial expectations, and more\u2014the company is currently developing a limited-series starring Octavia Spencer as Madame C.J. Walker, the first black woman millionaire (it was acquired by Netflix); a documentary about the controversial champion boxer Muhammad Ali; Lean On Me, a CW drama inspired by the 1989 film that follows a young educator trying to \u201ctransform a failing campus into an urban oasis;\u201d and a three-part HBO documentary about the athlete\u2019s role in the political sphere titled Shut Up and Dribble. (The company also has shows in development with NBC, Starz, and Facebook.)It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when James had his political awakening. He was raised in a single-parent, paycheck-to-paycheck household in Akron, so it\u2019s likely he\u2019s always understood the weight of his skin, and the consequence it carries in America. But as his foray into television and film has continued, each project has functioned as a conduit, even a conversation starter, for larger messages around race, politics, and social justice. Within each of these undertakings is a push for wider representation, a calculated gamble that seeks disruption and balance behind and in front of the screen.James\u2019s growing reach, of course, extends past these projects\u2014he\u2019s reportedly in talks to produce a Friday the 13th reboot\u2014and even past the glint of Hollywood. This summer, in July, he opened the first I Promise educational facility in a bid to revolutionize public education. An Akron-based non-charter school that plans to do more than just educate students, its offers what administrators refer to as \u201cwraparound\u201d services\u2014each student is supplied with a Chromebook and a bicycle, has access to the school\u2019s pantry, is provided with job and family services, tutors, as well as emotional and psychological services. All graduates are guaranteed free tuition to the University of Akron beginning in 2021. \u201cWhen people ask me why a school, it\u2019s because I know exactly what these 240 kids are going through,\u201d James said in a speech during the school\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cI\u2019ve been there.\u201dIncreasingly, as players have invested in outside entities\u2014most noticeably, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant  made a series of investments in Silicon Valley startups, following the lead of his teammate Andre Iguodala\u2014James has continually bet on himself. It reminds me of what he said during his I Promise speech: about having been there. Having accrued the experience to know what it would eventually take to make a lasting imprint. It\u2019s about opportunity and representation. It\u2019s perhaps James\u2019 most vital lesson, the one that will define his legacy: In trying to change a system, he built\u2014and became\u2014his own.From what shots are the most efficient to how defenders alter offense in the post to placing a value on every action on the court, they\u2019re helping bring hoops into the big data era.
