It\u2019s a picture of himself emblazoned with the phrase \u201cSanctions Are Coming\u201d in a typeface not that dissimilar from the one used in the Game of Thrones logo along with the date \u201cNovember 5.\u201d Subtle, it was not.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1058388700617498625As soon as it went up, and as soon as it was clarified by the White House that the sanctions in question were indeed the ones that had been relaxed during the Obama administration and which Trump had been seeking to reimpose, Twitter went nuts. Folks began responding with memes of their own\u2014\u201dIndictments Are Coming\u201d etc.\u2014and even the show\u2019s cast got involved. Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, replied \u201cEw,\u201d and Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), in perhaps the best Twitter drag of the day, retweeted the president and just added \u201cNot today.\u201d (\u201cNot today,\u201d for those who don\u2019t remember, is what Arya Stark\u2019s swordfighting instructor, Syrio Forel, told her is what she should say to the god of death.)Then HBO got in on the action, sending out a tweet reading, \u201cHow do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?\u201d Reached for comment the network added, \u201cWe were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.\u201d Trump evoking the show\u2019s logo and slogan, it seems, doesn\u2019t sit very well with the people who actually make the show.But could the network or creators successfully sue? Probably not. First off, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that HBO actually wants to make a legal claim of trademark infringement. At most, the network is playing along. Trump referenced the show; they responded. Simple as that. But the response, and subsequent online chatter, did raise some questions about whether or not the president went too far.Most likely, he didn\u2019t.Trump's Plan to Redefine Gender Makes No Scientific SenseThe Internet Defines 'Covfefe'Trump's Auto Emissions Plan Is Full of Faulty LogicIf HBO were to bring a claim, it would probably be for what\u2019s known as trademark dilution, says Daniel Nazer, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s intellectual property team. Typically, these are the kinds of claims companies make when they feel their very-famous trademarks are being used in ways that deplete the uniqueness, or dilute, their intended message. A company can\u2019t, say, put something that looks like the Nike \u201cswoosh\u201d logo on the side of a commercial plane or use \u201cJust do it.\u201d to sell condoms.A dilution claim also generally requires that the entity claiming infringement be able to prove the public was genuinely confused. Because Trump\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t being used in commerce, and because it\u2019s unlikely anyone thought he was legit affiliated with Game of Thrones, dilution would be a hard argument to make. \"I think this would be a tough, a tough case,\" Nazer says. \"No one is likely to be confused that HBO is endorsing this tweet or sponsoring sanctions against Iran. My view is that this shouldn\u2019t be a viable suit.\"Instead, Nazer says, Trump\u2019s tweet would be treated more like a parody\u2014legally speaking. If, for example, Saturday Night Live did a sketch about waiting for a train in New York titled \u201cThe G Train Is Coming\u201d that pokes fun at MTA tardiness and references Game of Thrones, that\u2019s not an infringing use. (It\u2019s also a funny idea, SNL. Please make that sketch and credit Nazer.) As for Trump\u2019s use of the Thrones font, the files used in typefaces can be protected, as is (presumably) the actual logo, but because Trump just uses a script that looks like the GoT emblem, the image the president tweeted is likely not infringing. It\u2019s ironic, but the bottom line is that the man who likes to take shots at the media is protected here by the First Amendment.The bottom line is that the man who likes to take shots at the media is protected here by the First Amendment.The parody aspect, though, is compelling, because the metaphor doesn\u2019t quite align. In Game of Thrones, \u201cwinter is coming\u201d is a call to remain vigilant, and a warning that White Walkers could come and threaten the living when winter arrives. Yet winter has been coming on the show since the pilot; it\u2019s a slow march that\u2019s taken seven years. Trump\u2019s \u201cNovember 5\u201d warning promises something he intends to do in a matter of days. Also, one presumes, Trump thinks the sanctions are a good idea, but the coming of winter in Game of Thrones is something most sane people in Westeros fear. It\u2019s possible Trump wants Iran to be afraid of the sanctions, but the wordplay still doesn\u2019t quite land.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of riffing on it, but it\u2019s hard to know what the satirical or parodic intent is here,\u201d Nazer says. \u201cWinter in the Game of Thrones universe is kind of terrible, so I\u2019m not sure if they really thought it through. There\u2019s probably nothing much beyond it looks cool.\u201dHalf an idea without any sense of its viability? Sounds about right.In the aftermath of the US elections, documentary photographer Guy Martin travelled to Veles, Macedonia to find out why this small town became the heart of the fake news scandal.
