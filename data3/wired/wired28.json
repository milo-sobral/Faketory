They fuse. You get an embryo, and it\u2019s destined to be male or female.So, not so simple.Sex (broadly, the biology of reproduction) and gender (broadly, one\u2019s sense of self as masculine, feminine, neither, or both) fit neatly into precisely no strict definitions\u2014unless, of course, you are making policy for the Trump Administration, which has for two years been trying to define gender identity out of civil rights protections. The binary distinction between two sexes that are also two genders has held throughout human history, goes this philosophy\u2014a hard and fast (if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into) split.According to The New York Times this weekend, the US Department of Health and Human Services is planning on going even further. The agency is preparing a memo to be promulgated throughout the administration defining \u201csex\u201d under Title IX, the civil rights law against gender discrimination in education, \u201con a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective, and administratable.\u201d Furthermore, the Times reported, that basis would be grounded in a person\u2019s genitals at birth, with disputes resolved by genetic testing. \u201cSex means a person\u2019s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth,\u201d the Times\u2019 quote continued. \u201cThe sex listed on a person\u2019s birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person\u2019s sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.\u201dIt seems important to be clear at this juncture: That is not going to work. At all.Genes carried by a sperm and an egg are packaged into bundles called chromosomes, and depending on whether the sperm was ferrying one of a pair of chromosomes designated \u201cX\u201d or \u201cY,\u201d the resulting embryo will develop with every cell carrying two Xs or an X and a Y. Generally\u2014generally\u2014XX means female, a woman, a vulva-and-ovaries-and-uterus haver. The XY means male, a penis-and-testes-and-prostate haver. It\u2019s the circle of sex life.But a lot can happen on the road from embryogenesis to personhood. Sometimes the fusion of egg and sperm goes differently. People can be XXX, XXY, or XYY with no physiological indications. People can have some XX cells and some XY cells. Sometimes a person can be XX but have \u201cmale\u201d physiognomy, or the other way \u2019round. Sometimes, to the tune of one in a hundred, a baby is born with genitalia that people in the room can\u2019t agree on. In some cases physicians perform surgery on those children to assign a sex, and that sex doesn\u2019t always align with how that person sees themself as an adult. The X chromosome has genes for making sperm! A gene called SRY triggers a complex developmental pathway that usually leads to a person being male, but not always! All sorts of nominal sex differences\u2014size of various brain regions, hormone levels, socioemotional development, personality, affinities\u2014work on average and fall apart upon closer statistical investigation. Basically no scientist who knows anything about this stuff subscribes to the idea of the strict \u201cgender binary\u201d anymore.Some adults\u2014perhaps 2 million Americans, by one estimate\u2014transition from one gender to another. Some adults feel altogether nonbinary, which is to say, they don\u2019t identify as either fully masculine or feminine, completely apart from whatever their biology suggests.Are most people mostly one way? Sure. External genitals, internal genitals, sex chromosomes, ability to make a baby, levels of certain hormones\u2014they\u2019re all useful physiological markers of sex and gender, but they don\u2019t say anything about social influences, and they ain\u2019t the end of the story. \u201cIn a number of cases, these parameters are not going to be congruent with each other. They\u2019re not going to be all male or all female,\u201d says Eric Vilain, a pediatrician and geneticist at George Washington University who studies sex differentiation. \u201cThat\u2019s the complexity of biology. There\u2019s no one biological marker.\u201d Sex and gender, am I right? We humans are blessed to live in a world of infinite variety.The Trump administration\u2019s wish for scientific clarity is not going to come true. \u201cWhat genetic test?\u201d Vilain asks. \u201cThere is not one simple genetic test that says your sex is male or your sex is female.\u201dGroups that represent trans people, nonbinary people, and intersex people immediately saw the problem. That new policy would expose them to even more harassment and discrimination than they already get, and essentially define them out of legal existence. It\u2019s not the first attempt: The Trump administration withdrew an Obama-era guidance on the treatment of transgender students in school. The Department of Justice rescinded an earlier assessment that gender identity is covered under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which covers employment discrimination. Health and Human Services has indicated it wants to revise Section 1557, the civil rights piece of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhat\u2019s new about this memo is not only a reaffirmation of that position, but also the assertion that the government has the right to define what sex someone is based on narrow and constrained assessment that flies in the face of both the law and science about the nature of gender,\u201d says Jocelyn Samuels, executive director of the Williams Institute at UCLA, which specializes in gender and the law. \u201cIt not only threatens transgender people but constitutes a real invasion of privacy for anyone.\u201dA few states and cities have been trying to get out in front of this kind of redefinition. This year, New York City started allowing people to make a third choice other than \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d on their driver licenses, and adults or children with permission of their legal guardian can have their birth certificates revised to indicate the sex with which they identify rather than the one they were born with. \u201cIf someone has a birth certificate that has a gender marker not in harmony with how they\u2019re presenting or how they identify, it outs them as trans to their employer, their health care provider,\u201d says Ashe McGovern, director of the NYC Unity Project. Revising the birth certificate, they say, \u201cgives trans and nonbinary people the autonomy and self-determination of when and how they come out to people who have significant control over their lives.\u201dNew York isn\u2019t alone here. California, Maine, Oregon, Washington DC, and Washington State all have similar laws and protections against gender discrimination. Normally a change in federal policy wouldn\u2019t preempt those laws\u2014federal civil rights protections are typically considered to be a \u201cfloor\u201d not a \u201cceiling\u201d \u2026 unless the federal rules go totally in the other direction. Redefining gender identity as an unprotected category might constitute such a change. Nobody really knows yet. \u201cWhether a court would say that a state law that allows people to change their birth certificates based on something other than their genitalia was more protective, I would argue that it was, but it might depend,\u201d says Samuels, who used to run the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights.Similarly, nobody knows whether compelling a genetic test, arguably without consent, would be a violation of the US Constitution\u2019s 4th amendment protections against illegal search and seizure. \u201cThat would take a hell of a lot more analysis and study, but it certainly raises serious red flags to think that the government would subject someone to a genetic test before they could assert their rights to be free from harassment in school,\u201d Samuels says. \u201cThe notion that the government will dictate someone is what it says on their birth certificate unless they show genetic evidence to the contrary is unprecedented.\u201dSamuels says that existing law and precedent all lean toward accepting that gender identity, including trans, nonbinary, and intersex, is a category that can be protected under laws against sex discrimination. One recent court case says otherwise\u2014a 2017 ruling out of a federal court in Texas found that it was OK to discriminate against transgender people getting healthcare on religious grounds.In these kinds of situations, where it\u2019s unclear how state and federal law should be reconciled, or whether a federal law is constitutional, recourse is generally the courts. That\u2019s true, too, in all the other states that don\u2019t have specific civil rights protections based on gender identity. And those courts are changing. President Trump has appointed more than 80 federal judges. At least one analysis suggests that newly seated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has little interest in expanding 4th Amendment protections.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services called the Times\u2019 story \u201cmisleading\u201d and emailed the following: \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s broad definition of \u2018sex\u2019 was enjoined by a federal court on a nationwide basis in December 2016 and the Obama administration did not appeal. That court found that the Obama administration regulation was overbroad and inconsistent with the text of the 1972 Title IX law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The court order remains in full force and effect today and HHS is bound by it as we continue to review the issue. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights will continue to vigorously enforce all laws as written and passed by Congress, prohibiting discrimination in healthcare on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, and disability.\u201dThe unprecedented part of the change in policy that the Times covered and HHS denies, then, is how that memo talks about science. This administration seems awfully concerned with biology as it might apply to race and sex, and yet utterly unconcerned by how it applies to, for example, air and water pollution or how a warming planet affects living things.In fields as disparate as drug approvals, environmental regulations, or determinations of mining rights, various agencies have evinced a desire to use only rigorous science to set policy\u2014but then largely ignored that science where it was available or insisted that the science was solid when it wasn\u2019t. (A notable outlier here is climate change, where the administration denies good science is available even though it is.)Of course, I can think of one way to convince oneself that the gender binary is settled science: Categorize everyone outside those boundaries as having a disorder, either mental or physical. If only binary gender is normal, everything else is a disorder\u2014something to be \u201cfixed\u201d with surgery or electroshock or, I don\u2019t know, gene therapy. The Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to make gender identity something totally cool to discriminate against are an attempt to use medical pseudoscience as a cudgel against autonomy. The postmodernists of the 1980s were wrong about a lot, but when they said \u201cthe political is personal,\u201d this is what they meant: policy as literal bloodsport.And it\u2019s fundamentally weird, isn\u2019t it? All of us build multiple identities on the internet free of physical limitation. We get told (lie or not) that nothing bounds our personal potential except psychological freight. Except, no no no, the particular conformations of our bodies are, in fact, destiny\u2014and not even our whole bodies, just the shapes of the parts between our legs and maybe our upper chest. If those are your politics, reproduction, sex, and gender may well seem quite simple, after all.Maybe you've heard of Crispr, the gene editing tool that could forever change life.
