He and his brother Logan (who infamously filmed a dead body in Japan\u2019s Aokigahara forest earlier this year) leave chaos and scandal in their wake online and off. Jake, especially, is douchebagus americanus var. bro, one of the most hated people on YouTube, but only according to people over the age of 16. To a devoted audience of tweens, he is their universe.Enter Shane Dawson, a YouTube megastar in his own right, but one with a decade on Jake Paul\u2014both in age and experience. At 30, he\u2019s YouTube\u2019s elder statesman, and his channel reflects the growth that comes with age.  It\u2019s morphed from a composite of silly (sometimes racist) sketches, to an equally dark period of making \u201ccakes\u201d out of oozing piles of fast food to what it\u2019s become in the last three months: a vehicle for YouTube\u2019s version of investigative reporting, complete with multipart documentaries deep-diving into the lives of YouTube\u2019s most controversial stars. He\u2019s profiled people like Jeffree Star and Tana Mongeau, with the kind of access only Dawson is likely to get. Whenever Dawson\u2019s videos drop, they make YouTube stand still and gawp\u2014they get millions and millions of views, inspire both positive and negative reaction videos, and generate more conversation than almost anything else on YouTube, except maybe the Paul brothers.So when Dawson announced his next subject would be Jake Paul, the backlash was instantaneous, and thunderous. The series, which culminated this week in an almost two hour final episode, has more than 100 million views altogether.The documentary is by turns engrossing and exhausting, sharp and extremely silly, clear eyed and disturbingly blinkered. It\u2019s central question is at once a focused interrogation (Is Jake Paul a sociopath? And if he is, are all YouTubers?) and an existential crisis (Who made Jake Paul? Who even is Jake Paul?). Through this meandering gaze the series tackles America\u2019s thorniest cultural issues, from the outrage-driven tendency to outcast social media celebrities after a scandal to casual racism and toxic masculinity\u2014 while acknowledging Dawson\u2019s own place in the attention-seeking streaming ecosystem.\u201cListen, I get it, okay? I shouldn\u2019t be doing this. I shouldn\u2019t be giving Jake Paul a platform,\u201d Dawson says in the first episode. \u201cBut I also want to be doing shit on my channel that I find interesting.\u201dThat ambivalence and helpless self-reproach characterizes the entire series, especially the finale, where Shane and the audience sit down and listen to Jake Paul speak his version of the truth for an hour, like a low budget version of The Bachelor\u2019s \u201cAfter the Final Rose.\u201dAiring this direct interaction is a radical action. By social media law, Jake Paul\u2019s extremely bad behavior, which includes imperiling neighbors by setting giant fires and making racist and xenophobic jokes regularly, and directly impacts millions of preteens, has gotten him \u201ccanceled\u201d\u2014social media parlance for being made a pariah, a tactic designed to starve a problem person of oxygen. That law applies to the rarified world of YouTube celebrities most of all: Later in the series, Paul says that he feels like \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d at YouTube creator events because people pretend he isn\u2019t there. By talking about and to Paul, Dawson is stepping outside YouTube\u2019s norms, and the viewer joins him by watching. Everyone knows it\u2019s not quite right to ignore him and even worse to give him attention, but that makes it harder to look away.The documentary\u2019s main confusion\u2014if Paul is a pariah, are we all making our own culture worse by turning our attention to him?\u2014is also the great question of the internet. The norms well-intentioned commenters try to enforce, that decency should trump shock value, aren\u2019t the norms at all. But by trying to enforce them, these mobs so consistently make their object of outrage the beneficiary of attention that stoking scandal has become a norm of its own. You can talk about how unacceptable Jake Paul\u2019s brand of violent, merch-peddling, wealth flexing bro-ness is, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is accepted and celebrated by millions daily, which in turn wins him brand deals and sponsorships from corporate America.What he\u2019s supposed to be doing, though, is toxic. Even, as the documentary makes clear, for him. Which brings us to another uncomfortable question raised in Dawson\u2019s finale: Should we feel bad for Jake Paul? His family is dysfunctional, and a crucial part of their dysfunction is putting their whole lifes, and especially all their dirty laundry, on the internet forever. (I am haunted by an exchange by between Jake and his father, known of YouTube as Vlogdad Greg Paul. \u201cThe secret service is at my house! What does that mean?\u201d Jake asked, wild-eyed. \u201cIt means you\u2019re making good vlog content,\u201d his dad replies.) For Jake Paul, a high school dropout living with about a dozen twenty somethings in a giant house with no rules, he\u2019s essentially self-publishing a reality television show about his freshman year of college, with a rabid and instantaneous audience of millions.It\u2019s clear that Dawson sympathizes and identifies with Jake Paul. But from the outside, it feels important not to. Dawson doesn\u2019t hold Paul\u2019s hands to the fire about other issues crucial to internet culture\u2019s current discourse. Paul alleged dragged a woman down a flight of stairs after smashing her phone. Paul openly called a pair of Spanish twins that were part of his crew of vloggers a racial slur for Mexicans\u2014constantly. He says he doesn\u2019t make those jokes anymore because he\u2019s afraid to, not because he knows his behavior was wrong. (Dawson responded that he had gotten in trouble for making racist jokes too.)It\u2019s a documentary whose faults are the same as its virtues.  But for all its faults, Dawson\u2019s series is one that prints itself in your brain\u2014not because it\u2019s shocking to peer into the bleak, glamorous life of Jake Paul, but because it isn\u2019t. You may not feel as akin to Paul as Dawson does, but you will recognize him.CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
