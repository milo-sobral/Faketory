To beat the congestion, many residents have turned to the city\u2019s fleet of motorbike taxis, known as boda-bodas; hundreds of thousands of such taxis are currently in operation, and their numbers continue to swell. With so much competition, the struggle to get customers is a fierce one, and so many boda-boda drivers decorate their bikes in eye-catching themes.During a recent visit to the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Dutch photographer Jan Hoek noticed a particularly creative boda-boda driver who had customized his bike to resemble the one driven by Nicholas Cage in the 2007 film Ghost Rider, based on the Marvel Comics character. There was only one thing missing: a matching costume. To remedy that fault, Hoek teamed up with Ugandan fashion designer Bobbin Case to create outfits for seven of the most creative boda-boda drivers in Nairobi.The Techies Turning Kenya Into a Silicon SavannahLoon's Internet-Slinging Balloons Are Headed to Work Over KenyaSomeone Finally Mapped Cape Town's Bewildering Taxi NetworkIn addition to the Ghost Rider, they recruited drivers with bikes inspired by Mad Max: Fury Road, the Danny Trejo film Machete, the Manchester United soccer team, and the Jamaican musician Vybz Kartel; there was also a dreadlocked driver with a Rastafari-themed motorbike. After interviewing the drivers about what they wanted in a costume, Case spent two months fabricating the outfits from scratch. Some of the drivers had special requests. The Rasta-inspired driver, for instance, wanted holes in his helmet so his locks could poke through.\u201cIn all my work, I think it\u2019s really important that the subject is also a collaborator,\u201d Hoek says. \u201cWhat we were asking them to do was just a next step from what they were already doing, so for most of them it felt really natural.\u201dHoek photographed the riders in locations around Nairobi in the early morning, when the light was gentler and the roads were relatively clear. After the shoot, the drivers kept their costumes. Hoek has learned that the Machete driver hung his outfit up in his home like an artwork, and that the Mad Max driver sold his to a fellow boda-boda operator. The other drivers continue wearing various elements of their costumes while speeding around Nairobi.\u201cWe always hoped that they would get more customers because of the costumes,\u201d Hoek says. \u201cAnd we wanted to set a trend in Nairobi so that more motorbikers will dress up this way.\u201dShot mostly in Africa with real vehicles and complex stunts, \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d brings a high intensity to the post-apocalyptic franchise.
