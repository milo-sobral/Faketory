{"id": "Making a Stormtrooper Out of Bodies Is Easier Than You'd ThinkMaking a Stormtrooper Out of Bodies Is Easier Than You'd Think", "paragraph": "If the work of Pilobolus looks familiar, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve seen them on the Oscars. Or on YouTube. Though the dance troupe was founded in 1971 at Dartmouth College, the group\u2019s most recent spate of notoriety comes from its projected shadow play routines, multi-person performances done behind a screen that give the illusion that multiple bodies have morphed into animals, plants, and other objects.Ever since Pilobolus started doing the shadow routines, they\u2019ve gotten massive amounts of attention: trips to The Oprah Winfrey Show, work in car commercials, and\u2014yes\u2014a gig acting out the Best Picture nominees at the 79th Academy Awards. In 2009, they launched an entire Shadowland show, all based on the shapes people could act out with their bodies and maybe a few stretch-y pieces of clothing.\"Limitations are awesome for creativity,\" says Renee Jaworski, one of Pilobolus\u2019 artistic directors \"They are super helpful, because if the world is your oyster then it\u2019s really hard to make a decision. But when there are limitations there are rules and you work within those rules and suddenly you have to be creative to bend those rules and push the boundaries of what is possible in that world.\"Recently, WIRED put that creativity to the test and asked Jaworski\u2019s dancers to do a lightning round, creating shadow formations on the spot based on images we gave them. The best one they pulled off? A Star Wars stormtrooper. After a little bit of plotting they got it all\u2014the shape of the helmet, those angular eyes, that menacing grill. Pilobolus makes it look easy, but it\u2019s actually just the result of years of practice. \u201cYou have to be willing to fail,\u201d says Matt Kent, another of the troupe\u2019s artistic directors, \"that\u2019s our guard against mediocrity.\"Watch Pilobolus create a shadow stormtrooper and many more inspired shapes in the video above.Former Chief of Disguise for the CIA, Jonna Mendez, explains how disguises are used in the CIA, and what aspects to the deception make for an effective disguise.\nYou can watch new episodes of WIRED MASTERMINDS on your smart TV.\nhttps://www.wired.com/brandlab/2018/06/wired-smart-tv-app-new-way-watch-wired/CNMN Collection\u00a9 2018 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
