{"id": "On the eve of the Saudi economic summit, we\u2019re about to see just how damaged they are in Silicon Valley", "paragraph": "The Saudi economic summit that begins on Tuesday will be nothing like last year\u2019s inaugural Saudi summit.The sheen has worn off of the Future Investment Initiative, which was visualized as a new kind of international finance conference that would take what has succeeded for decades in Davos as the World Economic Forum and bring it to the desert of Riyadh. But after the now-admitted killing of American resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi earlier this month, the event has transformed from a star-studded gala into a scarlet letter in the eyes of Silicon Valley.The three-day conference has been close to decimated by cancellations from Western speakers as details emerged about Khashoggi\u2019s gruesome death. And now the Saudis will have to stomach global scrutiny that will be critical of too many all-is-fine smiles from attendees or too few mea culpas from government officials.Here\u2019s what to watch for as \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d begins:Remarkably, on the eve of the conference, we still do not have a final tally of which Silicon Valley names are still planning to appear. That\u2019s probably the point.\u201cThe detailed program will be released shortly,\u201d read the conference\u2019s website as of Tuesday morning in Saudi Arabia. Controversial investor and Facebook board member Peter Thiel is still listed as sitting on the conference\u2019s advisory board \u2014 even as other Silicon Valley members like media mogul Arianna Huffington have pulled their endorsement.The biggest unanswered question, though, is whether Masayoshi Son, the leader of SoftBank, will snub the event. Son is the Silicon Valley name with the most substantial business ties to the Saudis \u2014 $45 billion through their joint investing effort, the Vision Fund \u2014 and SoftBank has said very little about the unfolding situation in its backer\u2019s borders.SoftBank has been mum about its executives\u2019 plans \u2014 a spokesperson didn\u2019t reply on Monday when asked about Son\u2019s plans. But the business world will be closely watching what he says, and more importantly, if he appears at all.* Update: Son is no longer speaking at the conference, per The Wall Street Journal.The high-profile names attending a conference, though, are only really meaningful if they tell us something about whether the Saudis will be really hurt in the pocketbook. Unwinding past deals is close to impossible. But future deals? There are early signs that the Saudis are losing the U.S. business they have tried so hard to cultivate \u2014 from a $400 million investment into the Hollywood talent agency Endeavor to $1 billion into Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group.I wonder whether the Saudis will pretend if all is normal, or will instead recognize that their brand in the deal community has been seriously tarnished.It\u2019s not only startups that take in mouthfuls of Saudi cash over the last few years \u2014 venture capital firms do, too.Everyone knows about how Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund has backed companies like Uber. But Saudi funds are always trying to get access to top-tier funds. One that has been somewhat successful, for instance, is the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, the $20 billion endowment that is an investor in a number of top funds, according to one person familiar with the arrangement.If you\u2019re a Silicon Valley investor in October 2018, it\u2019s hard to believe that you\u2019d feel comfortable taking money from any Saudi-backed fund.\u201cNot all money is the same. The people that come with it and who are behind it matter,\u201d wrote venture capitalist Fred Wilson on his well-read blog this weekend. \u201cThat has always been the case and remains the case and we are reminded of it from time to time. Like right now.\u201dThe problem? In October 2020 or October 2022, when the Khashoggi scandal has faded into history, investors won\u2019t be reminded of it. And the Saudi summits could get very popular again.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
