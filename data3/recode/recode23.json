{"id": "Full Q&A: \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 co-star Sean Hayes on Recode Decode", "paragraph": "On the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, \u201cWill & Grace\u201d actor Sean Hayes talked about how he became a producer after the show ended, why the cast reunited for multiple new seasons on NBC, and how the rise of digital platforms like Amazon and Netflix aren\u2019t as different from traditional players as people might assume.\u201cThese are the new networks,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Everything is exactly the same. Everything is ... They make deals with people. People are going to these streaming companies because they can do with their creative freedom, the deals are better, there\u2019s more ownership, you can swear, you can tell real stories. A network is a dinosaur business because they have to rely on the affiliate still and advertising and that they are limiting because you have to watch what you say and do.\u201dThis interview was recorded live at the Boomtown Brewery in Los Angeles, at a Recode event sponsored by ZipRecruiter.You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Sean.Kara Swisher: But tonight, we have a really great guy I\u2019ve known for quite a while and I think he\u2019s one of the funniest people I know. But he\u2019s also pretty ... He\u2019s beyond what you think he is. He\u2019s obviously famous from \u201cWill and Grace\u201d and he\u2019s over there doing his emails because he\u2019s also a Hollywood producer.Sean Hayes: No, I just find you fascinating. I find you fascinating.I know that, thank you. Sean is one of the smartest people in Hollywood, thinking about where things are going in the digital age too, and so we\u2019re going to talk about the show. We\u2019re going to talk about his career and a little bit about the things he\u2019s doing, including he\u2019s doing some investments and different things like that. So, Sean Hayes, get up here. Thanks. Thanks, everybody. Thank you so much. It\u2019s such a pleasure to be here with you.Is it? Yeah, here. And you said you didn\u2019t know how to get here to this part of town. Well, gay people wear glasses.Yes, I know, we do. We like them. And black, too.And what? Black outfits.Black, yeah.Exactly.Well, yeah. Something like that. Hi, everybody.Hi. So, you didn\u2019t know this area of town, right? You were like, \u201cWhat the hell is ...\u201dI did, I never come down here, and you realize that when you drive downtown Los Angeles that it really is like a whole other cool vibe that I\u2019m not nearly cool enough for.Right, so you stay over on the west side.I stay on the nerd side, yeah.The nerd side, okay. So, let me talk a little bit about a lot of things, including \u201cWill and Grace\u201d and other things like that.That works out perfect ...That works out perfect because you\u2019re there on \u201cWill and Grace.\u201d... because I\u2019m here.But I do want to get into the idea of what you do because you do things well beyond. And I think I was surprised by how much producing you do and things. So, it\u2019s really important. First let\u2019s talk about your background because I ask everyone about their background. You came from Illinois.Illinois.Yeah, Illinois. And you grew up in a small town? Yeah, I grew up in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, it\u2019s a suburb of Chicago. Dad left when I was 5. Mom raised five kids by herself. So ...And dad left? The reason, you mean?Yeah.Wanted to drink and wanted to party. And I was like, \u201cThat sounds like a great idea, but I\u2019m 5.\u201d Yes, right. Okay.\u201dWish I could join you.\u201d My mom was extraordinary, but she worked all the time, but she was still a great mom, as great as she could be. So, we kind of parented ourselves.What did she do?She had the option when my dad left to have a secretarial kind of position or start a nonprofit organization feeding the poor and the homeless with a nun friend of hers.Okay.And that\u2019s what she chose. And all of us were like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t take Door No. 2 which would\u2019ve paid for food in our mouths.\u201d Right, right.But we always got a couple ... We were one of those families that needed the food.Right. So, she did the right thing. For 25 years, she helped run a food bank called Northern Illinois Food Bank which is part of Second Harvest, which is the bigger thing. I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s heard of that.And then raised five kids at the same time.And then raised five kids, yeah.So, you\u2019re saying you raised yourself.Well, we parented ourselves. We had to learn how to ... We kind of weren\u2019t ... We didn\u2019t treat each other great because we were hurting, so that we hurt sometimes. But we also laughed a whole lot. And then the older we got, there was a lot of drinking in our house. Our house was the cool house where all the kids came over to drink and hang out. And I just wanted to sleep and practice my piano.Okay, all right. And your brothers and sisters, what did they end up doing? My oldest brother, no idea what he does, something in a warehouse. My second-oldest brother, I have no clue. My third-oldest brother, no idea. And my sister ... Because they start talking over the phone, I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWell, we do this stuff in the warehouse where they keep track of ...\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t keep track, I can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d So, my sister was ...You speak to them still? I do, yeah. Yes. You know, we all have different relationships with everybody, but I\u2019m probably closest with my sister. She\u2019s the most emotionally available and so that\u2019s where I lived as well, around the corner.In that emotionally available part of the corner, yeah. Yeah. Try to. And she was a cop in Glen Ellyn, where the scariest thing is somebody\u2019s bike gets stolen.Right. And then she moved to Wisconsin and is now ... working at a place. It\u2019s a waste of time.All right. Okay. We\u2019ll ask her.I could tell you what it is if you really want to know.Yes, I really want to know! Okay. So, she works at a place, it does two things in the same office. They sell stationery and they sell the equipment that kills farm animals.Okay. Yeah.Same thing.Like they cut off the balls of, you know, cows and such. Really? That\u2019s what she does?She doesn\u2019t do that, she sells the equipment for it. How does the stationery get ... I understand that cutting off balls part, but how does the stationery become part of that?I have no idea.Okay, but they do.That\u2019s what they do. The same company does that.All right. So how did you get out of this place? That\u2019s really the question.Why? Why would you want to? I know, right? I was 5, 6 years old, I came home from school, my mom said, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman across the street teaching piano, do you want to take piano lessons?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything else.\u201d So, I started taking piano lessons at 5, stuck with it. Started entering competitions. In high school, I got into theater because that\u2019s where the funny people hung out and that made me laugh. So I was a concert pianist and I thought I was going to do that with my life and be a conductor. And ended up pursuing music, piano, and theater minor. Never really graduated and then got an honorary doctorate. Okay. Okay. I\u2019m still not clear how you got to Hollywood, but go ahead.Oh, oh, sorry. Sorry. So, I ...So, you would do all this in Chicago? You were doing this in Chicago.I was in the middle of a sentence.All right, sorry. Kidding. I was a music director at a dinner theater in St. Charles, Illinois, called Pheasant Run Dinner Theater and we did a lot of great shows. And there, people started getting auditions and stuff as an actor, but I was in the little tiny pit, wishing I was... Because when you\u2019re in the pit of a musical, night after night after night after show after show after show, you\u2019re like ... It\u2019s like watching the same movie over and you can\u2019t really talk to anybody because you have to be quiet. I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is living hell.\u201d Right. But it was a great job. So, it\u2019s a dinner theater. It\u2019s like \u201cOklahoma.\u201d Yeah. We did \u201cOklahoma,\u201d \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d \u201cEvita.\u201dAnd then you had to serve ... Yes, \u201cEvita.\u201d\u201dEvita.\u201d But the actors didn\u2019t do the waiting the tables or anything.Okay, all right. Okay.But it was legit. It was legit theater. The Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune and everybody would come down and review the shows. They said our \u201cEvita\u201d upstaged the original.Oh, okay.It was really great shows. All right.Really amazing shows. Right.Anyway, so I got there ...So, you\u2019re stuck in the theater pit in St. Charles, Illinois.Illinois, yeah.Okay.And then, but I start auditioning ... Sorry, back up to 5 or 6, 7 and 8 years old. My mom and dad, when we were all really little, had us audition for commercials and stuff, which I thought that was odd.Wow.So, like a man came over and interviewed us one by one. One second. You get it? If you\u2019re listening, I posed for a picture. All right. Okay, good.And then the person came over and we talked. And I started going downtown, taking auditions for United Airlines commercials, whatever. Anyway, nothing happened with that. Then I started doing this Pheasant Run, and did some acting in high school and college. And then I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s so much more fun to be up there than in the pit.\u201d So, I started auditioning and just booking commercial, after commercial, after commercial, after commercial.Right. And then, I was like, \u201cWell, this is all we get in Chicago.\u201d Or, like, \u201cWe get commercial work.\u201dRight, commercial.A lot of movies don\u2019t come to town.Not at all.And if one does, you have 10,000 actors auditioning for one line. And you know ...Right, exactly. In a \u201cHome Alone\u201d setting.Yes, exactly.Right, right, \u201cHome Alone.\u201dExactly. What was I auditioning for?\u201cNow, he\u2019s really mad.\u201dI auditioned for \u201cWhile You Were Sleeping\u201d with Sandra Bullock.Oh, yes. Of course.I was like 19, maybe. That\u2019s right.Still waiting to hear. Still waiting to hear. That\u2019s a terrible movie. Yeah, yeah.And so, did that. And then ... The actors and the friends of mine started booking stuff, so it was like ... Anyway, so I started doing that. Did you do Second City or anything else?I did. I did the training program in Second City for a couple years. But I never performed onstage.Right. So, that happened. I\u2019m catching you up and then ...Okay, good. I\u2019m still waiting to get to Los Angeles.What? I know.Okay, so we\u2019re still in Chicago.So then, I decided I\u2019m just going to do it. I\u2019m going to do it while I\u2019m 24 years old. Right. Right.If I don\u2019t look back, I\u2019m young enough. If it doesn\u2019t work out I can come back to this job, right? And so, Anna Chlumsky, who\u2019s on \u201cVeep\u201d ...Right.\u2026 was in \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d at Pheasant Run Dinner Theater at the same ...Okay.She was also in \u201cAnnie\u201d right after \u201cMy Girl.\u201d Remember that movie? \u201cMy Girl\u201d with Anna Chlumsky.Yeah. Yeah.So then she did that and came because she lived in Chicago.Right.And I\u2019ve been friends with her since she was 9 years old. Anyways, so she was in ...A child star who then became a regular, later came back to do \u201cVeep.\u201dYes. Right.Right.And she\u2019s on \u201cVeep\u201d now. And actually, Katrina Lenk who just won the Tony this year, she\u2019s a Pheasant Run ... There\u2019s a lot of people from Pheasant Run who are working.Clearly.Yeah, it was very cool.Wow.And so, anyways ... So, pack my car, I say goodbye to \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d cast and I move to Beverly.\u201cSunrise, Sunset.\u201dYeah. Yeah. Sung it all the way to California.Did you?Yeah. Wasn\u2019t annoying at all.So, you go to Los Angeles and you\u2019re in commercials again, right?Yes. You were in the Doritos commercial. And so I had a little bit of ammo because I had a demo reel with some commercials. Yeah. Right.So, I got a commercial agent right away.Right.Because I was a bigger fish in a smaller pond in Chicago. So, just kind of keep that going.What was your biggest commercial there? I had two spots on the Super Bowl in 1998. Doritos.Doritos and Bud Light.Yeah.And the Bud Light spot, I was shopping with my wife and there was this clothes rounder and you\u2019d hear, \u201cPsst.\u201d And all these guys are inside the clothes rounder, like barbecuing and watching the game. Right. I was like, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d That one. And then the famous Doritos ...Let me hear it in the straight man voice. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201dNo, that was the straight man voice back then because people didn\u2019t know, that was just fun. \u201cHe\u2019s a straight guy who\u2019s fun,\u201d you know? I would say, if I didn\u2019t act ... If you didn\u2019t say Jack was gay in \u201cWill and Grace,\u201d he would just be the kooky nextdoor neighbor.Right, right. Like Jim J. Bullock from \u201cToo Close for Comfort.\u201dYes, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right.But anyway ...So you did Doritos. And the Doritos one was ...Doritos, right? And that same ... I was at Sundance, the Sundance Film Festival with a starring role as Billy in \u201cBilly\u2019s Hollywood Screen Kiss\u201d while those two commercials were airing.So that was it.So there was a lot of what they call \u201cheat\u201d behind me. Yes, okay. All right.You\u2019re probably familiar with that, with all of your ventures.Yes. Yes, I have a lot of ventures. Yeah.Yes, we\u2019re going to talk about those in just a bit.Okay, fine. Okay, let\u2019s move on.And so, because of that, I was sitting at a theater at Sundance Film Festival, starring in this movie, this NBC exec is sitting in the audience. I haven\u2019t even seen the movie yet. He taps me on the shoulder, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re Sean Hayes. You\u2019re in this movie.\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He goes, \u201cWe\u2019re casting this sitcom, \u2018Will and Grace,\u2019 would you come in and read for Will?\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, not right now because I\u2019m about to watch the movie, but maybe when it\u2019s done, blah, blah, blah.\u201dRight. So, I didn\u2019t have the money to change my ticket to fly back early to see it. Because I wanted to experience Sundance because ...Sure. Yes. Fine, yeah, yeah.It was like another week or two left.I\u2019ve been there.But that train has left and they found the brilliant Eric McCormack to play Will. By the time I came back, they said, \u201cWould you read for, \u2018the other guy\u2019?\u201d And I said, \u201cSure.\u201d And that\u2019s how it happened.Wow. That\u2019s like ... And then it just did for a long time.And that was it.How many years? How many years was that on? That was on eight years and now two and then a third next year.Two, third season.Eleven total.That was a very different era of television. You were just the star on the show.Yeah, that was very ... Yeah, yeah, yeah.Right? I\u2019ve never done a TV show, either. I\u2019ve just been in commercials and maybe a guest spot in one of those crime reenactment shows. Where you were like a dead body or what? No. Thanks for the confidence, but no. I was ... I don\u2019t remember. It was like ...Were you a murderer?\u201dI saw the body down by the river.\u201d Oh, right. That kind of thing. Okay.In that same straight guy voice.Okay.Yeah.So, \u201cWill and Grace.\u201d Why do you think it took off back then? I know. Isn\u2019t it bizarre that it ... It still, it blows my mind that Warren Littlefield ... It was a script of three ... Warren Littlefield was a great producer.Amazing.Right. It was a script of three couples. And one of the couples was a gay guy and a straight girl. And Warren said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ... Screw the other couples. This is the most interesting thing.\u201d And \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding\u201d had just come out, with Julia Roberts. Right, and her best friend was gay.Right. Was gay. Right, was ... What\u2019s his name?That guy. That guy.That guy.Yeah, British guy. Rupert ...Rupert Everett.Everett, right. Yeah, yeah.And I never met him, but he seems angry in interviews.Yes, he does. Yeah. Okay.But I hope he\u2019s not. I think he probably is.Okay. Have you seen him much lately?No. That\u2019s a very good point.Thank you. Thank you. I like to cut to the chase.Really? Done.And so \u2014 by the time we\u2019re done, this mic pack will burn a hole through to my intestines because it\u2019s touching my skin. No, so that had come out. So Warren said do that. And that\u2019s kind of why it happened. But it still blows my mind that NBC picked up a show about a gay guy. Right.And even in the pilot, after it tested, stupid people had no idea Will was gay, even though he said many things that would allude to the fact.\u201dI\u2019m gay.\u201d Right, you\u2019re gay. People didn\u2019t know that?People didn\u2019t know because, you know, they\u2019re testing, \u201cThat guy\u2019s funny. Well, that girl\u2019s funny and this is ...\u201d Right.But they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, that dude\u2019s gay?\u201d That was my straight guy voice.How long? How long what? Did it go on that they didn\u2019t know he was gay? Come on. Well, I don\u2019t know, they clearly found out by like the third, fourth, fifth episode.Right. But, that show was highly ... There was actually a series of political shows on the air.Well, Ellen had done the coming out. We always say, \u201cShe opened the door and we kicked it down.\u201d Right, right.So, without that ... And we all, passing the baton.Right.And then you have \u201cModern Family\u201d with an out couple with a kid.Right.Hopefully, I\u2019m not saying \u201cwe did it,\u201d but hopefully we helped ... They\u2019ll help somebody else.But then everybody changed back, it seemed like. Right? Well, there was a joke that the character of Karen, played by Megan Mullally brilliantly on the show, when Bush was in office after Clinton, we were still on and Bush was in office, I go, \u201cKaren, as a gay man ...\u201d She goes, \u201cHoney, didn\u2019t you hear gay isn\u2019t in anymore?\u201dRight. Yeah, yeah.It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s like it\u2019s in and then it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like, \u201cHow is it either?\u201dRight, right.It should just be human.So, what do you think \u201cWill and Grace\u201d did? Did it normalize gays or ... Well, people used that word ...Because you play ... Right. ... and I know why they use that word.Right.But to me, it rubs me the wrong way because ...Well, tell me why?... I\u2019m going to tell you if you just give me a chance.All right then, fine. Normalize ... I know, right? Not even a breath. I like this, you\u2019re always trying to top me here. I like it.Well, I am a top.Do you know what? Straight guys never try to top me. Well ...I\u2019m just saying.Because you\u2019re gay, we\u2019re both gay.I know, yeah. I think she missed the joke, you guys got it. She missed it. Because she\u2019s thinking about the next thing. She doesn\u2019t just be in the moment. So, what now? What was the question? Besides, while you\u2019re trying to top me on figuring out what to do next. Why is \u201cnormalize,\u201d you\u2019re so angry about it.No. Just because the word \u201cnormal.\u201d I\u2019ve always felt normal. Right. Right.But people use the word.Yes, got it.Right. So, that whole thing. But to use your word normalize, do I think \u201cWill & Grace\u201d normalized ... Well, you guys know that I think just like \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d or \u201cGood Times.\u201d By the way, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d present problem excluded, at the time, \u201cThe Bill Cosby Show,\u201d that was like people were floored that a black man could be a doctor.Right.And a black woman could be a lawyer. That was amazing! And to black people that was like, \u201cYeah, that happens.\u201dYeah. Yeah, yeah.And so I think the same thing with \u201cWill and Grace\u201d was, people were just like floored that two gay men could be friends but not have a relationship. And actually be best friends through all of it. And that I think is what people are constantly striving to create in Hollywood, are relationships you\u2019ve never seen before. Because that is a great percolation for a lot of new fodder. For a new fodder. So you do that for eight years and then it ends, right?Yes. And the reason it ended is just things after ...Mutual. It was like, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve exhausted it.\u201d And the network was like, \u201cYeah,\u201d because the ratings weren\u2019t as huge. I mean, they were pretty big still.They were big, yeah.Anybody would kill for those now. Right. But you know, also it\u2019s that syndrome of, in the time of \u201cWill and Grace\u201d ... I think this is most of it. In the time that \u201cWill and Grace\u201d was on the air, NBC had gone through maybe six presidents in eight years.Right. And different owners.And different owners.Right. So, of course, who\u2019s our parent? Like, who\u2019s watching this for us? Who\u2019s watching out for us? So, I think ...Well, at least it wasn\u2019t Les Moonves, but go ahead.Right.Sorry, I had to get that in.No, for sure. Okay.But I figure there\u2019s a little bit of that syndrome going on with the new guy was like, \u201cI want my hands on hit shows.\u201d Maybe?Right. Might not be true. But I think maybe part of it was.Right. And so you all ...So, out with the old because it had been on ...You all went on.Yes, we went on to do things.To do things. One of these you did was produce a lot of things.Yeah.People don\u2019t realize, I think, that you\u2019re sort of Ryan Seacrest-y, so to speak.People say that about Ryan, yeah.Yeah. So, I knew the ... I try as hard as I could to be self-aware, sometimes, I fail miserably on a daily basis. But when I try to be self-aware, I try to see what was in front of me, and knowing history, what happens with sitcom characters that have impact like mine had.Right.And so, you go, \u201cWell, I need a place to go when I get up in the morning, how am I going to fix this? What\u2019s the solution?\u201dBecause you get one hit and then that\u2019s it. And then you don\u2019t see them again.And a lot of the actors are like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine.\u201d And a lot of actors enjoy just acting and that\u2019s great. My brain works a little bit like yours, where it\u2019s just like, \u201cI need ...\u201d The next thing.And I need multiple things going on because it\u2019s ... it fills my soul. That way I don\u2019t have to focus on myself.Okay, good. Right. Interesting.And so ... See the damage? All right. If I just keep busy, then the tears don\u2019t come, but ...It\u2019s true.Boy, is that true, right?Yeah. I once said to someone who asked me, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in therapy?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pretty happy.\u201d And they go, \u201cYou\u2019re blocking.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201dYou\u2019re what? You\u2019re ...I\u2019m blocking.Yeah, you\u2019re blocking. That\u2019s why: We stuff and we block.Yes, it\u2019s working.So you should play football. Yeah. So, then ... See?So you\u2019re doing \u201cWill and Grace\u201d and you decide to produce.Yes. So, then I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to go? What am I going to do?\u201d And then, Tom Hanks is a friend. And I saw what he was doing with Playtone. I thought, well, there\u2019s a perfect example. And I would say I want to embrace that, say WWTHD: What Would Tom Hanks Do? Right, okay.Right?Is he running for president?Wouldn\u2019t we all be better off?Yeah, probably. We\u2019d be better off with a dog, but go ahead.We would be. At least it would listen to us.A cat. Yeah. Some cat.Yeah, a dog would bring us together, at least.Yeah, yeah.Isn\u2019t it interesting. Well, we don\u2019t have to go on with that.Okay, we\u2019ll go on that later. Put a pin in it.Yeah. But, yes. So I decided to do something about that and started producing with my friend that I went to college with, Todd Milner, who was a genius. And we had two shows that we started out with. One was \u201cSituation: Comedy\u201d because that was just the start of people not figuring out multi-cam sitcoms. Why aren\u2019t people watching them anymore? And so, we had a kind of \u201cProject Greenlight\u201d show, do you remember \u201cProject Greenlight?\u201dYeah.But for TV. Right. So, we had submissions of people sending in half-hour multi-cam sitcoms. And we were going to read them all, weed them down. Pick two or three. Shoot them and have America vote on which one they wanted to see go to series, which ended up being way ahead of its time because that\u2019s what Amazon started doing.Yeah, that\u2019s right. Exactly.And then built this gigantic studio.Right. But, we ended up doing it. NBC decided not to. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a cute show, we\u2019re not putting it on the air.\u201d The one that won.Yeah, yeah.So, the other one was called \u201cUnderexposed.\u201d We gave a very vague script to three filmmakers to make ... Go off and you have 24 hours to make a short film based on, \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d \u201cOh my God, what\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s coming this way.\u201d And they had to interpret what that was.Okay.And so, and the judges were Trudie Styler, Jon Favreau and Craig Zadan, who was a good friend of mine, who just passed away. Anyways, those were our first two shows. And then we didn\u2019t work for seven years and then we\u2019ve done tons. We produced \u201cGrimm,\u201d \u201cHot in Cleveland.\u201d \u201cGrimm\u201d was a huge hit.Yeah, \u201cGrimm\u201d was. And then \u201cHot in Cleveland\u201d with Betty White and all those great girls. And then ...\u201dHollywood Game Night.\u201d\u201dHollywood Game Night,\u201d which is still on, we\u2019re shooting right now. \u201cHistory of Comedy,\u201d on CNN right now, and a bunch of stuff.Right.And we just shot our first movie called \u201cLazy Susan\u201d starring me, where I play a woman.Okay.I play Susan.\u201cLazy Susan.\u201dI play Lazy Susan. The whole time you\u2019re a woman, or you\u2019re man being a woman?The whole time I\u2019m a woman. A hot woman, the entire time.Yep. How do you look?I look not attractive. You would not be into me.Okay. Okay, all right.Yeah.Yeah. Well, I like now, the whole ... Yeah, well ...You\u2019ve got the lesbian thing going on right now.Let\u2019s talk after this.Okay, all right.I do, I told you that last time, I dress like a lesbian.You do, I was going to say that. And you do, too. Yes, I do, indeed.Yeah. I was just recent ... I was telling people I was ... I\u2019ve been doing some research on some of the e-commerce companies. Stitch Fix is one of them, so I was trying ... Stitch Fix is where they send you stuff and you send it back. Do you know about these things? No, tell me, what? The company went public, I think. It went public. And they send you five things and then you ...What do you mean?Five pieces of clothing.Well, you have to say clothing.Clothing, I\u2019m sorry.They send you five things. Like a watch, my niece. They send you a box of Coco Puffs.Yeah. They send you five pieces of clothing. And they kept sending me clothing. It was all wrong for me. There was frills going on, there was all kind of ...Yeah. There\u2019s many of those.I send it back. I keep sending it back. And then one day stuff started coming that I liked. Yeah.And all of a sudden all five things were things I liked. Like five things. And so I kept them.This is a great story.I\u2019m getting there.\u201dAnd they send me five things I love. Anyway, Sean, so back to producing...\u201dOkay, I\u2019m going to get back to producing. So, the stylist \u2014 and I\u2019m going to finish this story because you\u2019re such an asshole. All right?Okay.And the stylist said, \u201cI finally figured you out, you\u2019re simple and androgynous.\u201d Oh.Which I don\u2019t think was a compliment, but was exactly right.I like \u201csimple.\u201dSimple and androgynous. So, this is my look. Anyway, back to you.Yeah, but it\u2019s comfy. It\u2019s comfy, thanks.I don\u2019t like ...That\u2019s a real hot look. I don\u2019t love wearing this stuff ...Yeah, yeah.... because the second I walk in that door of my house, pajamas, sweats, I mean, like ...All right. Okay. Now, back to producing. So, tell me how things have changed with producing. Seriously, because in Hollywood you have to think of digital.Yeah.We were over there talking about podcasts. Yeah.But how do you look at yourself as a producer? Has Hollywood changed a lot? Yeah, well ... There\u2019s a million things we can talk about that. But you have to ... I\u2019m going to say something that sounds like a joke, but it\u2019s not. You have to find a hole and fill it, right?Yes.So you have to find out, you have to figure out what\u2019s not out there and provide that entertainment. But you know, now producing ... There\u2019s different kinds of producers, right? We\u2019re both creative and packaging so we act like our own little mini-studio. So we will find a writer and a director and an actor and the idea and the IP and try to patch it and put it together. Which is a lot of work, but we run in overdrive. So we do that with many, like with 20 things at one time. And so I think now ... The good news for us is people need content more than ever.Right, there\u2019s so many outlets.And there\u2019s so many outlets which is also bad for viewerships and making money because you have split now this pie of viewership in a billion ways, which is good and bad. There\u2019s good and bad to that. If you find your niche like you have, you can make a living, a pretty good living. So we have a deal at Universal Studios. So now we have our ...Just NBC.\u2026 are able to provide content mainly for them, for the studio, not necessarily that, but for the studio and what they\u2019re looking for. And so ... But ... I don\u2019t know. So day to day we tried ...So why do you have a deal Universal, not NBC, versus doing things for all ... Because you have more choice there. You go to Amazon. Like look, \u201cMarvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d the hottest show, I think right now is on Amazon.Amazon, right? And then you have now ...And Jennifer Sulky, who used to be vice president at NBC is now president at Amazon.President. Yes. Took over from the guy who had some issues. Yeah. Roy Price.Get in line.Yeah. I am, get in line. You\u2019re right. We\u2019ll talk about that in a second.  Why don\u2019t you as a producer ... Do you think about Amazon and Google or Apple is now moving in. Apple did a deal with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think Apple is doing it right though, because Apple had two shows a year or two ago.They were terrible.And they asked me to host \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d and I was like, why? Why would I host that? Because James Corden does it brilliantly.That\u2019s right.And now you\u2019re breaking that off making it. And I started telling them everything, that why that wouldn\u2019t work and like, \u201cUh huh, got it, thanks Sean.\u201d And then ... But now they\u2019re doing it right. They\u2019re stockpiling and they\u2019re going to launch huge. That\u2019s exactly how ... But they have billions of dollars to do that. Right. That\u2019s what I mean. How do you look at that when you have that and then you also ... Google is obviously going to get into it somewhere, they\u2019ve been trying to do YouTube originals.I always ask people like, where is this going? Because nobody knows, right?Right.So where is this going with 500,000 new shows every year? Right. So tell me. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I want to know.I don\u2019t know.Nobody knows, but that\u2019s why I\u2019ll always be employed. Because ...That\u2019s what I mean.Yeah. There will be ... But the problem is ownership. So the networks now have ... It\u2019s becoming a dinosaur business.Right.But I think the streaming companies that figured it out, but everybody wants to ... We\u2019re all held hostage now because unless you\u2019re not a writer/producer who\u2019s created the show as in non-writing producers like myself and there\u2019s many of us, there\u2019s no ownership. So you have to make better deals if you can with the success that you\u2019ve built.Right. Better deals with who? ... Have you thought about going ... Like look, Shonda Rhimes has gone to Netflix.She\u2019s a writer/showrunner.Right. Ryan Murphy, same thing.Writer/showrunner.So that they will be going to them from now on because the money is better and the freedom is better. Yes. Right?Right. Exactly.So, they can do whatever they want.So it\u2019s almost like ... By the way ...What does that do when Shonda Rhimes and a Ryan Murphy leave?But that, leave what? Right?Right.So, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s like these guys are just ... These are the new networks. That\u2019s all. Everything is exactly the same. Everything is ... They make deals with people. People are going to these streaming companies because they can do with their creative freedom, the deals are better, there\u2019s more ownership, you can swear, you can tell real stories. A network is a dinosaur business because they have to rely on the affiliate still and advertising and that they are limiting because you have to watch what you say and do.Right. So what would you prefer to do as a producer ...Well anybody creative would like to be out of the chains of ...To do different things. Right. Have you talked to some of these companies? Have you gone to meet with them? Yes, of course. And?Yeah. We have relationships everywhere. Right. So what is your digital? Who do you do that with now? Because you have at NBC, at Universal.So my company, Hazy Mills Productions, we have employees ...Why is it called Hazy Mills?Because I\u2019m Hayes and Todd Milner.Oh, I see now. It\u2019s okay.And we went to college at Illinois State University in the middle of the cornfield and all you would see is these mills.Okay. Got it.So it\u2019s Hazy Mills.Okay. I Like it.You\u2019re welcome.Okay. Thank you. So in our company, we have employees that are heads of reality, digital, film, TV, comedy TV, drama. So everybody has different ...And different things.Right. So we are working on all of those things every day. And so now podcasts, we want to get into podcasts, which we spoke about before this thing.Right. Right. And why do you feel like you have to do that? Because WWTHD. What Would Tom Hanks Do?Right.Did he do a podcast?No, but I\u2019m just saying, you constantly have to think forward and think about ... Tom started a production company so long ago before other actors started them. And so I just thought that was so cool. And so in keeping with trying to stay on top of that and where this is going, you know, Jeffrey Katzenberg is launching NewTV. So we had a conversation with him about that.With Meg Whitman.What\u2019s that?With Meg Whitman.Yeah. Meg Whitman.Who I know very well. From eBay.Oh, you do?Yes, very well.I don\u2019t know her.Well, she\u2019s from eBay and so I wonder how she can produce television, but okay. Right?Okay. Well, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see, right.Yeah.Yeah.Well, it\u2019s 10 minutes ... What I\u2019m to understand is it\u2019s 10-minute increments. Do you guys know about this? Yeah. This is a new ...So it\u2019s a new thing where they\u2019re producing 10-minute shows.That are very expensive.That are very expensive. But it\u2019s for the on-the-go person on the phone. And then, right, whatever, I\u2019d be on the subway, you can watch 10 minutes or wherever.I have a problem with that, I have to say.Tell me what is ...Because I think it\u2019s a mistake to think young people want to watch edible food, \u201cedible\u201d TV. Snacky.I kind of agree, and I don\u2019t know the full plan so I can\u2019t comment on it fully, but I ultimately ... people who would want to sit down and watch an hour program or half-hour program.But some watch all of \u201cMrs. Maisel.\u201dIn one sitting.Yeah. One sitting. But you know, well no, not one sitting. Well, but yeah.Yeah, you know what I mean. He binged it.But I\u2019m saying, they\u2019re able to watch a thing over a period of time.Yeah. But I mean this is a ... It\u2019s a new way to produce content and distribute it. So who knows? It might work. So getting back to as a producer you\u2019re always looking for different angles. You would do a deal with anybody, like that kind of thing. Well, yeah. What\u2019s that?Would you do a web deal in contrast ...?As long as it makes sense for us, yeah. And it was people who understood our brand and yeah. I mean, we\u2019ve been so happy and very well taken care of with NBC Universal Television.Do you think people will ultimately watch everything on these small devices? Is that how you think as a producer? I think yes, I think forever, they will. You\u2019ve heard this a million times, your TV is actually going to be a monitor. It is a monitor.It\u2019s not a TV anymore. Yeah, it is now.It is now, essentially.So it\u2019s just a bigger monitor, it\u2019s a small ...I don\u2019t think I watch \u201cWill & Grace\u201d at the time that it\u2019s on ever, ever. Oh, really? I don\u2019t. No. No. I don\u2019t watch it on the night unless ...Yeah, nobody really does anymore, anything.And why would I?Yeah. Exactly. Right.Why would I?So talk about the return to \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d So here you are doing this production stuff, very successful shows. You\u2019re a producer, you\u2019ve had quite a few hits. Why did you decide to do this? To come back? Yeah.We did an election video in 2016 to lend our voices in the best way we knew how, which was through this show, instead of tweeting or standing on a soapbox or whatever. So Max Mutchnick, one of the creators of \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d came up with this idea. We haven\u2019t seen each other in 11 years or whatever, 10 years. Let\u2019s ... Because everybody wanted to do this election video, because if we write it and we\u2019re like, yeah, of course that\u2019d be great. So the crew, us writers, everybody got together for free. Nobody got paid. We did it in secret, NBC didn\u2019t even know. We went to this stage that was below another stage, and we called it \u201cHot Food\u201d as the code name.Right. That\u2019s a long, long story why that happened. So we shot Hot Food, released it, and millions and millions and millions of people watched it and we\u2019re like, \u201cWait, what?\u201d And so, that\u2019s how it happened. And then the network called us like, \u201cWould you guys want to do this?\u201d And we actually had a dinner at my house, just the four of us. And we talked about it and we were like, \u201cYeah, it seems like now is the time.\u201d And by then we\u2019d had that conversation after our current president got \u201celected.\u201dOkay. All right. We will get to that in a second.And so, yeah. And so we thought we had something to say about that and we have something to say about these people, these characters living in a time that everybody else is living in. That\u2019s what\u2019s cool about the show. These characters \u2026[cheers next door]Woo, it\u2019s like something is over there. Yeah.Yeah. We should probably be over there. Yeah. Exactly.These characters experience things the same way America does.America does.So at the same time.Did you worry about that sort of return to like ... there\u2019s several of them now, after ... \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d just came back. Yours is very sharp.Thanks. The writing is amazing.It\u2019s superb. I worry about when things come back, whether they\u2019re going to be as good as ...Yeah. I do too.Was that a worry for you?No. Because we had long, long conversations about what this would look like. And before, we were like, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Because now, we have proof of concept. Now we knew people wanted it to come back. So before we decide to, let\u2019s really sit down and talk about what this looks like, what these characters would be, and so, great. And they\u2019re very self-aware enough to write the character, self-aware. So ageism, all of those things were written because we have to write what the audience thinks.Right. Right. And what do you ... Some of these things which shows are not good, they\u2019re not ... They shouldn\u2019t come back. They are not ... Right. They were quick fixes for ratings for a network in this kind of climate.Exactly. Right. In this kind of climate, meaning?Meaning the downtrodden...That the ratings are so much lower.Yeah. That they get lower and lower every year for every single show in television. Right.Except for events like the Super Bowl and all those things.Right. And so how do you deal with that? And live musicals, those as well.Right. How do you conceive of a show if that\u2019s the case, if there\u2019s going to be lower ratings.Well they have to figure out, and I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t, already have ... And this is the part that I\u2019m not in behind closed doors of is they have to figure out how to make deals with the advertisers about same-day plus-three plus-seven in DVR numbers. I don\u2019t know how that works, but you can\u2019t just say, well, you got a point five and your show is canceled. Now there are other factors that culminate in the decision of making a show a hit. So you have to take that into consideration.So what if it is?Yeah. What if it is? Right.Right.Because our numbers got a huge and three .... plus three like last year, in plus three or plus seven. We were like the No. 3 show on television. There was like \u201cBig Bang\u201d and football...And \u201cWill & Grace.\u201dYeah.Why do you think it\u2019s been successful now? Is it just the writing or is it the timing? I think so. I think to find ... From an actor\u2019s perspective, I think we\u2019re so in the skin of the characters that people pick up on that and see that we try to play it as real as possible. Because the problem with the format now, it is so old, it is aging, that a lot of people act ...The format. The comedy. Yeah, the sitcom.The format is ... A lot of actors act presentationally. Because it is very theater. Yeah. So it feels unreal. And yes, there\u2019s nothing real about our show, either. It\u2019s fake, but I guess people react to ... And yes the writing and it\u2019s just ... If you cut all the bullshit out about what we\u2019re talking about right now, it\u2019s just funny.Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.That\u2019s all people give a shit about.Yeah. Yeah. And do you ... You\u2019re going now for three seasons and how long do you expect this to go on? I would like it to ...Were you surprised how will it did? Yeah.Because the first show is what? In the Trump White House? Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.You were having sex with the Secret Service agent.Yeah. Right out with a bang. Right.Right.Right. Right.I remember that, years ago.Ridiculous. Yeah, that first season was back with 16 episodes. We\u2019re doing 18 now and 18 next year. So, that will bring us to around 240ish episodes. \u201cCheers\u201d was on 275, \u201cBig Bang\u201d is going to be on 279. I would like to do 280.280. All right. So because ...Yeah. Because \u201cBig Bang\u201d will be the longest-running one in history.Right. And you\u2019d like to just ...Why not? It will be fun, right?Yeah, absolutely. So what do you imagine is going to happen? Are you still getting married? My character?I saw you in the show the other day recently.My character?Yeah. Your character.Yeah. He\u2019s getting married to Estefan Gloria, who is a flight attendant played by Brian Jordan Alvarez. And yeah, so the season will end with a wedding and we\u2019ll see how that goes. Yeah. Do you like that Jack is getting married?Yeah, I think it\u2019s hilarious. There\u2019s so many areas we still haven\u2019t touched on with the characters and that\u2019s one of them, Jack being married. Like, what\u2019s that like? Right, exactly. And one thing that you do a lot of is ...Talk too much.No, I think it\u2019s great. You talk plenty, but it\u2019s funny enough. Is really take aim at the Trump administration. You really do. All your Sessions ... Or your Pence jokes.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.There were several Pence jokes.Yeah. Yeah.But I was like, I could not believe they said it on network television.Yeah. Well, he\u2019s a bad man. I understand that. I get that sense. Yeah. So somebody ... I think more can be done through the power of comedy than just yelling and screaming. Yeah. Yeah. What was the Pence joke? It was so good. There were so many. There were several. You did several of them.Yeah. We did ... I was talking to Karen about getting plastic surgery done. She\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019ll take that Mitch McConnell neck right out of there.\u201d So that was great. He\u2019s a bad man, too.Oh, my God. The turtle. Yeah.The turtle, yeah.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He\u2019s, they\u2019re all bad men right now.\u201cFour turtle doves, four turtle necks.\u201d That\u2019s the invention of, that\u2019s why they invented the turtleneck. Because Mitch McConnell.Right. Exactly. Because of Mitch. So you could cover up...Yeah. He\u2019s a turtle neck. Yeah. You know he\u2019s married to Elaine Chao. Yes. I do know that. Which is so ironic. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be in their home, to watch that ... I want to have dinner with Michele Bachmann. Do you? Why?And Mitch McConnell, all those people. Because I don\u2019t think they know gay people. Yes, they do. They can\u2019t possibly. I think they do.Really?Yes. And?I don\u2019t know. And they don\u2019t like them or they like them?I think ... I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think they think about people in those terms. So I want to finish up talking about politics. So here you are. This is a highly ... I\u2019m shocked by some of the things that are on \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d And I love it. I like that they\u2019re doing it.Yeah. Yeah. I do, too.They go very far for a network show, even more so than the ones on Netflix or anywhere else, which is really fascinating to me.Yeah. Yeah.How do you guys feel about that? How do you feel ... Do you feel at risk doing that? Or is it just ...No. I think again because of the more niche-y audiences now. We have our loyal audience and we\u2019re there for people to enjoy it if you want to come along. But it has a point of view and I think that\u2019s why it does well. That\u2019s another reason why it does well.Because some things change, I agree.Yeah. And that\u2019s a strong point of view.I think it has to be genuine. I think a lot about companies.And I think that\u2019s why people responded to \u201cRoseanne\u201d or whatever show that\u2019s a hit. They\u2019ve a very strong point of view. There\u2019s something to say about that.What did you think of that of what happened there with Roseanne?What happened with Roseanne?Yeah.What do you say?I don\u2019t know. What do you say?I don\u2019t know. I asked you first.I think she is appalling.You do.Yes.I think she\u2019s ill. Yes. That\u2019s what I mean.And that makes me sad for her. Yes it does, but I thought it was really interesting how they ... The reaction was really interesting to me. Yes. And I found it surprising that she was unaware that the president of NBC [ABC] is an African-American. Yeah, that\u2019s true. Yeah, that\u2019s true. That would be an issue. But the thing is ...When you kind of have met her ...What was interesting is the quickness of social media and stuff like that. Now you, do you participate on all that or not at all? I do, yeah. Twitter and Instagram.Yeah. You have an account. And what do you think about that? How do you do that? Because she just started typing, probably ...People who know me in that world, I don\u2019t ... I\u2019m not a politics person. I just ... It\u2019s not who I am. It\u2019s not in my DNA. For some reason you\u2019re making me talk about it, I feel uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t ... I\u2019m not one of those people. Right. But what do you use it for then? What do you use social for?To spread joy. Have you ever heard of that, Kara Swisher? No. Not at all. I don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not my job. Pain and suffering. No. Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s kind of like my brand, I guess.But where I want to get at with Roseanne is, are celebrities aware of the impact that they have using social media or do you think they have ...Absolutely. What do you mean that they are aware of? Of course they are aware of.I mean I know, but not everybody uses it. I can tell you a lot of celebrities don\u2019t use it. I had to bother a billion of them for them to use.Want them to use it for politics or use it in general?No. Use it for their work, to get their work done, and get the ...Yeah. I mean, I guess you kind of have to, right? It\u2019s part of the gig now.Right, so you use Twitter, what else do you use? Twitter, Instagram and that\u2019s pretty much it. Yeah.Yeah. You don\u2019t use Facebook.And I text a lot. You text a lot. OK, I don\u2019t get...Oh, Facebook, sorry. Facebook.And Facebook yeah. Facebook a lot. We ... Some people at Facebook said ... Me and my husband Scotty were \u2014 their quote, not mine \u2014 \u201cthe pioneers of video on Facebook.\u201d Right. Explain what you do?Because we did lip sync videos and we were the first ... Some of the, if not the, first people to actually post content for enjoyment on Facebook. So we lip sync to famous songs and we ... And that, by the way, that\u2019s the end of the sentence. Yeah. And then what do you ... Why did you do that? And not on YouTube? Why not on YouTube?Why\u2019d we do that? Because if a day goes by that I\u2019m not feeling creative in my brain is the day like we spoke where I have to look at myself and be sad so I don\u2019t want to do that. So we create stuff and he is a music producer, composer. He does the music for \u201cWill & Grace\u201d and \u201cThe History of Comedy\u201d along with his music producer Leo Rosner and they\u2019re great together. And so we were like ... We were literally sitting there and he goes, \u201cHey, come listen to this Jennifer Hudson and Iggy Azalea song.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s really cool.\u201d \u201cHey, we should lip sync to it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWe should make a video.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cFor what?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cJust because.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going back inside unless.\u201d Because his office is in the back, \u201cI\u2019m going back inside and I\u2019m sitting on the couch, watch TV.\u201d Right. So he\u2019s like, \u201cJust listen to it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI listen to, oh, it\u2019s cool.\u201d He goes, \u201cJust memorize the rap part.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cUgh, it\u2019s too much work.\u201d Okay. So I took the dog for a walk around the block and put my airpods, earbuds, whatever.AirPods.And listened to it over and over again. It was kind of fun to do it. And then I was like, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it,\u201d one or two takes. We put it on the web. And I was like, that\u2019s kind of funny. I literally thought my friends were going to see it and that\u2019s it. 40 million people and we\u2019re like, what? And then that just started it. So then we started doing that over and over again. So why didn\u2019t you make a business out of that? We tried so hard.Yeah. But you were on Facebook. That\u2019s why.Exactly. Nobody was interested. No. Nobody on Facebook. Right. And then we didn\u2019t know how YouTube worked and I don\u2019t know.What do you mean you didn\u2019t know how YouTube works?No. I mean like, so you put it up. Okay, great. So then what? But there are a lot of YouTube stars. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of that.I know, but I\u2019m busy doing 10,000 other things.I get that.To go and have a meeting at YouTube. But like how do we monetize that? All right. Well, you need a producer, but you know what? I\u2019m just going to make the videos, put them up and go back to my work.That\u2019s how most of the YouTube stars work. You know that?What\u2019s that? They all like live in one area of Los Angeles.Oh, of course. But I\u2019m like, that\u2019s for them. I\u2019m an actor, producer. So you don\u2019t have time for that, even though you have 40 million downloads. Don\u2019t you look at that number and say maybe there\u2019s something going on here?If somebody wants to take that on and show me where to stand and what to say, I will do it.Right. But you\u2019re not. I don\u2019t want to ... I\u2019m not ...You don\u2019t want to be a YouTube star?To build that business is exhausting. Right.It\u2019s exhausting. You have to put out content constantly.You do.While I\u2019m doing all those ...I was with a YouTube star on the weekend and that\u2019s what she was saying.Yeah.She was saying that it\u2019s exhausting.And they have a window, just like an actor has a window. Just like anybody else would. Yeah.  They absolutely do. She\u2019s exhausted by it, I think. But still, it\u2019s quite huge. Yeah. It is.It\u2019s a constant ...So I have to go to bed, Kara, every night knowing I made people happy without making money. I see. Okay. Do you feel good about that? What\u2019s that? Do you feel good about that?I feel really good about that.Good. That\u2019s nice. So did you stop doing them? Or do you keep doing them?We just did one in Spanish about a month ago and then we might do a Halloween one. Like what? What\u2019s the Halloween one? Yeah.Do you know \u201cKooky\u201d? The song?No.[hums song] Who sings that? Dusty Springfield maybe?Okay. Maybe.Maybe. I don\u2019t know. \u201cSpooky!\u201d Not Kooky. \u201cSpooky.\u201d \u201cSpooky.\u201dOkay. \u201cSpooky.\u201dI sound like a dad. I\u2019m just like, \u201cNot Kooky, \u2018Spooky.\u2019\u201dSo last bit. You\u2019ve been married eight years?I\u2019ve been married I think four but together 12.But 12. So you met on the set of \u201cWill & Grace\u201d?He was the DJ on the Ellen DeGeneres talk show.Wow.When it first started.Right.And so you could say, I kind of met him that way. And you had a marriage-marriage? A gay marriage.A gay marriage. It is legal now. Yeah, I know, I heard. Right now. Just when I got divorced, but go ahead.Timing is everything. So in our backyard, with like eight people, it was great. And he\u2019s a music producer. Yeah, he makes music, he does music for \u201cThe History of Comedy\u201d and I said that already and he actually composed the theme for \u201cHistory of Comedy\u201d and I played it. I want to finish up. No reaction, by the way.I heard you. The reaction was inside my brain. Sure. I wonder how it\u2019s like just to spend a couple of hours there.It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really hard.It\u2019s really like a haunted house, like getting people scared on your left and right. Right? Around this corner it\u2019s like \u2014 whoa! \u2014 Michael Myers.It just came back. I know, I can\u2019t wait, I love it. Are you excited? Are you going to see it?Yes, of course. I cannot see it.Why you so scared? Because it\u2019s ... you already have it in your brain.Because I went to ... I am Michael Myers. I went to see it when I was a teenager. Right?Yes, of course.I guess we were around the same age, right? And my boyfriend at the time had seen it before me and he got up to get popcorn during part of it and ...And the scariest part was that you were with a guy.Yeah. That\u2019s scary ... He was a very nice ... I was a great girlfriend. Let me just tell you.Okay.To straight men. You know why? Because I slept with him, I wasn\u2019t clingy, and I wanted him to leave me alone. Men like that. Men ... honestly, we\u2019re the perfect girlfriends. Think about it.That\u2019s hilarious!Lesbians make the perfect girlfriend to straight guys. Think about it.By the way, really quick sidebar, about \u201cHalloween.\u201dYes.But sidebar. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s fascinating when gay marriage wasn\u2019t legal and people were fighting against it, that me and you could have legally gotten married?I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t ask me. John Lovett asked me.But, isn\u2019t that kind of creepy?Yes. Okay, glad we\u2019re the same ...It\u2019s weird.Like my ...We can still get legally married, but you\u2019re already married.Scary.The scary moment in the movie, he grabbed my ankles under the ... under this chair ...Yeah.And I\u2019ve never gotten over that.Wow!I know. It was really cruel. So, do you not like scary movies at all?I hate scary movies. I won\u2019t see \u201cThe Purge,\u201d those aren\u2019t really scary, they\u2019re just gross.Wow, yeah. Or like, \u201cSaw,\u201d or anything.But what about ...I don\u2019t like ...... what about, \u201cGet Out,\u201d which is like a thriller? I barely made it through that one.Oh that\u2019s a great movie.I know this. I did go to that cause I heard it was good. So I did go see it. But, I don\u2019t like ...\u201cFatal Attraction\u201d?No. But it\u2019s not a horror film.I didn\u2019t like it.Oh, all right.I don\u2019t like it. Like, I go to \u201cman movies,\u201d I go to like ...\u201cThe Lion King\u201d?That\u2019s fine. Okay. It\u2019s okay?Yes.Scar dies.I went to see the Michael Moore movie this weekend, with my children. My sons. My teenage sons.Oh! Fahrenheit-Fahrenheit-... Fahrenheit-\u201cFahrenheit 11/9 ...\u201d... nine. And?I loved it. Oh, I can\u2019t wait to see it.I love a Michael Moore movie.Let\u2019s talk about documentaries for a second. We gotta go, or no?All right, yeah no, go ahead. Keep going.Okay, so wait, \u201cWhitney.\u201dThen we\u2019ll get some questions.That was a great one.Yes.Lesbian.Whitney as in who?Whitney Houston.Everyone knows that, yes, go ahead.I know, but like, that\u2019s it.Okay, thank you. The lesbians knew that a long time ago.I know.Yeah. Kelly McGillis, we know. We know the whole story.Kelly McGillis. Fight with Jodie Foster. Go ahead, move along.I didn\u2019t know that.Yeah, I\u2019ll tell you later.Okay, so wait. Whitney ... I saw the Mr. Rogers one, which was great.Great, it was amazing.Not a lot happens.No, no.He was just great to kids.Well, it\u2019s Mr. Rogers. Yeah, but great. You\u2019re not gonna get suddenly ...Right, there\u2019s no drama.Right. But, great documentary. Jane Fonda: great documentary.I had not seen that one, but I\u2019m going to.Very good.Warren Buffett?I didn\u2019t ... Oh, I saw that one, yeah. Yeah.How about the McDonald\u2019s every day? I know, you know what, I\u2019m going somewhere to Omaha next week, to go meet someone.That\u2019s very specific.Very specific. But, what? Who? Warren Buffett.You\u2019re going to meet him, for what?He\u2019s a fan of the podcast. He wanted to meet me.Just you two?Yeah.Oh my God, I would love to meet him.Dinner. He\u2019s ...I met his daughter, she was very nice.He wants to have a steak dinner. I\u2019m a vegetarian, I\u2019m gonna eat a steak. I\u2019m really gonna get a ...No.Yes, I am. Well, you don\u2019t have to.But I\u2019m going to.Why?\u2018Cause it\u2019s Warren Buffett, and he offered me a steak and so I\u2019m gonna have it.Oh, right. Isn\u2019t he a brilliant ...Yeah.That man\u2019s brilliannt.Yeah, he is, so ... yeah, stuff like that. Anyway, yes. Documentaries ...So anyway, I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s a couple of other ones. \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d you know, there\u2019s a second season.Yeah.So what did I do? Googled it, \u2018cause I wanted to know the outcome.What?\u2019Cause if it\u2019s a happy ending, I would watch it. If it\u2019s not, why waste my time?I don\u2019t understand that. I don\u2019t even ... what do you mean?\u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d did you see the first one?Yes, I did, but it\u2019s not happy at all!Okay, so the second one, shh, listen to me, stop talking. The second one, is about a prosecutor from Chicago trying to overturn the verdict. I see, right.Right, so I was rooting for those guys. Cause I don\u2019t think ... I think they\u2019re innocent. Right.So, I was like, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d because I saw the trailer for it, I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a minute, if she doesn\u2019t win and overturn the verdict, I\u2019m gonna feel really bad about it.\u201dBut then you found out anyway, by Googling.But if she does, how thrilling is that gonna be?Right.And so I won\u2019t tell you how it ends.Okay, fine, so I\u2019m not gonna watch it anyway. So it\u2019s fine.Okay, cause it\u2019s got murder in it?Right, so I\u2019m gonna take some questions from the audience in a second. But the last questions that I wanted: When you look at this environment, or the midterm elections ...Oh, we gotta talk about SonicCloud, too.Oh, SonicCloud, yes, investments ... What invest ... You do investments, also? Yeah, I have several, but one that\u2019s really on fire.Because that\u2019s a thing, Hollywood people doing tech investments.Well, it\u2019s not a thing that\u2019s only in Hollywood. There\u2019s other human beings that invest.Yes, that\u2019s true, but every now and then Matt Damon pops up in the investment ...Because he\u2019s famous. But ... so you hear about that investment.Yeah. And then they fail.Most human beings invest.That\u2019s right, okay, so ...So, \u201cyou Hollywood folks invest\u201d is a nice little Kara Swisher dig to the Hollywood community.It\u2019s true though, I really have to come troop down here to meet Ashton Kutcher every three years about whatever he\u2019s investing in. But, go ahead.Oh, really? Does he ...He actually is a very successful investor.I know, I need to invest what he\u2019s in.He was in Uber, he was in ...I know, amazing.Yeah.So anyway, I invested in this thing that\u2019s very ... getting very large right now, which is called SonicCloud. SonicCloud is an app on your phone that makes hearing more clear for people with moderate to profound hearing loss. Okay.Wow, how\u2019d you get into that?My friend ... one of my very close friends, Larry Guterman, who directed a movie called \u201cCats and Dogs.\u201dYeah.Hilarious movie. Back in 2000, I think. He has hearing loss, so he invented this, with many other people. And so it also allows you to stream media \u2014 music, TV and movies \u2014 without the use of captions or hearing aids.Oh, wow.So, it\u2019s revolutionary. And, right now it\u2019s doing really well, and there\u2019s other things happening that I probably can\u2019t talk about. Among people who have hearing loss.Right, which is hundreds of millions of people.Right.It\u2019s not just hearing loss, it\u2019s anybody ...He filled a hole, in a niche.That\u2019s right.That\u2019s right.But, it\u2019s people who have even mild ... who would like to hear more clearly.Right.Right.Did you invest in any other internet companies? Or things?Yes, something called KnowMe.KnowMe, what do they do?It was what somebody, I think the iPhone now adapted it, but storytelling through ... You used to hold the phone and just record and as soon as you let go, it stops recording. And it would piece together those videos. You could tell a story. Right, and what happened?Didn\u2019t do well.Didn\u2019t do well?No. Do you like investing in internet companies?I do if I know it\u2019s Google.Right. Yeah, there\u2019s only one Google. I know.It\u2019s done. I know.It\u2019s actually in a bit of a trouble. Do you think about the damage the internet companies are doing to our society, ever? I think about it all the time. Oh God, that\u2019s so heavy.I know.What the internet companies are doing to our society, in what way?I don\u2019t know, the election?Well, yes, of course. Yeah. Yeah.I mean, but it also does good things. But, yes. It does a lot of bad things.I think it does. Anyway, let\u2019s ask questions from the audience. Sorry to end on a bummer question.Questions, questions? Right here.Audience member: Do you, in your business dealings as a producer, or even as an investor, do you find that being a gay man in this continent still has its barriers in that world?Sean Hayes: So he asked if I was, as an out gay man, if I came into problems in investments or producing or other ventures, if that ever comes into play. I\u2019m sure it does, it\u2019s never ... I never feel it or hear it, because I don\u2019t, I stopped taking care of people\u2019s feelings in that area a long time ago and their uncomfortableness. So now I just kind of own who I am. So if they have a problem, I don\u2019t know about it.I don\u2019t think so, as much in Hollywood ...I don\u2019t think, not in Hollywood really, yeah.Yeah. I don\u2019t think so. Hasn\u2019t stopped me.But boy, the second you take a step out.What do you mean? Oh, anywhere else?Just like, yeah.You think?I\u2019m not a big star in, you know, parts of Texas.How is it in Illinois? That\u2019s, you know, really ... it\u2019s an unusual ... you\u2019re right, they like the lesbians more.I went to a high school reunion, my high school reunion three weeks ago.But you would be the most famous person from your high school, presumably, right?I don\u2019t know about that. But, yes.Imagine, yes. Who else?But... So, and everybody was so lovely. I actually am one of the few who loved high school. And there was one guy who didn\u2019t look at me and I was like, \u201cHey!\u201d, and my hand was outstretched to shake his hand and he just didn\u2019t look at me and put his fist up for a fist-bump. I was like, oh, so gross. Really? You thought that was ...Where\u2019s the evolution?Really, he thought it was just anti-gay. Or maybe you did something?I got that vibe that I\u2019m familiar with.Yes, I\u2019m familiar with it too. Yeah. I\u2019ve had it happen to me. And, did you not do anything? You didn\u2019t want to say anything?But, what\u2019s the point?Yeah, what did he do?That\u2019s like trying to change a Trumpster.Right, well you can. Don\u2019t you think?I can ... I think, the news today reports ... and the extreme left and the extreme right, because there\u2019s a lot of drama there, and that\u2019s what people are into. And nobody reports on the independents or the undecided. Right, why do you think that is? Cause it\u2019s ratings?There\u2019s no story.There\u2019s no story, what is these ...I mean there is a story, I think it\u2019s interesting, but there\u2019s not the flaming drama.Right, is that where we\u2019re headed, do you think?Where, to...?In that thing, where we\u2019re, the part ... the bipart ... there\u2019s no such thing as bipartisanship.But then, they always say we need to campaign to the undecided and the independents.Right, exactly. But what do you imagine is going to happen in the midterms? I don\u2019t know. I think that both sides are fired up. I\u2019d like to believe that the left is more fired up now. But, we shall see.Do you wanna have a left and a right? Do you really wanna have that?No, I think we should have, I think we should have an independent.Right, in the middle between everybody. Yeah.Yeah.It really is ...Don\u2019t you think, maybe, it\u2019s heading that way?I don\u2019t know, I think people every day ... Trump does something like the Saudi thing that I was telling you about, that they\u2019re \u201crogue killers\u201d now, he just repeats what this obviously fascist dictator in Saudi Arabia is saying.I think, I don\u2019t have ... I\u2019m not as well-versed in politics as you are, I don\u2019t have like statistics and history to call up in my brain in an instant. So I react emotionally, like most of the country does. And just from an emotional standpoint, it\u2019s embarrassing. He\u2019s embarrassing.Yes, of course. But I think people ... It never ends, and people ... It still goes on. And so, it\u2019s ... you know, largely because he happens to be the president of the United States, so you really can\u2019t avoid the president of the United States. Right, I wish he would heal ... I wish he would say healing things, but he never does.Why do you imagine he would?I don\u2019t, I would like that. But it will never happen.No.But it will be nice.Yes, but, did you ever watch \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d? Because I did.Yeah. Yeah, did he ever say anything nice on it?No, I mean, I understand what you\u2019re saying.Yeah, he\u2019s never \u2026 I\u2019m just saying it would be nice if somebody said like, \u201cHey!\u201d Because on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d did you hear him talk on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d anybody? Where she was like, she said something to that effect. Like, what about, you always talk badly about the Democrats. And he said something negative again to that, her question, about the Democrats. And you\u2019re just looking for him to say ... when she says the word, Democrats, she\u2019s talking about a hundred million people, you know? If you divide, you know ... and he just won\u2019t say anything nice about the hundred million people who live in this country who aren\u2019t Republican. Yeah.It\u2019s astonishing. Just that fact.Really? The only part of it that is astonishing to me is that there are people who are surprised by it, his behavior.No, I got it. I\u2019m on board with just how crazy it is.He just will never say anything nice. It\u2019s really fascinating \u2018cause they go, you know you were saying before, this time, now he\u2019s ... people are finally gonna get sick of this.Right, and they don\u2019t. They eat it up.No, they don\u2019t. That\u2019s a bummer.And they believe what they believe. And they think the same about us.Would you ever run for office?God, could you imagine?Yes.I actually sat there, on the couch when it was all happening, on Election Day in 2016, and I said out loud, I go ... when he won, I go, \u201cThis means I literally could be president.\u201d I literally ... I seriously could be president of the United States.It\u2019s Jack.Anybody can. Yeah, anybody can.Yeah. I don\u2019t know about that, he\u2019s pretty famous. I think he got very famous during \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on NBC.No, I know, but I\u2019m saying: He has no experience.Of course not, yes.So, in that sense, anybody could.Yeah, I said ... yes. Also, Tom Hanks, for example. You must encourage your friend to do so. It should be funny.Yeah! He would be ... yeah, I wish he would. I think actually we should have not-actors being presidents. That\u2019s my feeling. Anyway. Another question, any other questions? Right here.Audience member: Can you speak to how the revenue model has changed from the production side, from the traditional network television to these platforms like Netflix or Amazon?Sean Hayes: Yeah, it\u2019s really disheartening. Are you in the biz at all? No? Yeah, it\u2019s ... You know, like I said before, you\u2019re constantly trying to figure out how to increase revenue through a platform \u2014 like these guys have about ownership \u2014 and so you try to subsidize in other ways by creating podcasts or whatever you can before they get on board and suffocate us that way. But, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the answer. I don\u2019t know. But, you know, a little company like ours is always trying to figure out how to increase revenue. And it\u2019s all about ownership, so we have to figure that out.Ownership, meaning you have the show, so ...You have to own part or all of the show.Right, exactly. That\u2019s exactly right. Or you have to figure out if you\u2019re going to do a distribution, what\u2019s worth it. Or you use the different platforms ...Yeah, because they own the distributing, right, and they have the upper hand in everything because they\u2019re writing the check. Anybody, anywhere, that writes the check for anything, has the most power.Did you ever think of taking venture money? To do different options?We\u2019re talking about that.Right, I\u2019m curious, lots of people have not done that yet.Yeah and there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s happening that I can\u2019t really discuss.But you see, you see that happening. I was just interviewing the Sweetgreen guy, sitting on $122 million in venture capital, for the first time in ...For who?Venture captial is from Silicon Valley.I know, for what though?Sweetgreen. The food ...Oh, Sweetgreen, yeah.You know, the chain.Yeah.That\u2019s a lot of money, $122 million.That is a lot of money.To expand and create their business. And that\u2019s venture money and the first time that it\u2019s really been applied to fast food. You know, usually it\u2019s a different kind of thing.Yeah. What about water? Are you going to invest in water?Water?Yeah.What do you mean, water?Haven\u2019t you read about that? People investing in water?No. Water what?The stuff you drink.Yes I know what water is. Thank you. Yeah, how investing? I have not heard about this.Because that ... We\u2019re gonna need that ... Global warming and ....Yeah. Isn\u2019t that the plot to an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, when he lived on Mars? That was.Yes, what was that movie.Yes, Red\u2026 what was it? It\u2019s the plot.What was that movie, anybody?Controlling water on Mars.\u201cTotal Recall.\u201d\u201cTotal Recall,\u201d that\u2019s exactly the plot.Which is what I just did to think of the ...Yes. Yeah, we\u2019re gonna run out of water, but you and I will be long dead, so what\u2019s the difference?We will have cases of it in our garage.Garage, something like that. Right, any other questions? Any other questions? Right here.Speaker 3: When you\u2019re choosing what to produce, is it just content that you personally would like to watch? Or how do you pick?We ... yes, part of our edict is that. And our mission is to create things that only we watch and it has to have comedy, even if it\u2019s a drama. Has to have a little bit of comedy. But it has to be something we\u2019d watch, yeah. For sure.And finally, any other questions? Any other questions? Oh, right here.Speaker 4: What\u2019s your favorite thing about being \u201cjust Jack?\u201dI love the character Jack because there are no rules. You can ... He lives in almost an alternate universe where he can act and be and say almost anything. He can go from job to job to job. And it\u2019s always funny to me what the writers came up with. I mean ... And it\u2019s, you know ... A lot of actors shy away from the thing that made them famous, which I think does a disservice to them and their fans.Right.So I kind of was like that, maybe 15 years ago. I was like, I\u2019m gonna show the world that I\u2019m an actor and not wanting to talk about Jack. Now, of course, I embrace it wholeheartedly, because you guys do. And the audience does and I know ...And you\u2019re a little like that.What\u2019s that?You\u2019re a little like that.Yes, of course cause I play him, so ...Right.... There\u2019s a lot, there\u2019s a big part of me that\u2019s like Jack. But most of it, I\u2019m not anywhere near.Right, but I mean ...I\u2019m married, I\u2019m boring, I am ... I have a business mind as well and you know.He has a business mind.It\u2019s going really well for him.Yeah, exactly.It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not, is the joke.I\u2019m just curious, do you have a favorite episode? I remember when you were talking to your son and they had the boarding ...At the conversion camp?Jane Lynch was in it.Did you notice the painting of Pence in the background?No, what?Yeah, they had a painting of Mike Pence in the background at the conversion camp.Really? I need to go back and watch that. I missed that.Last year\u2019s episode is called, \u201cGrandpa Jack\u201d and Jack finds out he\u2019s actually a grandfather, which is hilarious.Right.And his parents, which is Jack\u2019s son, Elliot. So, Jack\u2019s son Elliot and his wife are from Texas and they\u2019re taking their kid to a conversion camp, because the kid\u2019s gay.Right.And then, at the conversion camp, there\u2019s a painting of Mike Pence and ...Jane Lynch and Andrew ...And I go down there, I give this big speech about how it\u2019s okay to be you, you create your own family wherever you go and blah blah blah.Right, that was a great episode.Yeah, I love that episode.It was really wonderful.From long, long time ago probably, the Cher one was ... And also where I come in, I\u2019m high on coffee and I talk really fast.Okay, good. Okay, last question. What do you imagine you\u2019re going to be doing in 10 years?I love that question. I have no idea and I love not knowing. But, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have a job behind a desk, because I would go crazy. I think I have to create, always something. We have a children\u2019s book coming out called \u201cPlum.\u201dReally?That my husband Scotty and I wrote. It\u2019s how the Sugar Plum Fairy got her wings, because I\u2019ve been fascinated with the \u201cNutcracker\u201d ever since I was a kid.Really?I memorized every note.Have you seen the new movie? The new Disney movie?No, but isn\u2019t it ironic?It\u2019s coming out.Crazy timing?Yeah. And so, I know every single note.Looks beautiful, actually.It does look beautiful. I know every note of the \u201cNutcracker,\u201d and I was wondering where do their people come from? Where\u2019s their origin stories? Because it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like a story on acid. It\u2019s like \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d Yeah, it is.It\u2019s like the Prince is fighting and Mouse King, like, what\u2019s happening?Right.Right, so ...Why are you obsessed with the \u201cNutcracker\u201d? That\u2019s so interesting.As a kid, I listened to it over and over and over again.Really?I know every single note. When I say every note, I know every note of every instrument of every song in the ballet.Wow, that\u2019s astonishing.I memorized it. I could do it for you now, if you want.No, thank you, okay, because ...And, so anyway, I\u2019ve been obsessed with it so that ... so I was doing Broadway. I was doing \u201cAn Act of God\u201d on Broadway ...Yes, which is where we met.Yes, where we met. And, during the day, I didn\u2019t have anything to do, can\u2019t sit still.Yeah.I have to look at myself.Right. Okay, got that.So I said, \u201cScotty, let\u2019s write a children\u2019s book.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cGreat!\u201d Three months later, we wrote a children\u2019s book. Two years later, it\u2019s out.Wow, so it\u2019s coming out for the ...It\u2019s coming out tomorrow.Tomorrow? Oh my goodness! Well, congratulations on that.Thank you.I like the \u201cNutcracker,\u201d but I took my kids once to see it. Which they didn\u2019t appreciate, I can tell you that. Is that the end of the story, like you get stuff? Five things you get sent?No, but we were walking out and a woman turns to the other woman, as we were walking out and said, \u201cAh, one more \u2018Nutcracker\u2019 closer to death.\u201d  What?! Wait a minute, what? What does that mean? Like we saw ...Meaning, like you go to see it, like Christmases, or something. Everyone goes. \u201cOne more \u2018Nutcracker\u2019 closer to death!\u201d Honey, that\u2019s hilarious.I know! I thought it was ... it was my favorite moment. I was like, she\u2019s 100 percent right.One more \u201cNutcracker\u201d closer to death. That\u2019s actually the logline of our book. So, we\u2019re gonna sell a lot to children. Anyway, thank you so much for doing this show.You\u2019re the best, I love you very much.Thank you for coming out to this.Thank you guys.Thanks, and when you do your podcast, I will come on your podcast.I would love that.That would be really good, I\u2019m excited, we\u2019re excited for him to do one, too.
