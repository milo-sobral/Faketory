{"id": "Amazon\u2019s booming ad business is both a blessing and a risk", "paragraph": "Amazon\u2019s business unit that primarily consists of advertising revenue registered another booming quarter this summer, growing to nearly $2.5 billion in sales during the three-month period, as Amazon announced yesterday in its third-quarter results.The ad division\u2019s fat profit margin \u2014 analysts estimate it could be as large as 75 percent \u2014 is a big reason why Amazon posted its largest quarterly profit ever in the third quarter. It\u2019s also a big reason why the slowing growth of Amazon\u2019s core online retail business isn\u2019t a giant story in tech right now.But Amazon\u2019s ad business, for all its glitz and hype, does not come without significant risk: Namely, that an over-reliance on ads will ruin the Amazon shopping experience.As my colleague Rani Molla chronicled recently, the top of search result pages on Amazon are increasingly stuffed with ads as well as custom placements hawking Amazon\u2019s own brands. When searching on Amazon\u2019s mobile app, it is not uncommon to have to scroll to a complete second screen to find the first search result that is not an ad.Her report also noted that nearly 8 percent of views on Amazon product pages came from sponsored links in May, more than double what it was a year earlier, according to data from the analytics firm Jumpshot,\u201cThey will need to pull back or they are going to see shoppers recede,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, CEO of Boomerang Commerce, a startup that makes software tools to help brands grow their business on Amazon in an automated fashion through advertising and other methods. Hariharan worked for nearly six years at Amazon earlier in his career.On an earnings conference call today, an analyst asked Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky whether the company\u2019s shopping sites were fully saturated with ads.\u201cAs far as penetration, we don\u2019t have that quantified for you,\u201d Olsavsky said, \u201cbut we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options.\u201dIndeed.The brilliance of Amazon lies in its cold efficiency. Search, click, buy. Repeat.Not search, scroll, scroll, scroll, click, click, buy.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
