{"id": "Paul Allen\u2019s sister has been tasked to do a surprisingly hard thing: Give away billions of dollars", "paragraph": "The death of tech icon Paul Allen this month is a daunting and potentially really revealing moment in the world of big money.When he died on Oct. 15, the 21st most-wealthy person in the world was sitting on more than $20 billion in assets \u2014 a fortune that now has a steward: Allen\u2019s sister, Jody. The former CEO of her late brother\u2019s umbrella company, Vulcan, Jody Allen isn\u2019t someone most people have heard of, but she\u2019ll wield enormous power in the next few years as she decides how the deceased Microsoft co-founder will honor The Giving Pledge \u2014 a commitment to philanthropy that will be tested with Allen\u2019s death.\u201cI have been given the great responsibility to steward Paul\u2019s wealth in service of his vision for the future,\u201d Jody Allen said in a statement. \u201cWhile the loss of Paul is overwhelming, I am dedicated to preserving and implementing Paul\u2019s vision.\u201dHere\u2019s why this will be so hard: Allen, who died single and with no kids, is believed to be the wealthiest signer of The Giving Pledge to die. The Giving Pledge is a commitment for donors to give away more than half of their assets to charity in life or in their wills, but it is only a commitment. There is nothing binding about it.But this will be one of the most interesting things to watch \u2014 and, given the amount of money involved, consequential for the world \u2014 in the business and philanthropy world over the next few years. And all of this will play out during a time when the tech industry\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful are struggling with questions about their corporate and personal responsibilities. Allen\u2019s representatives have said he gave away $2 billion in his lifetime, leaving billions of dollars that Bill Gates\u2019s co-founder needs to find a way to part with. (The exact amount depends on whether his net worth should be evaluated at the time of his death or at the time he signed the pledge in 2010 \u2014 which, as The Atlantic points out, was considerably less at only $13.5 billion. So despite his best efforts, he\u2019s trending in the wrong direction.) Allen will also, of course, have to pay billions in an estate tax.It is not easy to give away that much money so quickly, although winding down an estate is a years-long task. Tied for the largest gift ever to a specific U.S. college or university, for instance, is a $600 million check to the California Institute of Technology in 2001 from the founder of Intel, Gordon Moore, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.Allen was a towering figure in Seattle, in part because of his ownership of the Seattle Seahawks. So his estate will be under scrutiny. But his family could also effectively ignore \u2014 or maybe just fudge a little \u2014 The Giving Pledge. Perhaps, because Allen died at the young age of 65, they might find a way to satisfy the spirit of the pledge without disbursing his fortune immediately.Anything like that would embolden skeptics of The Giving Pledge, who question whether the declaration, even if it\u2019s public, has enough teeth to actually coax billionaires into giving. Allen\u2019s aides haven\u2019t yet outlined what his posthumous giving will look like, beyond saying that after his death that he was \u201cthoughtful\u201d during his life about how his work would continue after his passing.\u201cI believe that those fortunate to achieve great wealth should put it to work for the good of humanity,\u201d Allen wrote in 2010 in his Giving Pledge letter. \u201cOur net worth is ultimately defined not by dollars but rather by how well we serve others.\u201dSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
