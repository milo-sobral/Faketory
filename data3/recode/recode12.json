{"id": "Twitter is about to tell us if it lost millions of users. Does that really mean its plan is working?", "paragraph": "When Twitter reports its third-quarter results early Thursday morning, don\u2019t be surprised if it lost millions of users over the past three months \u2014 or that the company says that\u2019s a good thing.In July, Twitter announced a decrease of one million monthly active users for the second quarter, and warned investors that things would be even worse in the third quarter. RBC Capital\u2019s Mark Mahaney thinks Twitter lost five million users in Q3, which would bring the company\u2019s total to 330 million, down from its peak of 336 million earlier this year.It\u2019s a bad sign when any company loses users. It\u2019s even worse when that company is an advertising company that relies on impressions and scale to grow its business.But in Twitter\u2019s case, the company has framed this decline as a sign that it is getting healthier. Some of the user decline surely came because Twitter removed some bot and spam accounts \u2014 no doubt, a good thing to remove. But the company also said that its cleanup efforts are so extensive that they are taking resources away from other products and initiatives that would normally lead to more growth.\u201cWe are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility,\u201d CEO Jack Dorsey explained at the time. \u201cWe do believe, ultimately over time, that this will help our growth story.\u201dIt\u2019s the ultimate \u201cone step back, two steps forward\u201d kind of approach, and in some ways it\u2019s believable. If Twitter can clean up its service, and people feel safer interacting with others on the service as a result, it could lead to more users in the long run, and more advertisers who want to spend money to reach those users. The tough part about believing in this idea is that the company\u2019s \u201chighest priority\u201d \u2014 creating \u201chealthier\u201d conversations on the service \u2014 is hard to measure, at least right now. That forces investors to decide whether Twitter\u2019s user decline is just the temporary cost of cleaning up the service, or a sign of even deeper problems. It\u2019s possible we won\u2019t know for a while.Twitter hopes to quantify its health some day, but it\u2019s unclear if or when that will actually happen. For now, the closest thing Twitter has is its daily user growth metric. If more people are using Twitter every day, perhaps it\u2019s because Twitter isn\u2019t the toxic wasteland it once was. Or perhaps that growth is the result of something else. Maybe we\u2019ll find out on Thursday. Why does this matter? As an advertising business, the size of Twitter\u2019s user base is arguably its most important metric that doesn\u2019t start with a dollar sign. How many people can Twitter target with ads? And is that number of people growing? The answers to those two questions can give you a pretty good idea of how Twitter\u2019s business is doing.But things are rarely that simple with Twitter, and the company\u2019s user-growth story has been an ever-evolving tale. Twitter used to measure itself solely on monthly active users, the same basic metric used by Facebook. But that metric hasn\u2019t been very kind to Twitter for a couple of reasons: Facebook\u2019s user base is much bigger, and Twitter hasn\u2019t grown nearly as fast \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s shrinking.So Twitter has tried over the years to talk about user growth in other ways. There was a time it talked about its \u201clogged out\u201d audience \u2014 how many people see tweets, even if they don\u2019t have an account. More recently, it started to talk about its daily user growth, though the company doesn\u2019t actually say how many daily users it has.This latest narrative \u2014 Twitter is shrinking because it\u2019s getting healthier! \u2014 seems the hardest to accept. And while Twitter\u2019s stock was doing great a few months ago, it\u2019s now down about 40 percent from early July.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
