{"id": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Saudi money crisis illustrates a decline of \u2018moral leadership\u2019 in America", "paragraph": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are swimming in billions of dollars invested by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman \u2014 a heavy financial backer of SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund \u2014 who is now accused of ordering the torture and assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\u201cAnywhere you tug, at any company or any investment firm or any VC, there is either Saudi money or there\u2019s questionable money everywhere, across the system,\u201d Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher said on the latest episode of Pivot. \u201cAnd if you remove the Saudis from the worldwide global network, everything collapses.\u201dHer co-host, NYU\u2019s Scott Galloway, said the silence of most tech leaders \u2014 and, even more importantly, the slow and muddled response from Washington \u2014 are indicative of a crisis in morality that will bite businesses in the end.\u201cWe have put a price on moral leadership,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cAnd the presidents of the past have always tried to figure out the balance between the realpolitik and our strategic interest. This isn\u2019t new. But we at least pretended to care ... And by the way, I think this is the same infection that has caused illness across all of Big Tech: We\u2019re trading off long-term moral leadership in exchange for short-term profits.\u201cThe reason why we have inflows of capital, the reason why our publicly traded stocks traded at 19 times PE, not 11 or 12 in other markets, is because we have rule of law and some sense of moral leadership here,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd when we engage or traffic in bone saws, we are long-term trading off our brand and the margin power that comes from our brand. So this is not only the wrong thing to do, it\u2019s economically a stupid thing to do.\u201dYou can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott\u2019s latest episode.Kara Swisher: Hi everyone, this is Pivot, from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I\u2019m Kara Swisher. Scott Galloway: And I\u2019m Scott Galloway, coming to you live from one of the 19 cities that has been played and will not be HQ2, Kara. Chicago. This is at Amazon, right? Correct?Got it. That\u2019s right. I like Chicago, it\u2019s one of my favorite places. 80 percent of New York for 50 percent of the price, it\u2019s the Old Navy of cities. All right, let\u2019s get started. Let\u2019s get right to the big story this week. And it\u2019s also had so many implications in tech, which is the Saudi money toxically awash in Silicon Valley and how tech companies are responding to the disappearance of the journalist at the Saudi embassy \u2014 not the disappearance, the murder of a journalist at the Saudi embassy by the Saudis, which I think most American intelligence, all the reports are coming in, that this is what\u2019s happened. And the presence of Saudi money in Silicon Valley. So let\u2019s talk about it. So last week, Kara, you said you couldn\u2019t get anybody to comment. What\u2019s happened between now and then? What is the response, what are they saying on the ground out there?Well, what\u2019s really interesting, I had a really interesting dinner with a lot of people who are involved in this stuff, and there\u2019s a couple things, there\u2019s a few things. One is that there\u2019s been dirty money here for a long time, whether it was Russian money, and the fact that it\u2019s not just Saudi money, it\u2019s all kinds of money from the Middle East, that is really problematic, not just sovereign wealth but individual wealth, because there\u2019s so many wealthy people, they just washed into this area. And lately it has been money from the Mideast, comparatively. And then there\u2019s Chinese money, there\u2019s all kinds of different things going on, and they were all talking about where the different money is moving in, which was fascinating to me, and there were several people who were involved in these things. One of the issues is, first of all, the first thing they did, they said they\u2019re not gonna go to \u201cDavos in the Desert,\u201d this event that MBS has, the head of Saudi Arabia, the crown prince has. It\u2019s Mohammad bin Salman, is his name. Right now, everybody is calling him Mohammad Bone Saw. I know, awful, it\u2019s an internet meme right now, but I think fine, that\u2019s good with me. So they were talking about whether they were going. A lot of them had gotten out. The first one was Dara Khosrowshahi, who is the CEO of Uber, and he was gonna attend this and now he\u2019s not going. He was one of the first to declare that. That said, he has not returned the $14 billion that they got, half of which was Saudi money, from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund. I think a lot of people are focused on the Vision Fund, which was the big fund that SoftBank raised, and they were about to raise another hundred-billion dollar fund, which was an unheard of fund, which has been throwing money at everybody, from Slack to WeWork to Wag, which is a dog-walking app. $300 million to the dog-walking app. So half of that is ... 45 percent of that fund, $45 billion, is from the Saudis. So anything, if Uber\u2019s gotten $13-14 billion, then $7 billion is from the Saudis, essentially, from the public investment fund that they have, which is called PIF. So nobody\u2019s giving the money back, let\u2019s just say, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And nobody wants to think about that idea. Now, whether they\u2019re going to take it from them going forward, that\u2019s the big question. Yeah. Do you think it\u2019s realistic or even a reasonable ask to say, \u201cGive the money back\u201d?No. That\u2019s not gonna happen. Yeah. That\u2019s not gonna happen. You know what\u2019s an opportunity here, Kara, I think SoftBank, which by the way, in the ecosystem, at least in New York, is showing up with a very, very big stick. Whereas these VCs with only billion dollar funds might offer you $30 million at a pre- of $60 [million], they show up and say, \u201cWe\u2019ll put in $100 at a pre of $150.\u201d And they were literally muscling around U.S. venture capitalists. They are. And they\u2019re taking a lot of the companies, they\u2019re taking 40 percent of the company. I think it\u2019ll be interesting, because they have been a little muscle-y, I would say, and I think a lot of people don\u2019t like it, but how can you ... What they have done is gone and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take my $300 million, I\u2019ll go and give it to your competitor,\u201d and they\u2019re very aggressive, they\u2019re an aggressive group of people. And this is Masa Son, who is head of SoftBank. But I\u2019ll be interested to see what\u2019s going to happen going forward. Nobody is giving the money back. And a company like Slack, Stewart Butterfield who\u2019s the CEO there, he usually calls back and he has not called back. So I think everyone at dinner was horrified and embarrassed, and at the same time, the money was not being returned, and they were making the point that anywhere you tug, at any company or any investment firm or any VC, there is either Saudi money or there\u2019s questionable money everywhere, across the system. And if you remove the Saudis from the worldwide global network, everything collapses, because this is where much of the investment money ... And they\u2019re trying to obviously buy influence in technology. And it\u2019s working. Yes. Go ahead. The reality is, people 10 times as important as you and me can be murdered and dismembered with a bone saw, as long as you\u2019re buying a bunch of aircraft carriers or submarines. We\u2019ve basically put a price on ... I don\u2019t know this, but I would speculate the conversation post- this event between Pompeo and Trump and the Saudi government there was like, \u201cYou guys obviously screwed up, we had nothing to do with this, but if you want us to be co-conspirators in the coverup, you\u2019re gonna have to buy another 130 tanks,\u201d or whatever it might be. We have put a price on moral leadership. And the presidents of the past have always tried to figure out the balance between the realpolitik and our strategic interest. This isn\u2019t new. But we at least pretended to care, we at least said, \u201cOkay, anything involving a bone saw, it\u2019s time,\u201d or I think it\u2019s time, anything involving a bone saw... And by the way, I think this is the same infection that has called illness across all of Big Tech, we\u2019re trading off long-term moral leadership in exchange for short-term profits. Well, it is. It\u2019s interesting, but this is where the money is coming from. This is where the wealth is, this is where it is. So there\u2019s two questions that people are going to be asking. Do they need this much money, do they need the $300? They probably don\u2019t, they were fine with the smaller amount. They didn\u2019t need it, but everybody feels like they need to have these war chests. They were like, if they have to have the war chest, we have to have the war chest. So that\u2019s how these things escalate. And the question is, what companies are going to go, \u201cNo?\u201d One interesting thing was, the previous Saudi investor was ... I can\u2019t remember all their names, but he was an investor. He had Kingdom Holdings, and he was investing in Twitter, or Apple or different things like that, and he was just a basic investor, it wasn\u2019t this PIF thing that was going on. And he was considered the \u201cgood\u201d investor, essentially. He was one of the ones that was jailed at the Ritz, and then MBS took everybody\u2019s money there. He basically took hostage money, I guess, from them. And some of that is what\u2019s now flowing into Silicon Valley, which is fascinating. Of all the people that were jailed at the Ritz-Carlton, which is a strange thing to say. What the key part is is that Silicon Valley cannot say it didn\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t know where this is from. Yeah. It\u2019s 100 percent true. But I would argue that the companies, granted, are complicit in it, but at the end of the day, because of the structure of our capital markets, companies have a very difficult time not thinking short-term. But the reason we give 23 cents on the dollar to our government is we pay them to think long term. And the ultimate reason that people buy Fords or have bought Fords is not because they were better cars, but because it reflected a belief in the middle class. The reason people buy Nikes is it\u2019s about elite excellence can bring you to the highest echelons of performance and recognition. And the reason why we have inflows of capital, the reason why our publicly traded stocks traded at 19 times PE, not 11 or 12 in other markets, is because we have rule of law and some sense of moral leadership here. And when we engage or traffic in bone saws, we are long-term trading off our brand and the margin power that comes from our brand. So this is not only the wrong thing to do, it\u2019s economically a stupid thing to do. I would agree. But one of the things that\u2019s interesting, the Saudis also have a lot of money in the stock market. So they own 5 percent of Tesla. Look, Elon Musk can\u2019t stop them from doing it, although he was talking to the Saudis, as you know, when he did the \u201cfunding secured\u201d [tweet]. That\u2019s the PIF, who he was talking about. So that\u2019s interesting. But Apple can\u2019t help it, I think the Saudis own 30 percent of Snapchat at this point. There\u2019s an enormous stake that they have, PIF does. It\u2019s a large amount of a lot of these tech companies, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been buying into. Now, those you can\u2019t prevent, it\u2019s an open market situation. But you certainly can, even if these are your investors, say something. And most of these companies have said nothing, really. The strongest was Dara Khosrowshahi, but he has to because he has so much other money. And I think Sam Altman, who was an investor at Y Combinator, did say he\u2019s not going to the Davos in the Desert event, whatever it\u2019s called, but it\u2019s the PIF thing. And a lot of people have pulled out. Steve Mnuchin\u2019s still going, I think he\u2019s going, right? Shocker.[editor\u2019s note: shortly before this podcast was recorded, Mnuchin dropped out of the event]I think it\u2019s him and ... that\u2019s all that\u2019s going. But I know all the tech people are definitely not going now, and they can\u2019t show up there. But there\u2019s got to be another step, they\u2019ve got to start saying something like, they have to make some declaration even if they\u2019re not gonna give the money back, but they haven\u2019t. And this is the whole trend, is they now have to make declarations on everything. On everything that happens now, companies are on the hook for saying something. In this case, it\u2019s such a bright line between what they have to say and how much money they\u2019re taking from them. It\u2019s unavoidable. So I\u2019m gonna keep bugging them. Anyway. But it\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s an opportunity for SoftBank. I think one of the ultimate brand moves of the past year was actually at the World Cup, where the Japanese soccer team, a national team, after a crushing defeat at the hands of Belgium and Romulu Lucaccu \u2014 one of the most underrated strikers in the world, but that\u2019s another story.Please don\u2019t tell it to me. You know what they did? They cleaned up their dressing room, and they stuck behind and helped the fans and the workers clean up the stadium, and then they wrote a thank-you note. And I think we have unfortunately an ability, we can\u2019t not stereotype organizations by their national identity. And I think SoftBank has the opportunity here to say, \u201cThe way we roll in Japan is we\u2019re just a little bit more dignified, we\u2019re a little bit more polite, we\u2019re a little bit more honorable,\u201d and to not accept that money and take the fund down from $200 billion to 120. Masa Son has not said a word. It\u2019s an opportunity. I think he\u2019s listening. I don\u2019t think he is, I think he\u2019ll say nothing. And Masa Son, I think this is an opportunity. We\u2019ll see about that. Anyway, by the way, I have a Ford Fiesta, Scott, just so you know. I just can\u2019t even imagine that. It\u2019s a lawnmower with doors. We gotta get you out of that thing for safety reasons. I have a turbo stick shift, so let\u2019s just try again, it\u2019s a sports car. Turbo stick shift?That\u2019s right, it\u2019s very fast. You\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll drive it when you\u2019re here with me, we\u2019ll go around, it\u2019ll be great. We\u2019ll do Pivot from my ...I would have an elbow sticking out of each window. That would look ridiculous. No, you and I are going for a ride in my turbo. Everybody makes fun of my Ford Fiesta, and they get in it and drive, and they go, \u201cOh, this is a great car.\u201d Just so you know. That\u2019s cause they\u2019re kissing your ass, Kara. They don\u2019t really think that.It\u2019s not, you\u2019re gonna see, it\u2019s gonna be great. That\u2019s an awful car. We\u2019re gonna do Pivot from the Ford Fiesta and we\u2019re gonna get Ford to be our sponsor. You see, this is how this works. Anyway, let\u2019s talk about something positive, a win of the week, because it\u2019s been a crappy week, it\u2019s a shitty week. So we\u2019ve lost all over the place in the Saudi situation. Who\u2019s your winner?No, what is your winner? What is your winner?My big winner? I have two. Okay. There was a wonderful article in the New York Times about a gentleman who was the head of the Japanese consulate in Lithuania during World War II and it ends up that him defying his government and refusing to stop signing and writing visas, literally until he could no longer write, and then when he was extracted from Lithuania, writing these visas for Jews who were trying to get to Japan and then to somewhere else. He, on his train ride out, was literally throwing visas out the window. And they\u2019ve done some research and it ends up that this gentleman, Chiune Sugihara, likely saved 6,000 Jews, possibly 40,000 who are alive today. It\u2019s a wonderful story of moral leadership in the face of adversity, moral heroism. Moral. There\u2019s been some interesting research here that moral heroism stems from some of the same attributes, the rebelliousness that creates great entrepreneurs, and it\u2019s just a lesson for all of us. It\u2019s pretty obvious what the right thing to do is, sometimes it\u2019s really, really hard. And this guy saved ... 40,000 alive today because of this guy. Just an inspiring story. And my second is Nike, who made ...You love that Nike. I\u2019m so into Nike right now. Okay. I didn\u2019t much like their sexual harassment stuff, but go ahead, move along. Rain on my parade, seriously. Just, I feel shamed. All right, go ahead, what did Nike do? So Justin Gallegos, a runner with cerebral palsy, who\u2019s a pretty serious runner ...I feel bad, okay. Nike showed up and endorsed him, made him an official Nike athlete. And there\u2019s this fantastic two-minute film on it. Granted, it\u2019s commercial and sappy and soft lighting, soft music. But my feeling is the basis, and the wonderful thing about capitalism is as we pursue economic interests for us and our families, really wonderful things can happen. And I think this was such a wonderful thing. Scott, you\u2019re such a softie. What, did you put the afghan around you and have marshmallows and cocoa? This is lovely, this is beautiful, I\u2019m crying. Kara, hold me. Let me just, no, I will not. Thank you. Once again, crossing a line. In the Fiesta. Crossing that line, never changes, you. Listen, I had a win for the week. We were liking that Facebook had a tougher ban on false information posts, but of course what happened on Recode this week is they introduced the Portal, which we talked about last week.You guys broke this. Yes. When they said they introduced it, \u201cNo, no, we\u2019re not using the data for ad targeting,\u201d and then they called us back and what did they do?What do you know? Yeah, apps and who you\u2019re calling, right?Yes. We are using the data for our targeting. Which was like, for one brief second, we were like, \u201cOkay, we don\u2019t love their surveillance device, but at least they\u2019re not using it for ads.\u201d And then they were. That was just awful, I have to tell you, just awful. But you know these guys, I don\u2019t. What happened? I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just throw it in the trash. They waited six months to put out the Portal and then they just did it right in the middle of a hurricane of privacy, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there. Have you heard anything about initial sales or reception in the marketplace, have you heard anything?All I know is literally I had a table full of internet people say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would put a dancing Facebook surveillance device in my home.\u201d So I don\u2019t know. And this was the, these people would buy it, but nobody at this dinner party was buying it. You know these guys, I don\u2019t. What do you think happened, that they knew they were targeting and then they lied to you and said, \u201cOkay, what do we do, we\u2019ve lied, do we let the lie hold or do we have to ...?\u201d Was it incompetence or deception? I don\u2019t even know if it was a lie. They said one thing, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t think they were lying. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any information for you on this, it was just like, \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m telling you, Scott, they just have got to get it together down there, don\u2019t you think?I\u2019m so outraged I\u2019m going to go express my outrage on Instagram. I don\u2019t use it, I do not use Instagram. That\u2019s it. Take that, Facebook. \u201cInstagram is a museum,\u201d as my children say. Anyway, we\u2019re gonna go to predictions now. Mr. Galloway, some predictions?The individual throwing out the first pitch of the opening game for the Washington Nationals 2019 season is Jeffrey Bezos. Okay. Why is that? Explain. Imminently, they\u2019re gonna announce that the D.C. metro area is the location of the HQ2, reflecting that this entire shitshow circus HQ2 is nothing but a ruse. That a man worth $145 billion at the age of 54 gets to live where he wants, where the Bezoses want to live is D.C. They\u2019re coming to you. Do you know my ex-wife\u2019s house is like seven doors down from him? It\u2019s really interesting. So he\u2019ll be a neighbor. Really? Are they close, do they know each other?Yeah. We all know each other. We knew him when he was a little guy. Yeah, sure. We\u2019re not married anymore, but we\u2019re friends, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be going over for tea. I don\u2019t see that happening. But neighbors, in this crazy neighborhood. I heard the house was bigger than the Museum of Natural History, it\u2019s just enormous. My ex worked for Google, she\u2019s got a big house. So does he. They\u2019re all big. They\u2019re all these big ... they look like the Bulgarian embassy, that\u2019s what it looks like. They all do, every one. They\u2019re big. They\u2019re just big Washington houses, then they look like embassies, every one of them in that neighborhood. It\u2019s called Kalorama. Obama lives there, Ivanka lives there, Rex Tillerson lived there, I think Mnuchin\u2019s somewhere wandering around. I\u2019d like to party with Tillerson. Yeah. Would you?Yeah. I think he, me and Zach Braff would just slay it in Adams Morgan. A few beers, me and Rex and chili. Where did Zach Braff come in? Oh my goodness. He\u2019s always a good third partner when you\u2019re rolling. He\u2019s always a good third partner. Okay. All right. So you think he\u2019s gonna pick Maryland, Virginia, for that thing. Oh, by the way, I have some insight, you get all the scoop. I was on the train back from D.C. and I saw, gosh, this really good guy, the [founding] dean of Cornell Business School, [Daniel] Huttenlocher, he\u2019s on the board of Amazon, and I immediately thought, okay, that means he was down there extracting a pound of flesh from Mark Warner or someone in Virginia. Anyways, that\u2019s my prediction. What\u2019s your prediction? Okay. I think Maryland is probably a very good bet, and second backup is Pittsburgh. That would be my guess. You think there\u2019s a backlash when everyone realizes they\u2019ve been played?No. Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cOh well, I didn\u2019t win on that lottery ticket, let\u2019s try again next week.\u201d You know what I mean? I just think the whole thing ... to give one of the world\u2019s richest men a tax break is always an enjoyable thing to watch. Isn\u2019t it cute, though, how Indianapolis and Columbus actually think they have a chance? Isn\u2019t that just adorable, if they think the wealthiest man in the world, who doesn\u2019t need to spend 12 minutes much less 12 weeks a year in Indianapolis, is going to decide to put his HQ2 there? I think it\u2019s just so cute. One can dream. One has hopes and dreams and things like that. Yeah, I think it\u2019s probably gonna be located there. The only other option is if he picks a Canadian city. Yeah, that\u2019ll happen. I\u2019m just saying. That\u2019ll happen. You never know. I\u2019m just gonna put it out there so I look smart, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Tied for first wealthiest person in the world is MacKenzie Bezos. After spending 10 months here in rainy Seattle, she\u2019s gonna be like, \u201cI know, we need to spend more time in Toronto\u201d? It\u2019s not gonna happen, Kara. And they\u2019re not going south, you\u2019re right. Yeah, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s a fair point. All right, okay. All right, well, we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s gonna be very soon. The dark horse is Miami, because I spoke after him at this JPMorgan Master of the Universe conference, and he was by the pool and I think he was really happy there. It\u2019s nice there. Isn\u2019t Miami great? Miami\u2019s a hell of a place. I\u2019ve been on the board of seven public companies, and I\u2019ve gone through four headquarter relocation processes, you know what it always comes down to, in retrospect?What?You find out the CEO cloaked business reasons in the decision, and the decision all came down to one thing and one thing only, Kara. What, a pool?Where the CEO wanted to spend more time. Where he was chairman of a golf club or where his next wife was living. I\u2019m gonna just leave it at that, except to say I love Miami. I always feel like doing something naughty when I\u2019m there. Anyway, all right. So Amazon ...In the Fiesta, you\u2019re rolling along Collins Avenue in your turbo Fiesta. Next week we\u2019re gonna talk about Uber\u2019s public offering. But not this week. I\u2019m gonna leave it at that, Scott, the second wife thing. And I have to get out of here. Did we miss anything? I think we\u2019re good, right? We\u2019re good. Yeah. This feels right as rain. Saudis and Jeff Bezos. I would describe you, the Fiesta and this show as a tall drink of lemonade with vodka. Okay. All right, I don\u2019t even know what that means. Thanks Scott, looking forward to talking again next week.
