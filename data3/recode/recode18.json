{"id": "Unlike some athletes, former NFL star Maurice Jones-Drew doesn\u2019t want to be a venture capitalist", "paragraph": "When he moved home to the San Francisco Bay Area for his final season in the NFL, Maurice Jones-Drew was thinking about playing football in front of his family \u2014 not turning himself into a big investor after he retired from the League.\u201cMy grandpa always used to always tell me, \u2018Dude, you\u2019re a football player,\u2019\u201d Jones-Drew said on the latest episode of Recode Media. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not an engineer. You\u2019re not an investor. You\u2019re none of this. Your whole life, you\u2019ve played football. You went to college, let\u2019s be honest, you went to UCLA, got a good education, but you went to play football, so be a football player.\u2019\u201dJones-Drew has made some tech investments, including in a VR company based near where he grew up, but these days he devotes most of his energy to analyzing football on the NFL Network and providing color commentary for the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 games. If he wanted to become a venture capitalist, though, he\u2019d fit the profile. Several NBA players \u2014 including former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, current Houston Rockets player Carmelo Anthony and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant \u2014 have all started tech investing funds, as has former San Francisco 49ers coach Joe Montana. But for Jones-Drew, a visit to the offices of Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park convinced him that he\u2019s not cut out for the VC life.\u201cMy concern with the investing is that it\u2019s such a low hit rate that it scares me,\u201d he told Recode\u2019s Kurt Wagner. \u201cI\u2019m real soft when it comes to that. I grew up with no money, so it\u2019s like, I got money, I\u2019m gonna try to keep it as long as I can. But they were talking about how they try to hit it like a 20 percent, 30 percent rate. If they hit, then they\u2019re happy.\u201dYou can listen to Recode Media wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Kurt\u2019s conversation with Maurice.Kurt Wagner: We are here in LA at NFL Network studios. I\u2019m with Maurice Jones-Drew, former Pro Bowler, NFL running back. Welcome to Recode Media.Maurice Jones-Drew: Thank you guys for having me. Yeah. MJD, I think you said is okay?It\u2019s perfectly fine. Okay, good. We\u2019re going to go with that. Welcome to the show. I was actually a little surprised that you were available now because it\u2019s Monday and \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d starts in like less than three hours. I don\u2019t know what a typical Monday is like around here, I imagine it\u2019s kind of chaos these last couple days? What\u2019s it like during the season? It\u2019s really not too bad on Mondays, it\u2019s more recap.Okay. Kind of looking over what happened on Sunday or Thursday. For me, it\u2019s my longest day because I do fantasy. I tape early in the mornings at 8:00 and then go all the way to about noon, then I get a two-hour break and then I come back, write a couple articles and get ready to do Monday night end game.So you\u2019re writing, on top of being on ...Oh yeah. You got to try to touch everything, do podcasts as well. So I try to do a little bit of everything. And respect because as someone who writes as well, I can tell you it can be very time-consuming. I didn\u2019t say in the intro but you are now a network analyst for NFL Network. You also do the Los Angeles Rams play by play \u2014 or sorry, color commentary. Color, yes. Tell me if you will, obviously it\u2019s kind of become common for ... Everyone who is a color analyst today is usually a former player. How does that process actually work?I think mine was much different. It\u2019s weird, the Rams just called my agent and was like, \u201cHey, we want to try Maurice out. If he wants to do it, you know, come and do it.\u201d I was like, \u201cAll right, cool, never did it before,\u201d and they were like, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it, we want ours to have a different flow to it than the normal, traditional way.\u201d And if you listen to our broadcast, it has a little bit of slang in there, a little different, much more, I guess, millennial, where we try to reach a younger crowd. Because the Rams, they do have an older crowd, but we have a lot of younger people that are joining up. Youngest coach in the NFL, right? Head coach?Yeah. Much younger than me, which is nice. Yeah. He\u2019s what 31, 32?I think he just turned 32, maybe. I don\u2019t remember exactly but it\u2019s just a different feel, and they wanted that because we\u2019re in LA and LA is a different vibe than most cities. So it was nice. The first couple times, I was horrible. God awful, pretty much.Was that something that you figured out on your own or did someone pull you aside and be like, \u201cHey man, you\u2019re pretty bad\u201d? No, no. I knew I was bad and I kind of went in there like, I\u2019m just trying to figure this out. But I have a great play-by-play guy, JB Long, who has done this a bunch and he\u2019s worked with a ton of people and it was really just getting comfortable with him, understanding him, and knowing what he\u2019s going to do and kind of learning him a little bit. After, I want to say maybe a couple weeks, six weeks or so, we were able to kind of find our groove and we just started to grow after that. It was funny, he took me to the side before one game and was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go work out together,\u201d and we went and worked out and we talked about a lot of different things. Nothing about the game. And it made it easier for me because now this is not necessarily a coworker of mine, this is like a friend of mine. Sure. We were just trying to move forward and so it was nice to have a guy who\u2019s been in this business, had done a ton of those things and to get advice from different people throughout the way. A lot of it, JB was just kind of like, \u201cBe yourself, say what you say, if you ever get stuck look at me, I\u2019ll coach you through it and then we\u2019ll be good.\u201d And from then on out, this is year three and we\u2019ve been having a ball since. Yeah. It\u2019s a tough job for sure, and people are supercritical online, as I\u2019m sure you have learned. What is something that maybe surprised you as a former player, once you\u2019re in the booth? Was there something that maybe you thought was going to be super easy or that was actually way harder than expected?Well, everything about broadcasting is about timing. So podcasts, you have hours and you can have sometimes you have segments that are minutes: Three, four, five minutes you can speak. When you\u2019re doing play by play or color, it\u2019s literally 15 seconds. Yeah.You form an idea or thought of what you just saw and then be able to spit it out quickly and then you have to get it out because then JB has to get in to describe the next play. That was all timing. And some of these teams, like you\u2019ll play ... Our first game was on Monday night against the Niners and Chip Kelly. No pressure. Right. And then literally, they\u2019re on the ball in two seconds and they\u2019re just going fast. So it was crazy but it was a lot of fun learning and understanding it. And now I have kind of my flow on what I feel and what I\u2019m comfortable with, as well as what JB\u2019s comfortable with, and we\u2019ve been able to kind of work together to make our own music, in a way. Yeah. And it works well for us. I think I read somewhere that in order to become even a TV personality ... There\u2019s some kind of training I imagine that you go through, I think I read something ... am I making this up? No. My road was different, so let me say that. Okay, yeah. What was your road? Maybe that\u2019s what I read about. So my road was, in college I had a teacher, we all kind of took remedial English when we first got there. You had to pass the class and they can move you on to different places. And this is at UCLA?At UCLA, yes. I went to all-boys Catholic [school] so I knew how to write and do all the different things. There were some kids that I went to school with that didn\u2019t know some of the basic principles of writing. The teacher saw that I was kind of advanced in those situations and she was like, \u201cWell, you know what? Let\u2019s have you speak in front of your peers.\u201d Learn to speak, right? You all play ball, you all have to be able to speak in front of the media and enunciate your words and not have this southern dialect. Sure. We had some guys from New Orleans with a different dialect that you could barely understand, some swamp people-type stuff. She told us that the hardest thing you can do was speak in front of your peers, like people that you know. Yeah.So every week, I\u2019d have to write something and then be able to regurgitate it in front of my boys and they\u2019d be throwing stuff at me or talking trash or laughing if I messed up. And it made me more comfortable because if I can do it in front of them, if I don\u2019t know you it\u2019s much easier. So when I got out of that, I actually got drafted to Jacksonville a couple years later. In Jacksonville, I had a radio show that I was able to practice and learn the arts of radio, which is completely different than TV. While you were playing, by the way. Yeah, while I was playing. Which is rare, right? I do not see a lot of players hold a regular radio show, TV show ...I have to give credit to my agent, Adisa Bakari, who kind of pushed me in that direction as well. So I had a radio ... and you have to answer the tough questions, which I felt comfortable answering those tough questions. There was a time where we were in the playoffs and a guy dropped a pass and people were like, \u201cOh if he didn\u2019t ...\u201d I\u2019m like look, it\u2019s easy to sit on your couch and say you would have caught that, right? Sure. But in the moment ... and I learned how to defend my teammates but also be critical in certain situations and still be honest. So doing TV and radio for two or three years, I did that. And then there was a play, we were playing the Jets, I took a knee on the goal line and thanked all my fantasy owners and then got a radio gig with the Sirius XM. Which for 10 years or eight years I had that, which went really well. Which also seems rare to me because I always feel like people or players, they don\u2019t love the fantasy thing. They don\u2019t love people coming up to them and being like, \u201cHey! You\u2019re on my fantasy team!\u201d but you\u2019re kind of leaning into that whole thing. Yeah, it didn\u2019t bother me. At the end of the day, it was a way for me and my buddies to still be able to communicate. Because I was on the east coast, they were on the west coast, right? So that was a way for us to keep our communication going and be able to talk and it forced us all to have a group chat and all this different stuff with it. It was nice. At the end of the day, people just want to compete anyway, so I saw it as such. Some guys didn\u2019t like it which is understandable. So, you don\u2019t have to. But I embraced it and enjoyed it and that\u2019s what really opened the door to where I am now. I had Sirius XM for I want to say six years while I was playing, or seven years while I was playing and then a year or two after, and we just finished that up because I took the Rams job and so I couldn\u2019t do both. It was just too much on my plate with NFL Network. Yeah. All those things are reps. Right. At the end of the day, just repping how to talk, how to do certain things, taking certain classes when I needed to, doing improv, which helps out a lot, right? Yeah.Be able to think on your toes, which helps out in some of these situations. Do you still do improv? Not as much. I just watch movies. Do you want to announce when your next improv show is ...Yeah, right. I wish. So all of us can come cheer you on. It would be funny. It was funny, a lot of people here didn\u2019t know I did improv, well, I took a couple classes. And for the most part, I\u2019ve always done improv because I\u2019d go out with my boys and we\u2019d always make stuff up that you have to kind of go with it. I did it for the network one time and people didn\u2019t know I could do it. It worked out well but you always try and perfect your craft. I think that\u2019s always a key, just like at running back, I always was training and watching and studying other people to figure out how to perfect my craft. I do the same here. Where I go to different classes, listen to different people speak, do a little public speaking sometimes which is pretty tough, and you just learn that each different type of speaking or broadcasting has a certain lane that you have to follow. I\u2019ve just kind of taken that and followed those rules and just put my own spin on it and here I am. One of the things that I\u2019m always both impressed by and also kind of makes me cringe is the former players who go out and have no problem being critical of your former teammates or current players. And I know that\u2019s part of the job, right? You are there to analyze. But how do you get comfortable with the idea of criticizing people, since you\u2019ve been in that scenario before? If you drop a pass, it\u2019s simple to say, you have to catch that pass, right? Sure. And that\u2019s where I kind of keep it. I don\u2019t really go into the personal, or like \u201cthis guy is a bad person,\u201d I don\u2019t go there. I think when players do that, that\u2019s more of someone, a producer or someone in their ear trying to rile them up to go try to get them to attack people. At the end of the day, we are about clicks and getting people to watch and ratings ...Yeah. It\u2019s a media ...It\u2019s a media deal. I try not to do that because I have relationships in the NFL that I hold in high regard and are dear to me. So the players that I do know, or like the Rams for example, I\u2019m always on the bus with them, I always talk to them. If there\u2019s a time where I need to be critical, I\u2019ll be critical, but it won\u2019t be like, \u201cThis guy is bad, oh this guy needs to make a play.\u201d Yeah. It\u2019s very simple, you could reword it. I think some guys, they just go out there and attack guys. For example, with the whole Le\u2019Veon Bell situation ...Sure. There were some people that were like, \u201cOh he\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s this, he\u2019s that.\u201d And just for people who maybe aren\u2019t familiar, he has a contract, but he\u2019s holding out. Well that\u2019s the paternal \u2014 He\u2019s on the franchise tag, which unless you sign it, you have a contract. If you don\u2019t sign it, you don\u2019t have a contract. Correct. So right now he just doesn\u2019t have a contract. The Steelers have his rights, so if he does decide to come back or when he decides to come back, he has to play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. But he doesn\u2019t have a contract, so he\u2019s not holding out, he\u2019s just not working right now. Got it. So some players were calling him selfish and saying different things. And my response to that is, you know, Le\u2019Veon Bell has been one of the top running backs in this league for the last four or five years, consistently. Yes he\u2019s had some off-the-field issues, and young players, when you get money in your pockets, most do. But they need to compensate him a certain way, they need to pay him for his worth and what he\u2019s been able to do. And for players to go out and speak on that, that\u2019s selfish on their part because Le\u2019Veon was all for you when it\u2019s your turn to get paid, right, and those type of things. Some former guys came out and were like, \u201cOh if I was in the locker room, I would do this.\u201d And I know them dudes, you wouldn\u2019t do any of that, right? So stop trying to make yourself bigger than what it is. Just be honest. I think honesty is the key in the media. At the end of the day, if you\u2019re honest and don\u2019t try to fabricate and try to make, \u201cOh I would have said this in the locker room,\u201d like no, you wouldn\u2019t have. You\u2019re talking about a guy and his money and his family, you\u2019re not ever going to cross that line, period, if he\u2019s there or he\u2019s not there. I think that was one of the big issues that you see in the media. Some players, they may think a certain way, but in all actuality they wouldn\u2019t do that in real life, right? They\u2019re just saying what they think because they\u2019re so far away from it. Do players ever come up to you if you do say something critical? Are they listening?Oh, yeah. They go back and listen to the broadcast or something?Yeah. So Le\u2019Veon and I have the same agent and there was a time where I said, you know, he needs to pick his game up a little bit. And I got a text ...You got a phone call from ...I got a text and a phone call and I explained to him, you know, look, that\u2019s my point of view. I\u2019m looking outside-in. You know what\u2019s going on inside the building, I don\u2019t. Yeah. But I wasn\u2019t too critical, I was like hey, he needs to do certain things, he needs to just do this and that. And I get it because I played and you don\u2019t want people to tell you what you\u2019re supposed to do. But I explained to him, look, I have a job to do and I always have what you\u2019re doing in your best interest, I\u2019m always in your best interest. I still have to do my job, right? Right. And if I see a play where I think you messed up, I\u2019m going to say it, period. Yeah. I\u2019m curious, given how not only your current role but how long you\u2019ve been following the media industry, what do you think of, where are we headed right now with the NFL and television? I think it was last year or two years ago, the ratings were down and it was like oh, is it Trump or ... Don\u2019t believe it. Well this year, they\u2019re back up, right? Yeah, yeah. Don\u2019t believe in none of that. When you\u2019re the big dog and your business is worth close to 11, 12 billion dollars, whatever it is, and everyone\u2019s trying to catch you, everyone\u2019s going to do everything, right? Sure. Now, granted, the ratings were down and normally they\u2019re down every year during an election year. Right. This was a big one because it was Trump and all that stuff. Yeah. It was Trump and Hillary and it was a lot of stuff going on, yeah, so that happens. But the money never changed. And that\u2019s what people have to realize, the ratings can go down, but as long as the money is going up that\u2019s all that matters. I think obviously with Colin Kaepernick and his situation and taking a knee and all that, America split. Some people aren\u2019t watching because Colin\u2019s still not playing. Some people aren\u2019t watching because players are taking a knee. At the end of the day, stadiums are still being sold out. TV, the most-watched games are NFL on TV, period, right? Yeah.I\u2019m a big \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d person, love it. They still have more people watch Sunday night games and Thursday night games when there\u2019s a great matchup than they do anything else. And football will always be that way. It\u2019s America\u2019s pastime. It\u2019s America\u2019s game. And I think once people get out their feelings and quit taking stuff personal and just quit being emotional and understand the message from both sides \u2014 specifically, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s message that people aren\u2019t being treated fairly in this country and that needs to change \u2014 I think football will go back to being great and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. What do you think about the kneeling thing? Do you have any strong opinion one way or the other? I protested when I played, over the same thing. We were in Green Bay, I was in Oakland, I scored and I did the hands up don\u2019t shoot. And at the time, I was raising three black boys, where I\u2019m going to have to tell them how to act when you get pulled over, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay. The same conversation my grandfather had with my mother and my uncles, that my mother and uncles had with me, I\u2019m going to have to have with my boys. That\u2019s four generations of teaching people how to act when you get pulled over. A lot of people don\u2019t have to do that. And so I\u2019ve definitely spoken about that a ton when I was playing and I still do now, about how I have to raise my kids, regardless of where I live, right? Regardless of how much money I make, and we\u2019ve seen that with Lebron, you still have to act a certain way because of the way I look. And I think that\u2019s wrong. And obviously Trump has come out and said some things and done some things and people have reacted to it, but at the end of the day, innocent people are dying every day from people who are supposed to protect and serve us, and that\u2019s not okay. We\u2019re not saying that every person is wrong and we\u2019re not saying that every police officer is bad, because they\u2019re not. My brother-in-law is a cop and he\u2019s a good one. I know a bunch of cops are on my ... I coach youth football, I have two cops on my coaching staff, they\u2019re good cops. But there\u2019s the few bad apples in those situations that make it bad for everybody. Yeah. And so those are the things that Colin Kaepernick and everyone that\u2019s fighting this, this social injustice, are trying to fix. Like change, reform these things and make it different. And when you try to change a structure of a country that\u2019s been running a certain way for a long time, you\u2019re going to get a ton of backlash. And that was understood. It feels new, even though to your point, you were doing something similar when you were a player, different way of expressing it, but the same idea. I guess I\u2019m curious, you mentioned how this can impact maybe people watching football or not watching football, do you see this as the kind of thing that we\u2019re going to still be talking about in a couple years or is this going to be the norm?I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the norm. I think again it\u2019s kind of changed a little bit, the narrative, because players were kneeling in the beginning \u2014 well, Colin was kneeling in the beginning \u2014 because he wanted to change some things. And those things are starting to happen, don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re starting to happen. But now, players are kneeling because he\u2019s not allowed to play the game anymore. He feels as if teams have \u2014 which I feel a certain way about it as well \u2014 but I feel like he\u2019s better than a lot of quarterbacks that are starting right now in the NFL and he should be in there. But these owners and teams have a right to pick who they want to do, and he has a right to go after the league for that. I think that\u2019s what the kneeling is about now. You still have players going out, going on police rides, trying to get the police and community to get back together. Those are important things that ... This is why it all started. Had nothing to do with the national anthem. Yeah.Had nothing to do with the veterans. Granted, that\u2019s the narrative that people spin to, but Colin made it really clear in the very beginning, and rightfully so. At the end of the day, people just want to be able to live their life not with fear. And right now, we\u2019re working towards that goal, but we still have a long ways to go. Yeah. What\u2019d you think of the Nike campaign?I love the Nike campaign. I thought it was awesome. I feel like it showed that he is different and it\u2019s okay to be different. It\u2019s so funny. It\u2019s easy for someone that\u2019s not in your shoes to say, \u201cI would do that,\u201d or, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d right? Sure.But unless you\u2019re in that position, you really don\u2019t know what you would do. I feel it\u2019s wrong for a lot of people to criticize players for not standing behind Colin Kaepernick, because they have families that they have to feed and that\u2019s where they make money. It is what it is. Colin knew going into it that this was a possibility and he still did that, and I applaud him for that. Yeah. For Nike to jump on and stay with him throughout this whole process, who\u2019s one of the bigger sponsors of the NFL, it\u2019s huge to show that you know what, at the end of the day, we are going to be on the right side of history. I think that\u2019s a statement that, for a company like Nike to step up, shows other companies that you can do it, which other companies have tried to follow off as well. I want to get your opinion about futuristic technologies. Where do you think we\u2019re going to be watching a football game in five years? Is it still going to be traditional TV?It\u2019s starting to change now where you\u2019re watching on your phones and stuff, which is awesome, because everyone\u2019s on the go. It\u2019s weird the way things are starting to change. It\u2019s a different dynamic now where Sundays used to be the day that you and your family would hang out and watch games together and do the family deal, where now most people are on the go, trying to go somewhere, are always on their phones, so you get a chance to consume it that way. There\u2019s also a lot of football, and I\u2019m a big football fan, but by Sunday evening ...You\u2019re drained, yo. I could be very well drained from football, especially I also like college football, so it\u2019s ...You\u2019re getting everything. Add another day of the week in there. I had an opportunity to, a couple years ago when I first retired, to invest in a VR company. What\u2019s it called?It was called RAD3. Okay. \u201cIt was called.\u201d Does that mean it\u2019s not around?I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still called that or not. Yeah, got it. I know VR\u2019s where they\u2019re still in. I know they have a VR arcade in Walnut Creek, so if you wanted to go check it out, it\u2019s pretty dope. Check it out, okay. Myself and a high school teammate of mine who played for the Patriots started a game with them called Dime Time, and it was a game to teach young kids how to play quarterback, without playing quarterback. Sure. So, teaching you how to go through your reads and teaching you different concepts and teaching you what coverages look like, by animation. It was like a video game. I could see the game going that way. I could see the whole ... They can experience ... that commercial they had where you put the thing on and you do what Michael ... I could see those things happening.But at the end of the day, it\u2019ll be hard to consume it being in the game because the game is so fast. It\u2019ll be crazy for people. Some people get nauseous from it. Some people just wouldn\u2019t understand it. You always need that bird\u2019s-eye view, and I think the television companies were doing a great job with that and then the production of it, so I think iPhones or Samsungs or whatever mobile device you have will be the way that people will ...You\u2019ll still have TVs. You\u2019ll still have Apple TV, all those different things, but I still think cable and DirecTV will still be around. Yeah.I have people telling me like, \u201cIn three years, DirecTV will never be around.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cMm, I don\u2019t think so, bro.\u201dI get a lot of young people don\u2019t pay for cable and they use Amazon Prime or whatever it may be, but the avid football fan wants more, and you\u2019re going to get that from watching TV and watching different things or on your phone and doing those type of deals. I think it may lean more towards the mobile devices, but it\u2019ll still be a lot of TV being watched. I think the thing with VR, for me, and I\u2019ve seen the different angles at which you can watch a game and look around, feels like you\u2019re in the stands, whatever. I think the big thing, for me, is that I still consider watching sports a pretty social element of my life. I usually am with a friend or ...Sports bar. Yeah, sports bar with my wife and with whatever, so unless I\u2019m home alone, I\u2019m not probably going to throw on a VR headset. And even then, it\u2019s got to be a better experience than TV, which is pretty good. That\u2019s the thing that the NFL is having trouble with right now is that the TV experience is much better than in-game.It is, and in-game\u2019s expensive too. It\u2019s expensive. They\u2019re trying to find ways to make it a little bit more fan-friendly. What does that mean? Is there a risk of ... We see with the LA Chargers, for example. They can barely sell out this small soccer stadium. Are people not going to go to games?Yeah, but they have their own issues, why they\u2019re not selling out. True. For sure. It has nothing to do with \u2026 Them leaving San Diego is the main reason. A lot of people were upset with that.Sure. And they\u2019ve been upset with the way their team has been run for years, right? That\u2019s a bad example. That takes that one. But I could say, for example, when the Rams moved here... When the Rams moved here, it was weird. The first game was sold out. It was crazy because it was LA, they\u2019re back, and they weren\u2019t good. Are they playing in the Rose Bowl or at USC?They\u2019re playing at USC, the Coliseum. Okay. Which is big, the Coliseum. Yeah, it\u2019s a 98,000. It was sold out. Yeah, that\u2019s a lot of fans. But they weren\u2019t good. Yes. It was like, \u201cugh,\u201d you know what I mean? You have to be good consistently to get people to come and watch. That\u2019s the key. And in the league right now, you have like four or five teams that are really good, maybe eight that are really good, and the rest are either mediocre to bad. Teams are always rebuilding, always changing. There\u2019s no real consistency, and that\u2019s what hurts you more than anything. Everyone\u2019s trying to find the next Sean McVay or the next Sean Payton. The next Bill Belichick. Everyone\u2019s trying to find this guy, but you have to give your guys an opportunity. The thing about Bill Belichick is he\u2019s been coaching the Patriots for 19 years or something crazy like that. Consistency, that\u2019s the key. A lot of people are impatient, and a lot of fan bases are impatient. They want to win, so if you don\u2019t win right away, that hurts ticket sales and it makes it easier for them to go and watch you on TV. Do you have any opinion about tech companies, like Amazon for example, or Facebook or Twitter, coming in and streaming a game versus a traditional TV network? No. Why not? I\u2019m all for trying to get it out to as many people as possible. I remember doing a Yahoo ... The Jags played the Ravens last year in London. In London, yeah. We did the pre and post from here, but Yahoo streamed it. And I want to say it hit like 6.5 million people. That\u2019s huge. At 6 AM on the West Coast, right?Right. 9 AM on the East Coast, you have a game that you can see on your phone if it wasn\u2019t blacked out in your area. That\u2019s big. You\u2019re just trying to reach more and more people, and these people were global. It wasn\u2019t DirecTV. It wasn\u2019t your cable, whatever cable box you have. It was people across the world watching this game. I think the more the league can do that, the more fans they\u2019ll draw in, and it\u2019ll be better for this business. Yeah. It seems to be moving that way, for sure. I\u2019m interested to see if it\u2019ll survive on like a Netflix or Amazon Prime subscription, right?Right. That is something that we haven\u2019t really seen, beyond just experiments at this point. It feels like we\u2019re headed that direction, at least for maybe a handful of games. I\u2019ll tell you this, the one thing I learned about the NFL: Money talks. Yeah. No matter what, they\u2019ll find a way to make it work. Yes, they\u2019re testing games and doing things because there\u2019s always a bigger picture behind it. That\u2019s big business. That\u2019s the business of Facebook. That\u2019s why Facebook is buying everything. They\u2019re buying the Oculus, and they\u2019re buying Instagram, and they\u2019re buying this, and Google\u2019s buying that. And Google has their own venture firm that\u2019s investing. Everyone\u2019s trying to buy and get as much content as possible, but the No. 1 content in the world ... well, in the world it\u2019s soccer, but in America it\u2019s football. Everyone\u2019s trying to figure out a way to get that content because that\u2019s what drives, obviously, viewers and subscribers and things like that. And live sports is one of the only things that still gets people to the couch at a specific time. Probably the only thing, right? Maybe politics?Politics, I think ... It\u2019s weird, because when you bring in politics, mostly you\u2019re with people that think the way you think. Sure. Otherwise it\u2019s a very uncomfortable viewing experience. Yeah, it\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never seen people say, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m going to go watch with Democrats.\u201d No. It\u2019s never that. Yeah, no. It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go hang out with my buddies that think the same way I do.\u201d Which is your prerogative. I\u2019ve always been taught ... At De La Salle [High School], they had a debate team, and I did a little bit of it. I always want to know what the other side\u2019s thinking, because you just never know. Like, my argument may be flawed. I don\u2019t know. If I don\u2019t know what the other side\u2019s thinking ... So, I actually do try to hang out with people who think differently than me just to hear their arguments, because if we do end up getting into it, I want to know what you\u2019re thinking or I want to make sure that I\u2019m right in my thinking. But politics ...You should run. Are you going to run for office? Look, someone who actually wants to hear both sides, that\u2019s like you\u2019re a unicorn out there in the world of politics. You should always hear both sides. I think sometimes we lose our reason and we kind of let it be emotional. Sports is probably the only thing you can do when we watch with everyone. My brother-in-law is a Bengals fan, and this past weekend they played the Dolphins. And one of his best friends is a Dolphins fan, so him and his buddy, who are both Bengals fans, go to this Dolphins bar in Atlanta and they\u2019re watching it. He said it was the best time ever.Yeah?He was like, they were yelling at them when the game was going, and then he was yelling at them at the end because they won. But it was all in good spirit. Sure. I think that\u2019s what makes football, because everyone understands sports and they try to keep it lively. It can be a fine line sometimes. You mentioned investing. You said you invested in a VR company. Mm-hmm.And you live in the Bay Area right now. Yeah. I\u2019m surrounded by tech. You\u2019re surrounded by tech. What\u2019s your status as an investor? Is it something you actively do?It\u2019s tough because I have so many kids. I have three kids now, so I try not to lose a lot of money because they take a lot of it with youth sports, which I\u2019m really big into that as well.There\u2019s been opportunities that I\u2019ve ... like you buy stock in Facebook when they come out, or different platforms like that, Twitter and different things. There\u2019s actually a group led by Ryan Nece, who is Ronnie Lott\u2019s son, I forget the name of it. It\u2019s ...An investment group, though?It\u2019s an investment group, yes. Okay. With this group, we\u2019ve been working together trying to figure out a way to work together and do some investing. But he\u2019s so connected and into tech. I got a chance to go to Google Ventures. Got a chance to go to Sand Hill, we were talking about before. Yeah, Sand Hill Road. The Rosewood Hotel. Rosewood Hotel. What is the big VC up there on Sand Hill Road? It\u2019s a couple of them, but ...There\u2019s a bunch of them. Sequoia?Sequoia!Okay. Went to Sequoia. Met with them. They were talking about some things where ...And my concern with the investing is that it\u2019s such a low hit rate that it scares me. I\u2019m real soft when it comes to that. You don\u2019t like the risk. I grew up with no money, so it\u2019s like: I got money, I\u2019m gonna try to keep it as long as I can. But they were talking about how they try to hit it like a 20 percent, 30 percent rate. If they hit, then they\u2019re happy. And they\u2019re like the best in the biz, historically. Exactly. They told us a story about how they spent one-point-something billion dollars, and they invested in this molecule that ends up selling and that one molecule paid for the whole thing three times over, right?Sure. It\u2019s a real dangerous game, and it\u2019s kind of hard, especially now with everyone popping up with something. Snapchat is tough. My brother works at Snapchat. Oh, really?Yeah. He\u2019s out here in LA, so he always talks about it. But it\u2019s always something new coming up. You just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to hit or not, so that\u2019s always the scary part. Like Uber, Lyft ...How do players deal with that while they\u2019re still playing? I imagine they get tons of people throwing things at them. You always hear, \u201cSo-and-so lost their money. They invested in a bunch of car washes,\u201d or \u201cThey invested in restaurants,\u201d or whatever. What was it like as a player to have that happen?It was crazy. You always get hit with different things, but I had two great men that were surrounding me, my financial guy, who works for UBS, Stacy Oster. Great guy, really scrubs everything, real conservative, making sure everything\u2019s good. Takes his time with it, too. Doesn\u2019t rush it. A lot of times people be like, \u201cI need it by tomorrow.\u201d Like, we\u2019re not going to get that, so chill out. Sure. Then, obviously, my agent, Adisa Bakari, who\u2019s at the Sports Entertainment Group, was another one that I would like to run stuff by because he\u2019s a lawyer. He would run it through his investment lawyers to make sure everything was good, do background checks, make sure that people were clean. And a lot of times, you do a background check, the person\u2019s dirty that you\u2019re dealing with so you usually get away from it. A couple of times, it ended up working out where it was a good investment. There were some times it was a good investment, we just took too long and we missed it. For me, my biggest investment when I was playing ball was in me. Sure. Your next contract. If I was healthy and I was doing things, I got endorsements, my next contract, so that\u2019s what I was investing in more than anything else. A lot of players are so funny. My grandpa always used to always tell me, \u201cDude, you\u2019re a football player. You\u2019re not an engineer. You\u2019re not an investor. You\u2019re none of this. Your whole life, you\u2019ve played football. You went to college, let\u2019s be honest, you went to UCLA, got a good education, but you went to play football, so be a football player.\u201dMy agent used to say the same thing. Sometimes players come out and they feel like, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do this,\u201d but you never put in the amount of time and effort to do it. That\u2019s why, like I told you in the very beginning of the show, I sucked as a broadcaster at the very beginning. Horrible. But I put those 10,000 hours in of watching tape, watching myself, making sure I\u2019m critical of myself, being coached by different people, doing improv classes, different things to help me become a better person, to find my niche in what I want to do within the media. I think a lot of players need to understand that when they start investing is like, all right, dude. You have money, that\u2019s great, but don\u2019t be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go open up a car wash.\u201d You\u2019ve never washed a car in your life! Right. What do you know about a car wash? What do you know about running something? Even now, like I opened a gym in the Bay Area, or a facility. It\u2019s crazy, so many things have popped up in the last ... We opened it a year ago. I funded everything, and all my buddies come in and they train out of there. Great business. We went from 15 people to almost 600 in a year. Like members to the gym?Yeah. It\u2019s not necessarily a membership gym. It\u2019s more of people that come through. Gotcha. How we have it is like a salon. It\u2019s made up like a salon because I\u2019m not there every day. Okay. I had to do it where they\u2019re independent contractors. We work ourselves throughout. But we created a baseball organization out of the facility. We created a basketball organization out of facility. We\u2019re creating a track one out of the facility where we\u2019re branching off to do different things. It\u2019s crazy. The heads that come with it and the stuff that comes with it and things that break. I\u2019m like, what am I doing? But, at the end of the day, it was my love for my community to help our kids have a place that they can train and be better. I trained in Miami. I trained in LA. I trained in all these different cities. There was nothing in the Bay Area, or the East Bay at least, that I can say, \u201cThis is where I trained.\u201d Yeah. So we created this space for young athletes as well as adults to come and work out. And we\u2019ve grown. We\u2019ve done a great job with it. You always hear about, especially the players on the Warriors, oh they live in Silicon Valley and they have ownership group in the NBA who\u2019s very connected to the Silicon Valley tech scene, so they\u2019re cropping up investing. You finished your career, most of your career was in Jacksonville, but you finished your career in Oakland. You\u2019re from Oakland originally.Yeah.Does playing in the Bay Area, is there a benefit to players actually playing out there and being close to all of this?Yeah, if you\u2019re good. Yeah?I think if you\u2019re a good team, yeah, no question. For me, going back home was more I just wanted to play in front of my family again. Growing up in the Bay Area, playing youth football in Antioch, to going to De La Salle, to going to UCLA and coming back and playing Stanford and playing Cal there and having that go. It\u2019s just such a special place when you\u2019re able to go back home and play, and you play well. In Jacksonville, we had a couple times we came out to the Bay Area. I think I came out two or three times, it wasn\u2019t anything fun. To be able to wear the black and silver in front of my family members who were all Raiders fans for the most part \u2014 my wife\u2019s family\u2019s a Niners fan but, ehh ...Yeah. It\u2019s all good.You can stare them down at Thanksgiving. They were Raider fans when I played.What about, sorry, but what about ...That\u2019s what I was gonna tell you. That, when you, when you\u2019re able to do those, you create relationships, right? So, the kids that I went to high school with may now work at such and such tech or may do this. It opens doors. Just like going to New York. If you played in New York, if you look at Michael Strahan, if Michael Strahan played for the Houston Texans he wouldn\u2019t be Michael Strahan who he is today.Sure.Because of that market that New York provides. Well, the Bay Area is a little bit different where you get an opportunity to see tech every day. You talk about the Warriors\u2019 owners, those are tech guys. They are able to open doors for you and different ventures that you may be able to ... if that interests you. I remember at the Raiders, we would have dinners or lunches, their player development guy would set up, I think his name is LaMonte, LaMonte Winston. LaMonte would set up dinners with CEOs and VCs and all these people and you\u2019d meet them and you\u2019d hang out and you\u2019d talk and you\u2019d be able to pass cards and email and do all those things. Still today, there are still people that I met at that that I keep in contact with, if its either through a fantasy league that we\u2019re in or through whatever else it may be. Where I live now, in the city I live in now, my neighbors are all VC people, so again, it\u2019s definitely a plus living in the Bay Area. Now, it\u2019s expensive, don\u2019t get my wrong, but the opportunity there is tremendous. There\u2019s people that either I coached their kid in youth football or they\u2019re my neighbor and there\u2019s different opportunities that were presented to you because of how you carry yourself or because people want to have you around. Yeah. So you came out to the League, I believe, in 2006?Yes.Social media didn\u2019t really exist in 2006. No, it didn\u2019t. Good thing, right? Now, obviously, hard to imagine life without it. What was it like as player to basically come into the League with no social media and by the time you left what, nine seasons later, it was probably all anyone talked about? Well, I\u2019ll say this much. UCLA was the third school with Facebook, I wanna say? Second or third.Sure. We were one of the first schools with Facebook and so, it was weird being able to have a site. It was kind of like Myspace in a way, right? Everyone had a Myspace or things like that. But to have Facebook, that was only for college kids in the very beginning, which was amazing right? So you remember signing up? Oh, no, no question. Signed up and was poking everybody and friending all my friends and all the stuff you\u2019re supposed to do. But that was more like, intimate. It was more just for college kids. Now, when Facebook opened up to everybody, I was a little upset about it because I felt like that took away the special interaction that I had with people that were in college. When I got to the pros, I turned off my Facebook at that point. Just because you were too busy or because people were harassing you on it or? Nah, it just didn\u2019t seem authentic to me anymore after that, ya know? It was for college kids and it should\u2019ve been for college kids. Now, granted, at that point I was 20 years old. I didn\u2019t understand the financial benefits of opening it up to everyone, which now I do and I see why they did it. But, at that point, it was just for me, personally. It was just like, \u201cAh well, it was fun for college, I\u2019m in the pros now, let me leave it alone.\u201d Which was not very smart. Why is that? Well, \u2018cause I probably would\u2019ve had a bigger following if I would\u2019ve kept it. Sure. Once you delete it, you have to start it back up again and do all those different things. And as a football player, especially now, you get a lot of endorsements and things because of the followers you have. The reason Odell Beckham got a $25 million Nike shoe deal was because he has like 17 million people that follow him or something crazy, right? Sure. Your reach is much greater than, obviously, what mine was. It\u2019s funny. Rashad Jennings was a guy who, we were in Miami training, I want to say, might\u2019ve been 2008 or 2009.He\u2019s a teammate of yours? A teammate of mine who now is doing acting in Hollywood. He came to me and was like, \u201cHey man, you need to try this Twitter thing.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything with social media. I\u2019m done. I just want to play football. I wanna train, play football, have fun, chill.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cMan, listen, go get you a Twitter. Trust me. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d So I got it, started watching, kind of seeing/following people. I\u2019ve always been interested in news and I used to read the newspaper all the time. That\u2019s why he brought it to me. He was like, \u201cBro, this is like the newspaper, just on your phone.\u201d Eventually I started tweeting these couple things out, you started getting responses and you started seeing people from different places. I fell in love with Twitter. You were managing your own Twitter account? I manage all my own stuff. Gotcha. I don\u2019t do the whole publicist ...A lot of athletes or famous people have agents ...To me, that\u2019s trash. If you\u2019re gonna do it, do it. If you\u2019re not gonna do it, don\u2019t do it. It should be authentic if you\u2019re gonna go out there. People know who I am. I\u2019m always going to be me, I\u2019m never going to be anyone else. I can\u2019t have anyone be me. I have my own little corny jokes, or dry sense of humor that I throw out there; dad jokes or whatever it may be that people know it\u2019s me. At least the people that know me know it\u2019s me. And so, it\u2019s funny, Twitter, I was ... 2010, I had hurt my knee. I\u2019m out for the year and I\u2019m watching the Chicago Bears game. The NFC Championship game against the Packers and I tweet something out about Jay Cutler, saying, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, quit.\u201dQuarterback for the Bears.Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jay Cutler, quarterback for the Bears. And so, there were a lot of Bears fans that weren\u2019t really happy with that. Actually, it was a two-piece joke because it was like, \u201cthe Urban Meyer rule is in full effect.\u201d And then \u201c... when the going gets tough, quit.\u201d Because he just did that in Florida. So a lot of Florida fans were upset with me; a lot of Bears fans were upset with me. It was all over the media. Everyone took it. That\u2019s when I realized how powerful social media was. At that point I think I had 20,000 followers, the next morning I woke up with 500,000. Wow. That was your moment of viral social media. It was real. And it was one of the first things that ever happened. I then realized, okay, I have to be careful what I say on here, because not only are other people watching, there\u2019s kids following, there\u2019s different things. Even though I knew what I said wasn\u2019t wrong, it was true, but... You\u2019re still active on Twitter.Oh, always active on Twitter. I answer fantasy questions. I tweet at people sometimes. I always try to tweet out. I\u2019m big into the high school recruiting scene, so I always retweet the kids that I train with or work with, helping them get recruits. I deal with a lot of coaches in that situation. I always tweet out certain news sites or whatever it may be that I feel like is more on my side of thinking, obviously. Every now and then I\u2019ll tweet out the other side of thinking. I enjoy it because it gives you a platform to really express who you are. Now, there\u2019s some times I may not use Twitter for a month, then I\u2019ll just pop up. I may not use Instagram for a month, then I\u2019ll just pop up. Is that the other site you use? Your brother\u2019s at Snap. I have a Snapchat but I\u2019m more of a looker than a Snapchat... That\u2019s too much. I\u2019m not that young. How do you deal with trolls? I\u2019m sure you have, as a famous person, I\u2019m sure people like to call you out for things or whatever. I\u2019m okay with the trolls. It\u2019s the death threats that you get a little upset with. I\u2019m sure. I could see that. Right. Again, those are people ... I grew up in a rougher area, it doesn\u2019t really bother me, the trolling. People are going to talk bad about you, that\u2019s what some people do to make them feel better. But after the Chicago Bears situation, I had a couple death threats and I wasn\u2019t too happy about it, to say the least. Yeah, I can imagine.But lot of that is people ... No one is going to really ...Yeah. Most people are just talking. They\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019ll do this to you when I see you.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell then, pull up. This is where I\u2019ll be.\u201d Or, another great example, I was with the Jags and a bunch of Raiders fans were like on my timeline talking crazy. That Super Bowl, I forgot where we were, but I was like, \u201cThis is where I am. I live in the Bay Area in the off season. This is the bar I go to every time. If you\u2019re feeling froggy, just show up, I\u2019ll be there on Tuesdays, just catch me there.\u201d And again, you do it to quiet people down. Did you ever get scared someone might actually show up?No, no one\u2019s gonna show up. Ain\u2019t no one that bold in this day. People just talk.Yeah. Well, you\u2019re also quite large. I handle my own. Right? You would be fine. Again, those are people expressing themselves. And that\u2019s what we have to see it as. And so like after seeing it from the other side, I get it. People are passionate about their teams and their fan bases and so you always want to let them express themselves. As a father of three, how do you think about social or tech for your kids? When I told you I had three boys, one of them was my nephew. He\u2019s moved out and lives with his mom now.Gotcha. My cousin. So you have ...?Two boys and a girl.Gotcha. They all have Snapchat. How old are they? 10, 8 and 7. Okay.But again, you just have to educate them on it. And that\u2019s what I try to do. I\u2019ve never been a parent to try and shield my kids from the world, because those kids end up doing bad things when they\u2019re hit with adversity. I\u2019ve always tried to be honest with my kids about questions they\u2019ve asked. I\u2019ve always tried to, you know, teach them how life is. My kids are pretty different. They watch the news.Oh, wow. Like Fox News and CNN News. It\u2019s so funny.Like the real news.Like the real news. They\u2019ll be up late at night watching certain channels. I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, turn it off.\u201dWow. \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d \u201cYeah, turn it off.\u201d So, they\u2019re engaged. 2016, they were really big into politics. They had their own voice. Not my voice, their own voice, and we would speak on it. That\u2019s how my family is. We can sit down and disagree over certain things and still be able to break bread and enjoy each other\u2019s company. That\u2019s just how we are. I\u2019ve always wanted to raise my kids to be able to think for themselves and not push my views on them because my views are my views. My wife\u2019s views are her views. Their views are their views. They should be able to hold an intellectual conversation with anyone at the age of 10 on anything. Yeah. So you don\u2019t mind if they have a Twitter or ...They don\u2019t have Twitter. They only have Snapchat.Snapchat. Little bit more intimate, that way. Yeah. And the more of it, you can kind of watch who\u2019s following \u2018em and those type of things. What do you feel about ... I know you said you\u2019re big into youth sports, what do you think about the obvious, tackle football for kids? I love it. Yeah? Not worried about it?I think it\u2019s the best thing going. Not at all. Why not? Because you can get hurt doing anything. And I\u2019ll give you a great example. This year, I coached 10U [youth football]. It cracks me up. One of our players got hurt. Broke his foot and sprained his ankle. You would think it\u2019s at practice. No. It was jumping on a trampoline. Another kid got a concussion. You think it was at practice? No, he was riding a scooter without a helmet. Yeah. If you\u2019re gonna stop players from playing football, then don\u2019t let them play at recess because a couple years ago my son had a team that had five kids get hurt. None got hurt on the football field. One got hurt playing tag at recess, ran into a pole. Another broke his arm skateboarding. The stuff that kids do. So how many concussions do kids get when they fall off something? Off a bike or they could fall off the swing set. We don\u2019t quantify those. I think, for me, this is my analogy I tell people. When, let\u2019s say you wanna have heart surgery. Do you want the guy fresh out of med school doing it? Or do you want the 20-year pro doing it? Everyone chooses the 20-year pro and that\u2019s what it is for football. Yes, it is a very dangerous sport but if you have a kid that is playing at the age of 5 or 6; both my boys played at 5 and 6. The hits aren\u2019t that hard. They are learning how to protect themselves. And if they do make a mistake, there\u2019s no real risk at that given point. Because they\u2019re not being hit hard enough.Yeah, because you\u2019re talking about kids who aren\u2019t coordinated. You\u2019re talking about the pads being bigger than them the majority of the time. It\u2019s like little bodies, big heads.Right.But they\u2019re learning that, when I go across the middle, okay, this may hurt. Ah! Okay, I know how to protect myself. Then, instead of putting a kid at 12, who will then play against someone who has been playing for six years and their first year is at 12? You\u2019re guaranteed that 12-year-old is going to get hurt. And then, let\u2019s wait till high school? You\u2019re guaranteed that 14-year-old is going to get hurt. Guess what? Now kids are lifting weights. They\u2019re bigger, stronger, more coordinated, and your kid doesn\u2019t know how to protect himself, where these other guys do. And then you get hurt.I always tell people, when they come and they ask me for my opinion, I always say play early. Play as early as you can. And flag is not football. Right? And don\u2019t get me wrong. I think it\u2019s a great sport and I think a lot of people do it. It\u2019s a kind of a side dish to tackle. But the flag rules are completely different than the tackle rules and the reason being is that you have to be a much more physical person. And I have a lot of kids who have played flag for two or three, four years and now they\u2019re coming to tackle football and, at the age of 10, it\u2019s a big jump because they\u2019ve never seen contact like that. The thought of, you have to run as fast as you can into the other person to protect yourself, they don\u2019t understand it. And I always tell them, if you go 50 percent and he goes 100, you\u2019re gonna get hurt. It\u2019s been a great teaching point. A lot of parents have bought into what we\u2019re doing at our organization and we\u2019re going to try to continue to grow this thing because the game of football is special. I always tell people, I\u2019m from a small town called Antioch, California. We\u2019ve had five guys go pro out of this town. Or six. Maybe more, actually. Myself, Sterling Moore, Taiwan Jones, Jeremy Newberry, Anthony Trucks, TJ Ward, Terron Ward are the ones that I know about. There are probably more, but football allowed us to leave this small town in the Bay Area, East Bay. We\u2019re the first city in the Bay Area, the delta where all that stuff is, to go see London, to go to New York City, to travel the world and do different things. Take care of our family, set up our families forever. Who am I to not allow my kids or anyone else\u2019s kids that right to be able try and get that and get what football has done for me?I always tell people, it\u2019s better off starting early than it is starting late.That seems like as good a spot as any to stop. All right. But this was awesome. MJD, thank you so much for your time.No problem. Next time, see you in the Bay Area. Let\u2019s do it up north. All right.
