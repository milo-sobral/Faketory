{"id": "Hillary Clinton is pretty critical of Facebook, including its executives", "paragraph": "Hillary Clinton took some fairly strong shots at Facebook and its chief executives on Friday, telling Recode that social giants like Facebook would \u201chave to be held accountable\u201d with regulation after the 2016 election.The former Democratic presidential candidate was disadvantaged by the influence campaign plotted by the Russians that played out on Facebook, and Clinton said she felt Facebook was overwhelmed by it. Clinton\u2019s comments were notable in part because she weighed in on some of the executives who are responsible, such as Sheryl Sandberg, who is a close friend of hers.\u201cI think that the companies themselves are going to have to be held accountable,\u201d Clinton told interviewer Kara Swisher during a live taping of Recode Decode at New York City\u2019s 92nd Street YMCA on Friday evening, ticking through some efforts to further regulate companies like Facebook. \u201cThey would have to recognize that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now is far beyond anything Mark Zuckerberg thought about in his dorm at Harvard.\u201d\u201cWhen you have the military of Myanmar using Facebook to stoke genocide against the Rohingya, that is not something that is going to bring together and create community \u2014 just the opposite.\u201dYou can listen to the full interview in the embedded audio player below, or subscribe to Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Clinton said that adversaries of the U.S. \u201cjust exploited the heck out of Facebook.\u201dClinton obviously has a complaint to make: Facebook was slow to recognize the attempts to wage disinformation campaigns during the 2016 campaign, and the platform still continues to reckon with new attacks waged by new nations in the run-up to the 2018 midterms. Opinions vary on how much of a difference the Facebook ads by Russian-backed hackers made on the outcome of the 2016 race.Swisher asked Clinton if she had spoken with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg or Sandberg directly since the election \u2014 a question Clinton didn\u2019t answer. But any frustration with Sandberg would be a little awkward, given that Sandberg endorsed Clinton and is a longtime personal friend.\u201cI think they knew more during than the election than they admitted, but I think they didn\u2019t understand the full implication of it,\u201d Clinton said when asked about Facebook\u2019s top two leaders.In fact, Clinton took a shot at Zuckerberg right off the bat.\u201cEvery time Mark Zuckerberg talks to me, it ends in disaster and tears for Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d Swisher said, just as the pair sat down.\u201cI\u2019m not hiding anybody\u2019s data,\u201d Clinton joked, \u201cso I\u2019m in good shape.\u201dSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
