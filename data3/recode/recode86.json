{"id": "Facebook\u2019s board is throwing public support behind Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg \u2014 who are on Facebook\u2019s board", "paragraph": "Facebook is circling the wagons as the company looks to do damage control following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday that called into question decisions made by Facebook leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, over the past two years. Among the claims in the story: That Facebook knew Russia was using the service to try and influence the 2016 election much earlier than it publicly announced. The story also revealed that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to \u201cdiscredit activist protesters\u201d and link them to Democratic financier George Soros, something Zuckerberg claimed on Thursday that he knew nothing about. That story got us asking: Who from Facebook might be fired for the company\u2019s missteps?Whoever it is, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be Zuckerberg or Sandberg. At least not right now. Facebook\u2019s board of directors issued a public statement defending the company\u2019s efforts in fighting Russian election meddling efforts following the 2016 presidential election. It also called the story \u201cgrossly unfair.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement.\u201cAs Mark and Sheryl made clear to Congress, the company was too slow to spot Russian interference, and too slow to take action. As a board we did indeed push them to move faster. But to suggest that they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened is grossly unfair. In the last eighteen months Facebook, with the full support of this board, has invested heavily in more people and better technology to prevent misuse of its services, including during elections. As the U.S. mid-term showed, they have made considerable progress and we support their continued to efforts to fight abuse and improve security.\u201dThe irony, of course, is that Zuckerberg and Sandberg are both on Facebook\u2019s board. Given the statement isn\u2019t attributable to any one board member, it looks like Facebook\u2019s executives are throwing public support behind ... themselves. On a conference call with reporters that lasted well over an hour Thursday morning, Zuckerberg also sidestepped multiple questions asking him whether someone at Facebook should be fired for the company\u2019s strategic moves over the past few years. \u201cIn terms of performance and personnel management, I just generally don\u2019t talk about that \u2014 specific cases of that in public,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we run the company and people make mistakes and there\u2019s no consequences.\u201dZuckerberg also gave a strong showing of support for Sandberg, who came out looking the worst of all Facebook\u2019s executives from the New York Times investigation. Not only did Sandberg make some questionable decisions about when and how to disclose Russian meddling efforts, but a lot of the other executives mentioned making questionable decisions were Sandberg\u2019s direct reports. \u201cSheryl is doing great work for the company. She\u2019s been a very important partner to me, and continues to be, and will continue to be,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cShe\u2019s leading a lot of the efforts to improve our systems in these areas, and as I\u2019ve tried to convey, while these are big issues, I think we\u2019re making a lot of progress and a lot of that is because of the work that she\u2019s doing.\u201dIt does not look like Zuckerberg will be giving up his own role as CEO, or as Facebook\u2019s chairman, anytime soon. When asked about the chairman role, Zuckerberg said he didn\u2019t think changing his role on the board was \u201cthe right way to go.\u201d When asked why he was still the best person to run Facebook, Zuckerberg said that he has Facebook on the right path to improvement \u2014 he just needs more time. \u201cI don\u2019t think that me or anyone else could come in and snap our fingers and have these issues resolved in a quarter or half a year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stuff is painful ... but to some degree, you have to know that you\u2019re on the path and that you\u2019re doing the right things and then allow for some time for the teams to actually execute and get the stuff working the way that we all know it that it needs to be, and to the standard that people expect.\u201dSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...One senator says the company \"actually encouraged anti-Semitism\" by hiring an opposition-research firm.A Verge affiliate site"}
