{"id": "\u2018The Front Runner\u2019 director Jason Reitman says technology has taught today\u2019s young people how to be great filmmakers", "paragraph": "Jason Reitman\u2019s new movie \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d chronicles the sex scandal that ended Gary Hart\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign, which means it\u2019s set in 1987 \u2014 a year when Reitman was only 10 years old and not yet making movies.Back then, becoming a filmmaker was a goal with high barriers to entry. But if he were growing up today \u2014 and if his father weren\u2019t the director of beloved movies like \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u2014 Reitman thinks he might be one of the kids on YouTube, learning filmmaking technique accidentally.\u201cThe old way was, you play a concert the day you learn guitar, right?\u201d Reitman asked on the latest episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka. \u201cAnd your first time you ever play out, of course you don\u2019t know how to play guitar. You literally just picked up the instrument.\u201d\u201cThink about how young people [today] know their angles and the use of light, and the use of lens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see people take selfies, and they\u2019re raising the camera, because they understand what it does to their face. All these ideas of lensing and camera work are things that are just inherent to a generation.\u201dAn ardent fan of seeing movie theaters in his personal life Reitman, is one of the directors who has not yet made the leap to a digital platform like Amazon or Netflix. But he\u2019s no luddite, either; he told Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka that he was impressed by the editing style of YouTube videos, as well as professionally-made movies like Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cTangerine\u201d that can be shot entirely on an iPhone. And, he said, his attachment to the theater may just be because of when he grew up.\u201cI\u2019m sure if I was growing up right now, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it,\u201d Reitman said. \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, I watch everything on Netflix. Why would I care?\u2019\u201dYou can listen to Recode Media wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Peter\u2019s conversation with Jason.Peter Kafka: This is Recode Media with Peter Kafka. That is me. I\u2019m back. Thanks to everyone for your patience. I\u2019m gonna have more extended thank you\u2019s at the end of this podcast, but for now, to introduce you to Jason Reitman, who has not one, but two films out this year. One is called \u201cTully.\u201d It came out in the spring. The other one is called Front Runner, which should probably be out as you\u2019re listening to this. Welcome, Jason.Jason Reitman: Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming. You\u2019ve made some of my favorite movies, which is what I tell most of the directors that come on here\u2026 because it\u2019s true.Don\u2019t lie to me!Because I get to pick and choose. It\u2019s true.Don\u2019t butter me up.\u201cJuno.\u201dThank you.\u201cThanks For Smoking,\u201d \u201cYoung Adult.\u201dThank you.What am I missing? I\u2019m missing a whole bunch. \u201cUp in the Air?\u201d\u201cUp in the Air!\u201d That one makes me anxious, which is why I think it blocks it out.Why?\u2019Cause it\u2019s about losing your job, or one of the plot lines is about losing your job.It\u2019s interesting because we made that movie in the midst of a recession, but when I started writing it, we were in the midst of an economic boom. So when I wrote the movie, the idea that he fired people for a living was kind of ironic. And then by the time we were making it in 2010, and shooting-It was very real. ... Yeah, we were shooting in St. Louis, and we were shooting in Detroit. They were two cities that got really hit hard. Detroit, obviously. St. Louis, the Anheuser-Busch plant had closed and 10,000 jobs, or something like that, were gone. And, I remember my father came to me, \u2018cause he actually produced that movie, and he said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re capturing a moment. You have to treat this realistically.\u201d And that was the moment we decided, what if we cast all real people who had lost their jobs and put them in the movie?Right.And we put out an ad as though we were making a documentary about the recession and we brought in all these real people, and we interviewed them, and then took them through this roleplay where we kind of fired them on camera-It\u2019s kind of unbearable even now to ... It\u2019s on Netflix and it\u2019s also downloadable, so it\u2019s definitely, it\u2019s probably on my phone right now as we speak. Watching those scenes makes me really upset. Well then, I guess I did my job right, so I will take that as a compliment. Thank you. Congrats. I\u2019ll talk to you a little bit about \u201cTully,\u201d but let\u2019s talk about \u201cFront Runner\u201d since that\u2019s the movie that is out. That is the Gary Hart story. I think a lot of people who listen to this about tech, and media, and politics, will know the Gary Hart story, but want to give them the 30-second synopsis?Yeah, sure. Well, look, they may not. I\u2019m 41 years old and when I heard a Radiolab centered around Matt Bai\u2019s book on Gary Hart and the scandal, I didn\u2019t know the story. I was 10 years old when this happened and I was much more interested in the trajectory of the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d trilogy than I was about politics, at the time. Gary Hart, in 1987, was the presumed next president of this country. He was 10 points ahead of George Bush. He was 25 points ahead of every Democrat.Telegenic. I mean, charismatic, Kennedy-esque, and had big ideas. And look, this is a guy in the mid-80s who was saying, \u201cThis country\u2019s addicted to oil. That addiction\u2019s gonna take us into the Middle East, where we\u2019re gonna encounter Islamic terrorism and not know how to fight it.\u201d This was a guy who\u2019s kind of ahead of everything, and he had an affair. He met a woman at a party, on a boat, and invited her to his house in D.C. and a Miami journalist followed her there. And they wound up, Gary Hart and this journalist, a couple of others, in his alleyway in the middle of the night. In a scene that is right out of a movie, where no one knew what to do, \u2018cause no one had ever been in that position before. He famously told the press of it, and I guess it\u2019s the Washington Post, specifically, \u201cGo ahead and put a tail on me, you won\u2019t find anything.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s actually kind of a misunderstood part of the story. And one of the reasons I wanted to make a movie was that \u201cfollow me around\u201d quote, which is kind of \u2014 when you ask people about the Gary Hart story, and they say, \u201cOh, yes-\u201cMonkey Business.\u201d.... Monkey Business.\u201dAnd a photo. The name of the boat, and a photo. So, and what we misremember is that the \u201cfollow me around\u201d quote came out the same day as the Miami Herald article. They were already following him. They were tailing him, they in his alleyway. And then after the fact, it was kind of misremembered or retold because it\u2019s much more interesting to think that the guy said, \u201cFollow me around. Come get me.\u201d And then they did, when that didn\u2019t happen. And the photo, this famous photograph, came out six weeks after he left the race. So, he was done. He was already out of politics.I was gonna ask you. That wasn\u2019t in the movie.It\u2019s not in the movie because look, I\u2019m a filmmaker, I\u2019m interested in story. I\u2019m interested in how we remember things.It\u2019s an iconic image, at least it\u2019s burned in my head. Of course.I was 17 when it came out. So that-And that\u2019s what makes it so perfect. So, what I\u2019m interested in is, look at this thriller of a story. In less than a week, a guy goes from being the next president of the United States to leaving politics forever. A guy, who understood computing economy, Russia, the Middle East. He becomes president, probably don\u2019t go into Kuwait, probably don\u2019t go into Afghanistan, probably is not an Iraqi war. The history of our country is a lot different.So, instead of him, we get Michael Dukakis and Michael Dukakis loses to Bush in a landslide. Yeah, of course. Right. So, but what do we remember? Do we remember that, \u201cHuh, we kind of gave up on this guy in less than a week, perhaps this is worthy of debate?\u201d No, what we remember is, \u201cThat boat sure had a funny name\u201d and this photograph that actually came out after the fact, we re-contextualize and make that the idea itself.This is about media, this is about politics, this is about hubris. What does this story, set in \u201887, tell us about 2018 politics?Well, I think it brings up all the questions we\u2019re asking now. The questions about gender politics, the questions about where does a public life start and where does a private life start? Particularly in the era of a reality TV presidency and the celebrification of presidency and politics. And this line, this wall that goes up between the candidate and the press. In 1987, when this moment happens, it becomes the job of the press secretary to never let this moment happen again and because of that you get only manicured statements. You have zero relationship, real\u2026 Prior to Gary Hart, politicians and journalists ... You know this, I don\u2019t mean to say this as if you don\u2019t know this, but they\u2019re socializing together. They\u2019re drinking together. They spend time. The journalists knew who these candidates were as people and they could tell us who they were.And there\u2019s a line there, I think you attributed it to Ben Bradlee in there, saying, \u201cYeah, we knew. We knew when Johnson was screwing around, and didn\u2019t report on it.\u201d They all agreed not to.And yeah, Ben Bradlee really said that. He also really said this other line in the movie which is, \u201cIf TV news starts covering something, if other newspapers start covering things, if tabloid news starts covering things, how do they not?\u201d And this is the moment also, where the Washington Post says, \u201cWe don\u2019t control the story anymore.\u201d And look, I wake up, I\u2019m like everybody. I wake up and the first thing I do, I check out my phone and I go, \u201cOh fuck, what happened?\u201d And almost always, there\u2019s a New York Times or Washington Post story and one is about something real, you know, Kavanaugh hearings, midterms, what have you. And then right next to it is from the same source, from the New York Times, Washington Post, a story about Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande. It\u2019s like, really? I\u2019m getting this same news from the same service and it\u2019s on a parallel level?So one thing that is ... I don\u2019t know if this is confusing, but I thought about it the entire time I was watching the movie was\u2026 If Donald Trump doesn\u2019t happen then I really have a good idea as to sort of where this movie\u2019s at. This movie\u2019s saying, \u201cthis is the beginning of sort of how we go to where we\u2019re at today now in terms of the celebrification of the president and the way we ask them to act and behave and the way we treat them.\u201d But the idea that a presidential candidate was blown out of the water because he had a single affair that was documented, right? We\u2019re in pussy-grabbing tape ... Donald Trump blows all that out of the water. Right? Yeah?I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true. I think he\u2019s a unique case and-Well, I guess that\u2019s one of the big fundamental questions of our age.Yeah, and we won\u2019t really know this for five, ten years, maybe longer until hopefully we are out of this hellscape and we have perspective on it. But-If we\u2019re allowed to look back, yes. ... Yes, seriously. But it brings up a lot of questions and right now we are trying to have conversations, but it\u2019s really difficult. You go on Twitter, the level is a 12. You get your head ripped off the moment you say anything on Twitter. So, there\u2019s something about having the prism of 1987. Having a story from another era where you can actually break this down and go, \u201cOkay wait, how did we get here?\u201dDo you and then ... I think you were intentionally removed from this, but do think Gary Hart deserved to be kicked out of the race for this? What\u2019s your take on sort of whether or not he should have been allowed to be a presidential candidate after this if you\u2019re having an affair?I don\u2019t have a take on that. And I purposely don\u2019t have a take on that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to tell the audience, \u201cHey, this is what you\u2019re supposed to think.\u201d I hate filmmakers who do that. Any time a director comes in going, \u201cI have the answer,\u201d I immediately tune out. What I\u2019m interested in is filmmakers who have questions, movies that have questions. And this is based on a book that had a lot of great questions about, all right, we seem to gloss over this guy pretty quickly, it went away like that, and we never really reconsidered the potential of this candidate, who he was, how smart he was, how thoughtful he was and what road we went on because of that. And I think we\u2019re looking to have this conversation: Here\u2019s a movie that has the opportunity for either side. It\u2019s a movie not from Gary Hart\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s from the journalist\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s from ... and even within the journalists, you have not only the Herald and the Post, but even within the Post, you have a conversation between five different journalists and editors trying to figure out the right thing. It\u2019s his campaign people who are in the midst of a scandal and you have men on the campaign trying to save him. And you have a young woman, who\u2019s tasked with the job of taking Donna Rice and bringing her home and is forced to look at this candidate that she\u2019s been sacrificing everything for and go, \u201cWait a second. Who is this guy and how do I really see him?\u201dYou do some really interesting stuff with Donna Rice. The way you introduce her in the movie. She is shot from behind. You don\u2019t see her face for a long time. She\u2019s sort of this body, which I assume is very intentional. Well, yeah. What I would tell people I was doing ... People would say, \u201cWhat movie are you doing next?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m doing the Gary Hart scandal.\u201d They would always do this ... They would go, \u201cMonkey Business! And what was her name? What was that blonde\u2019s name?\u201d And they would talk about her as though Donna Rice were an object. So, knowing their presumption, at first, we don\u2019t let them see her. You get to this boat scene, you think it\u2019s gonna be salacious, and you\u2019re not given that. And you\u2019re left to wonder, \u201cWait, why don\u2019t I get to meet her yet?\u201d And you only get to meet Donna Rice in the movie once her life has been stolen out of her hands. She\u2019s now a human being who was, is, smart, educated, ambitious, and her life was stolen from her. And now the audience, hopefully, has to rethink, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I went in with these presumptions about who Donna Rice was.\u201dI\u2019m assuming you were making this, still finishing the movie, filming, editing, when the #MeToo stuff broke out \u2018cause that\u2019s about a year ago. Did that change the way you viewed her character in any part of the story? Did you adjust the movie sort of because of that?I mean, it\u2019s interesting, right? \u2018Cause the movie has to be seen in light of the presidency, which happened after we wrote the movie and the #MeToo movement, which started after we wrote the movie. I\u2019m fortunate. I\u2019ve been working with the same producer for over 10 years now, Helen Estabrook, who produced \u201cUp in the Air\u201d and all these other movies we were talking about. And she and I have conversation about gender constantly. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why the relationship between Clooney and Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick is as interesting as it is in that movie, and it is certainly the reason that we took the approach on this film. Helen would say, and this is prior to the #MeToo movement, she would say, \u201cLook, you have to remember the particular burden that is put on the shoulders of women in the midst of a scandal. It\u2019s different than the burdens put on men.\u201dBecause it is almost always told as the man\u2019s story and this is either an unseemly look into his private life and we shouldn\u2019t have done it, or this is he\u2019s got a tragic flaw and he\u2019s not worthy to be president. But it\u2019s always about him and the woman is very often just a side story, if that. An object.Yeah, an object.And we were interested in what if you were the one female editor at the Washington Post and rather than just only speaking your side, you have to speak for your entire gender? What if you are the only woman on the Hart campaign, and because you are a woman, you are tasked with bringing Donna Rice home and get her back to Florida? And in those moments, you have these reflective moments between each other. What if you\u2019re Gary Hart\u2019s wife? What if you\u2019re Lee Hart?And you\u2019re not crying in a corner. You\u2019re strong and you want to stand by your husband. And you\u2019re angry at your husband, and your anger has to be exposed on a public level. And you feel, rightly so, that this anger doesn\u2019t belong to the press. It belongs to her. How do you think about that from the outside?You\u2019re releasing this movie on Election Day?Yeah, we\u2019ll be limited LA and New York on Election Day, and then it will platform out from there.Does that seem like a better or worse idea now than it did whenever, how many months ago?I mean, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a bit of a stunt. If I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s a bit of a stunt. There\u2019s only one thing that people should be doing on Election Day, and it\u2019s seeing \u201cThe Front Runner.\u201d No, it\u2019s voting.After they vote, they can go see your movie.After they vote, they can ... No, look. On Election Day, people are going to vote and they\u2019re going to be glued to their TV. And we\u2019re going to be seeing where this country is going. And that ...So maybe they can see it the day after.Exactly. Look, in the morning, we don\u2019t talk about \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d episode or the \u201cMad Men\u201d episode anymore. We talk about politics. We talk about what\u2019s happening in this country. That\u2019s our entertainment, and that\u2019s what\u2019ll be happening on Election Day. And I hope over the course of this month, as this film comes out, as you\u2019re looking for a way to kind of have a conversation, like a rational conversation about this moment and see a cool thriller of a movie that\u2019s entertaining and funny, you go see \u201cThe Front Runner.\u201dWe mentioned you had two movies out this year. The movie we just talked about stars Hugh Jackman. \u201cTully,\u201d which came out earlier this year, stars Charlize Theron. How do you get Charlize Theron and/or Hugh Jackman to star in your movie in 2018, 2017, 2016?God only knows! I\u2019m a very, very fortunate director, and I\u2019ve been lucky since day one. I was ... My advice to young filmmakers is always \u201cFirst, be born the son of a famous director.\u201dLet\u2019s spell that out. It\u2019s Ivan Reitman.Yeah.Made some of the great, great formative movies for me in the 70s and 80s.I love it. This is literally, by the way, I wish you could see this. This is the first time you are smiling in this conversation.Oh, really?Yeah. You started talking about my dad\u2019s movies, and by the way, that is what is unique about my father is my father\u2019s movies make people happier.Your movies make me happy too, but ...You admitted at the beginning of this conversation that my movies make you anxious.I also ... I enjoy anxiety.Well played.\u201cStripes,\u201d \u201cAnimal House.\u201dYeah. I once spent a summer watching \u201cStripes\u201d every single day.Oh my God. \u201cMeatballs.\u201dYeah.Which really struck a chord with me.By the way, my father was a CI ... what is it?A CIT.CIT, yeah.Yeah, yeah.Yeah, he was ... You know there was always one guy at summer camp, the guy who always has a guitar? That was my dad.Pretty much my ... I didn\u2019t go to summer camp, so my idea of summer camp is pretty much formed by \u201cMeatballs.\u201dNever?Yeah.Ever?Yeah, I went to like day camps. It\u2019s not the same.Got it. Where\u2019d you grow up?Suburban Minnesota.Huh. That\u2019s like lakes and stuff.Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s like a ...My parents weren\u2019t into it. I went to the JCC Day Camp, like gaga. It\u2019s not the same thing. I\u2019ll get into my siblings later. And then \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Must I mention \u201cGhostbusters?\u201dYeah, of course. Basically, all the Bill Murray movies. So you grew up with a dad who did that.Yeah.And was your thought, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do, too\u201d or \u201cI want no part of what my dad does\u201d?No, my initial instinct was stay far away.Yeah.I mean, why enter this profession? If you\u2019re the son of a famous director, clearly you\u2019re an arrogant no-talent that has an alcohol or drug problem. Why go into a job where this was the presumption of me? And I at first went pre-med, thinking...So you were really thoughtful about it, like \u201cI do not want to be ...\u201dOh yeah. I\u2019m aware.\u201d...a famous person\u2019s son doing what he does.\u201dI know how people treat those people. And I thought no one questions why you become a doctor. No one\u2019s ever like, \u201cDoctor? Really?\u201dAnd my father visited me at school and said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And I told him, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, being scared really isn\u2019t a reason to do anything.\u201d And he pushed me to follow my heart and become a storyteller and in that moment became the first Jewish dad in history to say, \u201cDon\u2019t be a doctor. Become a filmmaker.\u201dGood job, Ivan Reitman. So you got into movies that way, and I think you mentioned, he helped you produce some of the movies earlier on or some of the ...He produced \u201cUp in the Air.\u201d That was the only one.Oh, that was the only one?Obviously, I was very wary of my father being a producer on my work \u2018cause I was already thoughtful enough about nepotism and being accused of it. So \u201cThank You for Smoking\u201d was done ... \u201cThank You for Smoking\u201d was actually financed by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and David Sacks and these guys who had sold PayPal to eBay and found themselves billionaires and wanted to make movies.What was the production company then?It was called Room Nine Entertainment, which I guess was a college dorm room at Stanford?Okay.And they literally each cut a check for a million dollars, and that\u2019s how we made the movie.Good job, Peter Thiel. That\u2019s not something we often say on this podcast. But good for you.But in making movies today, \u2018cause you make the kind of movies that don\u2019t get made very much anymore. And if they do get made, they often are Amazon movies or Netflix movies. You put movies in theaters. We were talking about the Nicole Holofcener interview I did recently, and her movie is now a Netflix movie. She didn\u2019t get to make it in a theater, but you have figured out still somehow, some way to get these things into theaters.Look, I\u2019m really lucky. And it\u2019s what you brought up initially. I get to work with movie stars like Hugh Jackman and Charlize Theron who are interested in making thoughtful, interesting films. And I was lucky that Bron, this Canadian company that makes movies, that\u2019s making great movies, thought these two scripts were worthy enough to finance and produce.Have you thought about ... I\u2019m sure you have. What is your thought about making a Netflix movie or an Amazon movie instead of doing this route?It\u2019s an inevitable part of the journey now, right? And I\u2019m sure if I was growing up right now, I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it. I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, I watch everything on Netflix. Why would I care?\u201dI\u2019m in love with the movie theater process of going to see movies, in the dark, with a group. A collective audience, I think that\u2019s really important. Laughing with strangers, crying with strangers is really important. I\u2019m really grateful for film festivals because of that, as the movie theater experience changes.But look, your business, my business. It\u2019s all changing. Where we consume media has changed.So Nicole said her last movie was going to be a theatrically-released movie. It didn\u2019t work, and then there was some issue with casting and she couldn\u2019t get it financed with the cast she wanted. It eventually ends up at Netflix who says, \u201cYou want to make it with Ben Mendelsohn as the lead? Go for it.\u201dHave you thought about sort of the upside there, weighing that, \u201cIf I do it for Netflix, at least right now, I can make whatever I want\u201d versus \u201cYes, I want to have the communal experience of putting it in a theater and maybe that\u2019s worth it.\u201dI mean, here\u2019s the funny thing, is ... I\u2019ll tell you the week everyone sees my movies. I get emails always the same day, and it\u2019s the day my movie goes onto airplanes. The week they\u2019re on airplanes, suddenly I\u2019m getting emails from everyone I know.\u201cHeyyy!\u201d\u201dHey man, I love your film.\u201dYeah.\u201dI was on a flight to Omaha and, man, your film. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it in the theaters, but it was great on the plane.\u201dAnd you take that as a compliment.Hey man, if they want to spend two hours watching your movie, you should take it as a compliment.Yeah.And look, life changes, the world changes. A hundred years ago, movies didn\u2019t exist. So look, narrative changes, and we have to be flexible, to a certain extent. And the part of me that is in love with the movie theater experience, of course half of it is just a romantic clinging to childhood. And I love going to the movie theaters. Sometimes, I go and I buy a ticket and I buy popcorn \u2018cause I just want to sit in a movie theater. I don\u2019t even care what\u2019s playing on the screen. I love it.It\u2019s a nice feeling, especially in a good movie theater, too.Yeah. You know what? I like the crappy ones, too. And when I\u2019m traveling... I\u2019m a horrible traveling partner. I could be in Rome. I\u2019ll be like, \u201cWe should go see a movie.\u201d I love seeing how people watch movies around the world.Is it different?Oh yeah. I shot a commercial once in a tiny mining town in Mexico, and their movie theater was a small room with folding chairs and, do you remember those projection televisions? It was like a Mitsubishi with fake wood grain and the front would like hinge forward, and inside there was like a red, blue, and a green bulb...Yeah, yeah, yeah. You needed a lot of real estate for it.And they would project on the inner screen of the box?Yeah, you needed a big living room for it.Yeah. But that was the movie theater there. And the craziest movie was playing. You would never guess if I gave you a hundred guesses and put a million dollars on the line.We won\u2019t sit through a hundred guesses. What was it?Muriel\u2019s Wedding.Oh, yeah.Yeah. There was no way you were going to guess it.They just found a movie, and someone said, \u201cWe have this movie. We can play it.\u201dOr they just have great taste. It was a great film.Excellent. So you think inevitably that one of your films is going to be on Netflix or on Amazon or on Apple, and it\u2019s just going to happen. And you were going to just sort of suck it up?I mean, I have to imagine, that\u2019s just how...Or you\u2019ll hold out as long as you can?Look, you want people to see the movies. And look, I\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve directed movies that go straight to Netflix and everyone sees them. If you\u2019re up on the front screen on Netflix for a week, forget about it. That\u2019s millions of people who are otherwise never going to see it.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re making ... you want to get into the movie business today and your dad is not Ivan Reitman. Just imagine.I can\u2019t relate. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.What are you doing? Are you making movies on your phone? Are you not making movies? Are you saying movies are an outdated form and we\u2019re going to make TV?No, no, no. Definitely not an outdated form. I think, look, this is the exciting thing about right now. The democratization of filmmaking is happening. When I started, you needed to buy film, you needed to rent a film camera and get the insurance that went along with that, you need to process this film and get it somehow inside an Avid or, if you were older than me, cut negative.Now, look, Sean Baker made \u201cTangerine\u201d on an iPhone. Sean Baker made one of the best films of the year that came out. And it was all on an iPhone. If you have a phone, which is most people ... I\u2019m presuming that you can get a phone.Yep.All right? Let\u2019s start with that barrier to entry. It\u2019s got to have a good enough camera to shoot something. You can download all kinds of software to edit, most of it free. And you can distribute through YouTube or whatever you like. And you can reach millions of people. You have a kind of a group of filmmakers who are learning to edit.You look at the kind of hypercutting of young editors on YouTube, and it kind of blows you away.And you think that\u2019s directly the result of technology. That\u2019s not having the ability to get the stuff. It\u2019s the ability to experiment.Oh, sure. Think about it. The old way was, you play a concert the day you learn guitar, right? And your first time you ever play out, of course you don\u2019t know how to play guitar. You literally just picked up the instrument.Yeah.Now, you have ... Think about how young people know their angles and the use of light, and the use of lens. You see people take selfies, and they\u2019re raising the camera, because they understand what it does to their face. All these ideas of lensing and camera work are things that are just inherent to a generation. And you would pick up your phone, and you still think you\u2019re making a 90-minute movie, because that\u2019s the form you like, and that makes sense to you?Duration is obviously a really interesting question. Our attention span is shrinking, and yet we are in love with these kind of eight-hour pieces, these, what used to be called miniseries, but I don\u2019t even know what the modern name is for it. That\u2019s only interesting. That\u2019s what compels me. Narrative is flexible, and that we\u2019re ready to consume all kinds of stuff. So you\u2019re not fixated on, \u201cNo, it should be a two-hour thing, because that\u2019s the best form for this,\u201d as opposed to, I don\u2019t know, I had Steven Soderbergh on, and we talked about \u201cGodless,\u201d and that\u2019s 10 hours. There\u2019s something about the duration that seems to work. You have plays going back historically, which are around that duration. You know that thing where whatever that 90 beats per minute, or 100 beats per minute, is the beats per minute that we\u2019re naturally drawn to? If you clap your hands three times and you do it too slow, they\u2019ll speed it up, the fourth clap. If you clap it too fast, they\u2019ll try to slow it down. Somehow, we have a biorhythm that takes us to a duration, and for whatever reason, plays, movies, we want to watch movies around that length. You think that\u2019s the natural state. And I mentioned the release date for \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d do you spend time getting involved in marketing/promotion, and thinking about how these things are going to play out and participating in that strategy, or are you happy to hand that off to a studio that can do it?No, you gotta be involved, because you don\u2019t want people to lie. I want people to understand why we made this movie. And look, you look at the Gary Hart story, there\u2019s 10 different ways to spin it. There\u2019s one way to spin it as being pro-Hart, and another as being pro-journalist, and it involves so much plot, you have to get involved and go, \u201cHey, this is a movie that takes all sides. This is a movie that leaves it for the audience. You\u2019re gonna see it with somebody, and the two people in the audience are gonna see different movies, and you\u2019re gonna argue about it after.\u201dAnd I\u2019m not sure if all those ideas get out if I just go, \u201cHey, thanks,\u201d and walk away. We were earlier talking about a bunch of things, you mentioned your enmity for Facebook, which is now a more popular idea, to be anti-Facebook.I was early on that. Are you thinking we should be promoting this on social media? We shouldn\u2019t? Or we should push it out this way on social and this way on TV? Or that, you\u2019re happy to hand over?You have to, but I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert in that. And the studios are now very sophisticated with the people they have and the departments they have that are looking at the analytics and are figuring out ways to reach people. I gotta say, \u201cTully,\u201d which I just saw in preparation for this interview-How was the flight that you watched it on?I watched it on my Roku TV in my basement, and I took one break, which is, for me, that\u2019s the big reason to go see it in theaters, watch the whole movie, you don\u2019t get up and go talk to someone in your family. But it played great. But the only reason I knew about that movie, and it\u2019s kinda targeted right for me, was I heard you on Shawn Fennessey\u2019s podcast last spring. It seems like that\u2019s a movie that got drowned out, for whatever reason. There\u2019s a lot of noise out there, and it\u2019s hard to cut through, and I\u2019m not within the Marvel Universe. So these movies succeed because people talk to each other about them. That is the exciting thing about social media, it\u2019s an environment where people go, \u201cHey, I like this. Hey, I don\u2019t like this.\u201dDo you ever think, \u201cMaybe I should be in the Marvel Universe, maybe I could do a really interesting X-Men\u201d?I don\u2019t know. What Marvel movie do you want to see me make?I don\u2019t know that I do. But there is that idea, that you could do-No, \u201cRagnarok\u201d was amazing, the Taika Waititi film. And the Wolverine one. \u201cLogan?\u201dYeah. Well, that was brilliant. I don\u2019t think of that as part of the Marvel Universe, only because it was made over at Fox, who made it independently, it was really done as a director-centered film. Most of the Marvel movies are not director-centric. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a insult, I think that\u2019s just a reality. It\u2019s just, blow it out bigger. Are you interested in doing a really big budget thing with monsters and maybe it\u2019s related to some existing idea?If it had a core theme that I was into... OK, one day my father calls me and he says, \u201cYou gotta come over to the house and watch \u201824.\u2019\u201dAnd I\u2019m like, the Kiefer Sutherland show? And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, you gotta come over.\u201dLike, alright. So I go to my dad\u2019s house, he\u2019s got a movie theater in his house, we sit down. We watch four episodes, four hours of 24. And it\u2019s great, it\u2019s phenomenal. That show was really good. I\u2019d say to my dad, \u201cThere\u2019s so many shows about terrorism, why is this show so good?\u201dAnd he looked at me and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a show about terrorism. Terrorism is a location. This is a show about a man trying to save his family.\u201dAnd when I started to apply that to all filmmaking, this was one of the great filmmaking lessons I\u2019d ever learn. Don\u2019t confuse your location for your story. Juno is not a movie about teenage pregnancy. Teenage pregnancy is a location, a location to talk about innocence and the moment we decide to grow up. So when you talk about the science of a film, or aliens, or sci-if, all of that is location to me. If I got to tell a personal story as personal as all these other films are to me, as \u201cTully\u201d is to me, as \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is to me, within a larger movie, hell yeah, I would do that movie. Look at \u201cThe Fugitive.\u201d The Fugitive is a personal story. Even \u201cDie Hard,\u201d frankly, is a personal story. Yeah!\u201cDie Hard\u201d is a marriage clinging on for dear life, and there just happens to be these eastern European terrorists in Nakatomi Plaza. Sorry, I just went on a \u201cDie Hard\u201d reverie. Yeah, but think about how that movie ends. That movie ends with pulling the wristwatch off. Yep. Shoes off because he\u2019s anxious about...\u201cShoot the glass.\u201dYep. So great. Every day, we say \u201cshoot the glass,\u201d on set, because we\u2019re constantly using filters, things like that. And my DP Eric and I, who met each other when we were like 15 years old and can\u2019t believe to this day we get to make movies together, every day on set at one point it\u2019s like, \u201cEric, shoot the glass.\u201dI wanted to end with a big, thematic question but here\u2019s just the thing that\u2019s in my head. What, you don\u2019t want to end on \u201cDie Hard?\u201dNo, no. I love \u201cDie Hard.\u201d We could just do an entire \u201cDie Hard\u201d podcast. I don\u2019t know if anyone would listen, but I would listen. 1987, you make a period piece [set] in \u201887, what was the most surprising thing when you went back and researched what was happening in 1987 that you had to emulate or replicate?So much. Here\u2019s the thing with a film like this-Pre-internet. Which is the thing that always blows my mind. Yeah. So \u201887, you have the birth of satellite truck, which is creating the 24-hour news cycle. You have CNN giving satellite phones to their journalists to report for the first time. A current affair goes on television, it\u2019s the same moment as Tammy Faye Baker and \u2026 not Oliver Stone. Oliver North. And Oliver Stone, but yeah. A lot of things are happening at once, so the question as a director is, how do I get this information on screen without making the audience feel like \u201cHey, look at this. Look at that. I\u2019m spoon-feeding you.\u201dJust, where\u2019s the beef? How do you get that moment into the movie without spoon-feeding it to the audience?So the real task, and it was fun to do, was to find a way to just populate the screen with all this information that made it feel as though you\u2019d just happened upon something, you\u2019d accidentally saw that detail. Creating an environment rich with information that never was telling the audience \u201cThis is the point of the movie.\u201d Having three conversations going at once, where you have to make a decision that is similar to the philosophy of the film: What is important versus what is entertaining?And are you spending time going, \u201cLet\u2019s bring in that Spuds McKenzie ad\u201d and someone goes, \u201cNo, it\u2019s actually 1991, it\u2019s not period, you can\u2019t have it.\u201dBy the way, absolutely. We\u2019re thinking about, what were the popular movies, what were the popular songs, what clothes, what hair?And the 80s are tough, because the 80s are big hair and neon colors. It\u2019s that \u201cWedding Singer\u201d version of the 80s. So it\u2019s very easy to lean into this shocking pink version of the 80s that is fun but a little less real and not as nuanced as the film we\u2019re trying to make. So how do you capture this era with all its detail and texture, that is still true to a political campaign?Did you get feedback from authentic political journalists, who were around at the time?Yeah. Every campaign person, we would send this questionnaire, and the questioner would ask, \u201cWhat did you drink at the time? What did you eat at the time? Who was your favorite sports team? What was your favorite song? What did you always have in your pocket?\u201d All kinds of little questions. What was the most surprising answer in that questionnaire?The most surprising? I actually don\u2019t know if anything was that shocking, it was just a great level of detail. What does Gary Hart like to drink? If it was a bad day, a vodka, if it was a good day, a chocolate milkshake. That\u2019s a good way to end, right? Let\u2019s make it a chocolate milkshake day. Thank you Jason Reitman, you\u2019re great. We appreciate it.
