{"id": "Facebook found its new public face: Former U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg", "paragraph": "Facebook has filled one of its most important executive roles: Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister in the U.K. under David Cameron, is joining Facebook to lead all communications and global policy. It\u2019s an important job. Elliot Schrage, who has held that role inside Facebook for the past decade, was incredibly influential. He was a top adviser to Facebook\u2019s top decision makers, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, and help shaped Facebook\u2019s response to a number of important crises, including Cambridge Analytica and issues of Russian election meddling. Clegg will be tasked with handling those kinds of challenges moving forward. He\u2019s a rare outside hire for Facebook, which tends to fill its most important vacancies from within. Clegg\u2019s experience in British and European politics will be key given the European Union seems much more interested and capable of regulating Facebook than U.S. politicians. Bringing in a former British politician is also a sign that Facebook sees potential European regulation as a major concern moving forward. \u201cFacebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus and Instagram are at the heart of so many people\u2019s everyday lives \u2014 but also at the heart of some of the most complex and difficult questions we face as a society,\u201d Clegg wrong on Facebook Friday morning. \u201cThe privacy of the individual; the integrity of our democratic process; the tensions between local cultures and the global internet; the balance between free speech and prohibited content.\u201cI believe that Facebook must continue to play a role in finding answers to those questions,\u201d he continued. Clegg starts at Facebook on Monday, according to a company spokesperson. Facebook\u2019s head of communications, Caryn Marooney, and its head of public policy, Joel Kaplan, will report to Clegg. Clegg, meanwhile, will report to Sandberg, as did Schrage.
