{"id": "Everything that matters from Apple\u2019s iPad and Mac event in Brooklyn", "paragraph": "Apple hosted one of its trademark product keynote events this morning in Brooklyn, N.Y., introducing a new iPad Pro, MacBook Air and Mac mini. Here is the most important news from the show, in roughly chronological order:The theme for today\u2019s event is essentially Apple\u2019s \u201cmost creative products\u201d \u2014 and its products for creative professionals. Apple is holding the event in an opera house, its logo is being drawn in a bunch of different art styles, and today\u2019s introductory videos feel more art-house than Hollywood blockbuster. CEO Tim Cook didn\u2019t do much of a windup \u2014 we\u2019re jumping right into the Mac update.Apple\u2019s Mac business now has 100 million active devices. First up for an update: The MacBook Air, which \u201ctruly embraced the notion that less could indeed be more,\u201d per Cook, who says it\u2019s the \u201cmost beloved notebook [computer] ever.\u201dThis is a big update, arguably overdue, for one of Apple\u2019s most popular products.The new MacBook Air has a high-resolution Retina display \u2014 addressing its biggest shortcoming \u2014 plus two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The new display has 50 percent narrower borders and 48 percent \u201cmore color.\u201d The new Air now supports Touch ID to unlock your Mac or use Apple Pay, a feature Apple previously introduced in the MacBook Pro. It can drive a 5K external display. Apple is pledging 12 hours of battery life in \u201cwireless web browsing.\u201dThe MacBook Air is smaller \u2014 17 percent less volume \u2014 and 10 percent thinner, and a bit less than 10 percent lighter, weighing in at 2.75 pounds. It\u2019s made from 100 percent recycled aluminum.The new MacBook Air starts at $1199, the lowest price for a Retina Mac, but 20 percent more expensive than the old MacBook Air, which recently started at $999. Preorders start today, with availability next week.Apple is also making another long-awaited Mac update, a new Mac mini. \u201cThis new Mac mini is an absolute BEAST on the inside,\u201d Apple promises. This smallish device has had a weird history \u2014 Apple goes years between updates \u2014 but has a strong niche following, using it as a media center, to power conference room TVs and even in server farms. It will now support quad- and six-core processors, offering 5X faster performance, and up to 64GB of memory \u2014 a lot for a small device.The good news for Mac mini fans: Unlike Apple\u2019s laptops, which have been losing their ports, this Mac still has a bunch of them, including four USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, HDMI, Ethernet, etc. Its aluminum enclosure is now also 100 percent recycled. It starts at $799, with preorders starting today and shipments on Nov. 7.\u201cImagine a piece of glass that transforms instantly into anything you want it to be.\u201d That\u2019s how Tim Cook kicks off the iPad section of today\u2019s event, following a retail update from exec Angela Ahrendts.The new iPad Pro is a big cosmetic and functional update: Its screen now goes far to the edge, including rounded corners and Face ID, using similar technology as the new iPhone XR. It comes in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes, with the larger device having 25 percent less volume than its predecessor.The new iPad Pros use new Apple chips, the A12X. \u201cSingle-core performance\u201d \u2014 many simple tasks \u2014 are up to 35 percent faster than the last iPad Pro, and more sophisticated multi-core tasks are up to 90 percent faster. Graphics performance is up to 2X faster.As rumored, the new iPad Pro is moving over to USB-C \u2014 away from Apple\u2019s Lightning port \u2014 as its main connection point. This can power a 5K display or let you charge your iPhone from your iPad. The second-generation Apple Pencil stylus attaches magnetically and charges wirelessly. The new keyboard case does not include a trackpad.The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799; the 12.9-inch starts at $999.
