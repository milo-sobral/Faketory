{"id": "Twitter co-founder Ev Williams says in retrospect that showing how many followers you have wasn\u2019t \u2018healthy\u2019", "paragraph": "Twitter today has a health problem. And one of its first CEOs has a few ideas about some early decisions that caused it.Ev Williams, a Twitter co-founder and board member, said that, in retrospect, it wasn\u2019t a great idea for Twitter to show follower counts on user\u2019s profiles. The same goes for the Suggested User List, a project that Williams was highly critical of when he was CEO.\u201cI think showing follower counts was probably ultimately detrimental,\u201d Williams said at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. \u201cIt really put in your face that the game was popularity.\u201dWilliams\u2019s comments are revealing since they come at a time when the current CEO, Jack Dorsey, is trying to measure the \u201chealth\u201d of his platform. Dorsey himself has said that follower counts can give users a negative incentive, though he has yet to float removing those from the site entirely.But follower counts were a huge reason why Twitter succeeded in the early days, Williams acknowledged. He recalled his appearance on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in 2009 when there was a highly publicized race between CNN and Ashton Kutcher to have the first Twitter account with a million followers.\u201cThat\u2019s the most amazing publicity of all time. So it\u2019s easy to say in retrospect \u2014 today \u2014 maybe we shouldn\u2019t have follower counts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA lot of these things drove growth, and if we hadn\u2019t had them, maybe someone else would have done them and built a much more dominant platform.\u201cBut today that\u2019s not necessarily healthy.\u201dThe \u201cworst\u201d product move, though, in Williams\u2019s eyes, was the Suggested User List, which allowed new tweeters to automatically follow a list of accounts that Twitter thought would be a good starting point for people new to the service without the faintest idea of who to follow. That led to some accounts achieving massive early success without necessarily providing a ton of value to the new follower.\u201cThis was my fault,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThose weren\u2019t really interest-based follows, and then someone who had grown their following organically compares themselves to them. It\u2019s inauthentic.\u201dWilliams is now the CEO of a different content company, Medium, and has taken an interest in the state of journalism. He\u2019s feeling pretty good about the way media companies are gravitating toward pay-for-content models, he said, but he\u2019s not in a rush to pay for a media company himself a la Jeff Bezos or Marc Benioff.He admitted when asked, though, that he\u2019s certainly given some thought to buying one.\u201cSure,\u201d he said after a pause. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t think about buying media companies?\u201dSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
