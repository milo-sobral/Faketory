{"id": "Bradley Tusk, a political \u2018fixer\u2019 for tech companies, has a plan to make voting from your phone a reality", "paragraph": "As an investor/political consultant for Uber, Bradley Tusk directed the company\u2019s aggressive efforts to mobilize consumers against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015, and has since led similar campaigns for FanDuel and Bird. These experiences gave him a thought: What if voting were this easy?\u201cIf you give people the ability to advocate politically on their phone, they will do so,\u201d Tusk said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. \u201cThe same people who would never vote in a primary, probably don\u2019t know what primary day is, are far more likely ... By the way, I\u2019ve had them acting on behalf of for-profit companies! Gambling companies, in some cases.\u201dHistorically, Tusk has taken equity in the companies for which he has worked as a political \u201cfixer.\u201d But now in order to \u201cfix democracy,\u201d he\u2019s funding and piloting a program for smartphone voting in West Virginia, with votes recorded and secured by a blockchain, and not taking a stake in the blockchain companies the state has partnered with \u201cbecause I want to not care who wins.\u201d For the pilot program, only deployed military members from 24 counties in West Virginia will be eligible to vote online in next week\u2019s midterms. But Tusk\u2019s theory is that, if voting becomes as easy for the general public as calling an Uber, the number of people who vote will increase dramatically, and elected officials will make completely different decisions as a result.\u201cTake an assault weapons ban,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cYou\u2019re a Republican Congressman from Florida, turnout is 12 percent in your primary, your district is gerrymandered, so the primary\u2019s the general election. Of that 12 percent, half are NRA members. You probably know intellectually that people toting an AK-47 around your district is not a good idea, but you can\u2019t risk alienating 50 percent of your primary voters.\u201d\u201cNow, people can vote in that same election on their phone, turnout goes from 12 percent to 60 percent, the NRA\u2019s vote share goes from 50 percent to 10 percent, the politics flip completely,\u201d he added.(Editor\u2019s note: This interview was recorded before Saturday\u2019s terror attack in Pittsburgh, where a man with an assault rifle and three handguns killed 11 people in a synagogue and wounded six others.)You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Bradley.Kara Swisher: Hi, I\u2019m Kara Swisher, editor at large of Recode. You may know me as someone who thinks \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is way too generous to politicians, but in my spare time I talk tech and you\u2019re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast network. Today in the red chair is someone who has sat here before, Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Holdings. He\u2019s a venture capitalist, the former campaign manager for Mike Bloomberg, I think he\u2019s been governor of Ohio at one point-Bradley Tusk: Illinois, deputy governor of Illinois.Oh, okay, whatever. One of those states out there. And he\u2019s also the author of a new book called \u201cThe Fixer: My Adventure Saving Startups from Death by Politics.\u201d Bradley, this is such a topical topic now since we last talked. Welcome to Recode Decode.Thank you. My book may also make \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d seem generous to politicians, by comparison.  Let\u2019s just talk, let\u2019s get to the background, explain who you are. Last podcast, you\u2019d worked for Uber, you\u2019d worked for a whole bunch of stuff about regulatory issues around tech companies, that\u2019s how we met. The things that are probably most interesting to this audience is I founded and run a venture capital fund called Tusk Ventures. We\u2019re the only fund that, I\u2019m aware of, that works solely at the intersection of tech and politics. So, we invest in and work with startups in regulated industries where we think that, by virtue of our work, we can really move the needle for the company.And you had worked for Mayor Bloomberg-Yeah, I\u2019ve been Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign manager, Chuck Schumer\u2019s communications director, you\u2019ve mentioned deputy governor of Illinois- For?... A guy named, Rod Blagojevich, who is now enjoying a 14-year jail sentence.Yeah, close for you, too.Yeah, and then started working with Uber in 2011, kind of figured out the whole strategy of how we mobilize our customers to beat the taxi industry and then broaden that into a broader venture business in 2015.And you had taken stock in these, that\u2019s what you wanted.Yeah.But your offer to them, because before for, I guess, even Steve Case wrote that book about the Third Wave, that a lot of these new startups are in regulated industries heavily. Your thing was, \u201cListen, you people don\u2019t know squat about local politics.\u201d\u201dYou don\u2019t know shit about politics.\u201d Yeah, right.And they didn\u2019t like it and they didn\u2019t want to be part of it. No, I mean the typical answer that I would get and for all of Travis\u2019s flaws, to his credit\u2014Travis Kalanick... Kalanick, right, \u2019cause we now also have Travis-He\u2019s co-founder and ex-CEO-Of Uber.... Ousted CEO. I like to say ousted CEO.He probably wouldn\u2019t like that as much. Yeah, too bad, that\u2019s what happened.But he did, to his credit, understand the need to take the politics seriously. So, I\u2019m working with him and it\u2019s fun, \u2019cause these are fun fights and we\u2019re winning, and-Super aggressive.... Value of my equity is skyrocketing, not realizing that there will probably never be one like that again. But I don\u2019t know that, right? So thinking, hey I should do more of these, and so I would get an introduction to some founder, and I\u2019d say, \u201cLook, you\u2019re in this regulated industry, here\u2019s who, if you\u2019re successful, you\u2019re gonna disrupt and take market share away from.\u201dRight, \u201cI\u2019m the fixer.\u201d... \u201cThey\u2019re gonna politically hurt you in this way, this way, and this way. I can try to stop that, and I\u2019ll do it for equity.\u201d Not realizing that not all equity is created equal, I didn\u2019t know enough to know that there was a difference. And the response that I\u2019d get consistently was, \u201cOh, you poor child, you don\u2019t understand. I went to Stanford, I was in Y Combinator. John Doerr\u2019s on my board, and when that stupid regulator sees how smart I am, I can do whatever I want.\u201dThat\u2019s when you pop him in the face. That\u2019s when in New York, you would pop someone in the face. Exactly. So there was a four-year period or four-and-a-half-year period from when I started working with Uber, and we took on ride-sharing around every market in the U.S., it wasn\u2019t a small undertaking. Until when I got other startups to start working with us, and then in raising our fund, same thing, every LP says, \u201cI want a differentiated strategy.\u201d It turns out they mean like a different font in the deck. Like when this political guy showed up and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get access to all these deals, because these companies are gonna really need my help, and they can\u2019t get my help without me having investment rights.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s too weird. And now that we are in Bird and Circle and Coinbase and Lemonade and Ro and all these companies.All right, name, name some of the companies you\u2019re in.So, in terms of the investment fund ...How much did you raise?I raised $37 million.Which is small.Yeah. Yeah, but we are vesting ...Any Saudi money? I\u2019ve got to ask this week.No. No Saudi money.Kuwaiti? Yemeni?No. So we were joking today ...Russian?\u2026 if you are a startup and you are desperate for money, Saudi is probably a pretty good target.Yeah, right. Yeah. If you have no soul. But move along, Bradley.Yeah, but I am assuming that ... $37 million, we invest mainly series A, sometimes C.So small?Yeah. I don\u2019t need management fees to run my business because I have other businesses that make money. So the much bigger upside from our perspective is earlier, and it is just more fun, right?Right.So Bird, we invested in their series A, we have been working all over the country to make scooters legal.Which is the scooters. Right? Having some trouble in San Francisco.Definitely in San Francisco, but we won Miami a week ago, New York is looking good, Chicago.We will get into all these things.We are in Coinbase, we are in Circle, we are in Lem \u2014So these are all bitcoin, I mean...Coinbase and Circle are both, yeah, exchanges for crypto. Lemonade, which is the insurance tech startup.Right.So the thing is getting them their license in every state in the US. Ro, which is a men\u2019s health-care company that has raised a gazillion dollars. FanDuel, Nexar ...Another problematic issue about gambling.Yeah, and that is why they need us, right? Nobody needs me if you do not have problems.Right, because money is cheap everywhere.Yeah, by definition, right? There are lots of VCs that can fund something, but if you say, \u201cI need to win this fight in 13 states, 18 cities, whatever it is ...Like a Bird.Like a Bird, like an Uber, like a FanDuel, like a Lemonade, whatever it is, then we are the only ones to do that.And you had spent your time in politics and doing all kinds of deals. So you decided to write this book, \u201cMy Adventure Saving Startups From Death by Politics.\u201d Talk a little bit about the book, and then I want to get into specifics around Bird and these other things with the new regulatory challenges in the next session. But talk about, so you decided to do this book ...For a few reasons, one is. ..\u2019Cause \u201cThe Fixer\u201d is not a good image, right? The fixer is the bad guy.Not necessarily, but my editor ... you know, some different profiles have called me that, and my editor really liked the title, and when Michael Cohen started being called that we were like, \u201cOh, maybe we should change it?\u201d And we were like, \u201cAw, fuck that guy, we are keeping our title.\u201dYeah. You sound like Michael Cohen.I grew up with his, his brother was my best friend growing up. I have known Michael for 40 years. I haven\u2019t talked to him for a while.\u201cI will fix that for you. I will take care of that.\u201dYeah, exactly. So, a few things. One, I actually just love to write. When I was in college I was in a writing program, like there was that moment when I decide, do I do writing or politics? I pick politics, it has worked out okay, but just the opportunity to, hey, I have still hopefully some writing ability, plus a story to tell, was enough to get people interested in the book itself. And look, we can work with, invest in a dozen startups at any given time, there\u2019s 17,000 I think in the U.S. right now, so even though I want the ones in my portfolio to do better than the other ones, I don\u2019t want any of them to get screwed over by like, pay-to-play politics and just entrenched interests squashing innovation.It is one thing when Facebook or Uber now or Google behaves badly. That is one thing, but when a series A company is not able to actually even compete because the casino industry or the hotel industry does not want competition, that is not cool and that is not good for anyone except them. So it was how can we help the other 16,188 startups that we can\u2019t work with at least think about this stuff intelligently? And so the book is, the first third is my experiences in politics; the good, the bad, the ugly. So Bloomberg, Schumer, Blagojevich, all this stuff. Next third was Uber and how Travis and I figured out how to basically mobilize our customers to beat the taxi cartel. And the last third are case studies that are hopefully still entertaining to read in the form of what we did for Tesla, FanDuel, Lemonade, Handy, Eaze, and so on. And ends with my argument for this thing we are working on in my foundation, which is blockchain voting. So people can vote in elections on their phones.It has to be. It has to be on their phones. We are going to get into all of this. And you have like sections on the thing of learning about politics and so, tech people do not know politics?No, they think they do.Yes, how so? Because when I, my lasting memory is having Bill Gates down to The Washington Post when I was there, when he was, right before the monopoly thing, and I\u2019ll never forget he said \u2014 he was in one of those editor meetings, we invited him there, and it was, oh it had to be in the 1990s sometime, like the early \u201990s, and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t need a lobbyist in Washington, I don\u2019t need lobbyists, I got some lobbyist up in Rockville\u201d, like some guy. And, a federal one. And I said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really arrogant of you, because I think people are going to start getting interested in your monopoly power.\u201dIt turns out he had a few issues, didn\u2019t he?Right! They didn\u2019t have any lobbying presence. Just one guy, and he became a big lobbyist for them eventually as they started to hire, and all I remember is saying to him was, \u201cYou know, Washington is full of ex-student-body vice presidents with subpoena power, and it seems to me that perhaps you do need that.\u201d And then since then, obviously they staffed up, Google staffed up, that\u2019s on the federal level, not just on the local level.But I think there are two reasons why. So on ...But has that changed? It has changed a little bit, because I think the combination of the really big companies having so many problems right now, combined with Uber and Airbnb and other startups just having lots of high-profile fights all over the country.That are regulatory. Their businesses are regulatory.All over the country, and all over the world, has certainly raised awareness. When we were first launching our fund, I had to beg people to meet with me about taking my money, now people will call and say, \u201cIf you are on a cap table, it signals that we are taking this stuff seriously, that makes other investors happy, if you want allocation.\u201d May or may not, but that is definitely sea a change in terms of mentality. But you still have people in tech who think they get politics, and that results in two things.One is really smart people who don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know, and they assume just because they have been really successful in one walk of life, that applies to everything. And the other is, because they are rich usually, politicians kiss their ass because they want their money. Do they really care about anything other than them writing the check? No! Not in the slightest. But you have to pretend. So they get asked, \u201cWhat is your view on health care, and education, and energy policy, and all of these things\u201d, that go in one ear and out of the other. Some staffer will pretend to take notes in the background, but it makes them feel like A, they know stuff, and B, oh I have all the access in the world because Chuck Schumer is my good friend.He is not your good friend. He is just a guy raising a shit ton of money. Right, right. But they misunderstand that all of the time.They misunderstand that. So how, have they gotten smarter, has tech gotten smarter? Because you know Google is one of the biggest lobbyists in Washington, just the way the TV industry had that, just the way everyone else ...I think I would argue that you have to sort of answer that question in two parts. There are startups and there is tech. Right. Because tech are the biggest companies in the world, so like every massive company is going to automatically get into lots of regulated issues and need, get lots of scrutiny.But this is an issue largely unregulated, which we will talk about.Had been, yeah. But now they are starting to get into places that are about to change.Right.And that is different from startups, which is where we tend to focus. Which is, by the way, most of the regulation, that tends to be the municipal and state level. And that is more around entrepreneur either has this new idea that is not covered in law, because if the bureaucrats could have thought of that they would be entrepreneurs and not bureaucrats. They start getting a little traction, a little market share, the entrenched interest does not like the competition, petition their campaign donors to the governor, the mayor, whoever it is. Right.They lean on them to lean on the regulators who say, tell them this is not allowed, and then we have to come in, beat up the entranced interest, and make sure the law is okay.Right. So that is different.So that is really different, and it fits a couple of different things, right. You have your Googles of the world, or Facebooks that were created in these frictionless environments. In some ways on the early end, it was much easier for them because they did not have to, there is no, there was not \u201cbig search\u201d before Google, right?Right, right exactly. They were in sort of green fields.Yeah. Well, there was media.There was media, but they, media, mishandled it for a very long time. So they were able to get really big without dealing with that many political problems. The turning point was when Josh Hawley, who will hopefully lose his senate bid in Missouri.I don\u2019t think so.Hopefully lose. I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t think he will lose, I just am going to hope he loses. He was attorney general, still is the attorney general, in Missouri.A bad Attorney General.He filed, about a year and a half ago, an antitrust suit against Google. And the reason that was so amazing, the Attorney General of Missouri has no jurisdiction over this! But, his polling clearly said, and he was running for Senate, more of your constituents and voters are anti-Google then pro-Google. That went from a world where say \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d and everyone would applaud, to now you have local politicians saying, Google is underwater in their approval ratings, I am going to go after them, right?That is different than the startup in transportation, in hospitality, energy. Like Bird or Airbnb, or FanDuel, or Lemonade. All of these companies that are basically tweaking the existing industries and are trying to make them a little better.Like Airbnb with the hotels or...Right, the way that ...Bird with people like sidewalks.Care/of, offering you know drugs, prescription drugs or supplements online. Yeah, exactly. So they are dealing with a different set of regulators, and usually the motives early on are entrenched interests who do not want competition, as opposed to..Or citizens that don\u2019t like..Sometimes, yeah. It depends on what he issue is. As opposed to the stuff we are seeing in Washington right now which are, holy shit these companies got so big, so fast, now we have real concerns about market power and antitrust and privacy and these things we have to deal with it. I guess maybe because most of my investments tend to focus on not just startups, but earlier stage startups, I don\u2019t want them quite frankly facing the techlash. I don\u2019t want them getting lumped in ...Which it is, techlash.Yeah. I don\u2019t want them lumped in with Facebook and Twitter.But they are, they are.They are sometimes, and that makes my job harder. So one of the things you do, in this book, you go through ideas about politics. \u201cIt turns out you can fight city hall, pick your narrative before someone else does, subtlety died long before Twitter, people want to be led, it is all fun and games.\u201d So the idea is trying to teach people politics, right? Yeah in a fun way. I hope you buy the book, but if you don\u2019t...Well you gave it to me.The listener. The one-lesson take away from this is 99.9 percent of politicians are desperately insecure, self-loathing people who cannot ... Thank you Bradley, we got that.Yeah. Who can\u2019t live without the validation of holding office. The attention they get in that job is like oxygen for you or me. We can\u2019t live without oxygen. They can\u2019t live without it. Which means, all of their decisions are going to be very logical, in the sense of, \u201cDoes this help me win my next election, or not?\u201d Whatever you want them to do or not do has to be framed in that context or they are not going to care. It does not matter how moral you are, or how right your issue is, or how many puppies you are going to save.I am thinking of the homeless issue right now in San Francisco, [Proposition] C. Yeah, well look at that issue.Well there is a lot of tech people fighting.Fighting there on both sides of that one. But ultimately the day to day would be enough people who do vote are frustrated and upset by the amount of homeless on the streets and they say, do something. And that leads to people taking action to \u2026 interestingly, the mayor in this case, has actually said this is not the right way to go, which is, I have not studied the issue that closely, but it is kind of admirable for a politician to do that.\u201cI want to tax rich people,\u201d yeah.This is, this would be an easy solution to show the voters that I did something, but it is not going to work so therefore I am not going to do it.So, back to your thing.So if I am listening to this podcast, and I am a startup I am trying to figure out, how am I going to navigate the regulatory environment, whatever your issue is, if you are going to disrupt anyone in political power, they are going to come after you. They do not thank you for your disruption. They don\u2019t say, \u201cIt is so wonderful that you are so innovative.\u201d They will punch you in the nose as hard as they can. And the politicians that they donate money to, it is in their interest to take care of their donors, unless you make it so unpalatable and so uncomfortable that they can\u2019t afford to do it.Right. The reason why we win these Uber fights would be a city council member who wins his or her seat with 9,000 votes, all of a sudden getting 14,000 emails from constituents in the district saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d \u201cOkay, I am not going to do this.\u201d So if you can\u2019t figure out how to frame your issue in that context, you have a really big problem.You are splitting it between local and sort of national and stuff like that. I want to go through some of these things. I want to start with local, so that we can figure out where that is going, because a lot of these fights are local now, and statewide. But then they morph into national. Because for example, California has passed a lot of laws, and I think Gavin Newsom is going to run a country, a separate country and run it as if, you know what I mean, if he becomes governor.He\u2019s going to become governor.But California already is out front on privacy regulation, out front on energy, out front on all kinds of issues. Especially big tech, diversity, net neutrality, and stuff like that. So I want to talk about the local thing first and then in the end talk about sort of where we are nationally, because I do think big regulation is coming for tech as we move along. Let\u2019s start though with the local stuff. So you, right now a lot of these companies, like Airbnb and Uber, and now Bird, which is a scooter company, and the others, Lime and Skip, and what else is there? There are so many of them, multi-billion dollar valuations for these things. Uber is investing in them and stuff like that. So talk a little bit about where we are on those. Talk about your experience with Bird, for example.So it is really interesting because Bird, the easy narrative for people is to say Bird is Uber 2.0. Both really, really fast-growing companies, both CEOs named Travis, the Travis at Bird worked at Uber. The reality is, in some ways they are similar but in many ways, they are different. So my vantage point is the political and regulatory strategy around legalization in different markets. With Uber, it was pretty much an all beg for forgiveness approach.So when he would go in and make trouble, like, I was just thinking the other day. Someone was saying, every company that\u2019s been successful has broken rules and then they clean up afterwards. Facebook, Google...If Uber didn\u2019t take the path, I believe, it\u2019s my strategy, so of course I am defending them. If we did not take the path that we took, there wouldn\u2019t be an Uber together. \u201cRemember that thing, it was kind of a cool idea that did not make it?\u201d Taxi was so politically powerful, that the only way to beat them was with real people. And they only way to get real people was to launch and gain some market share, and then mobilize them. So that was the only conceivable strategy. It is different with Bird because there is no big scooter. We are not really disrupting anybody.Well, yes, go ahead.And the issues that are involved, in fairness to the regulators, are legitimate public policy issues. Should we be on the sidewalk or the bike lane, on the street? Helmets? Insurance? I mean, they\u2019re fair questions, right?Right. We can go through any of them. Where should you be located?All of it. Yeah, where should you be located? Where should you charge them? Where can you park them? Where should you ride them? Should a helmet be mandatory? Age minimums, all of that stuff. Fair questions, right?Mm-hmm.There are jurisdictions where the law in no way prohibits scooters. In those cases, there\u2019s no reason to not launch and kinda work through that stuff-Right.With the local regulators.So do you dump them on the streets? In some places, and then in other places like here in New York, the law clearly does not allow it, and we\u2019re working with the city council right now, legislation that\u2019ll be introduced shortly ...Yeah, there\u2019s no scooters. It\u2019s weird.Not yet. My office. Those are the only ones.Yeah, I know. It\u2019s weird to not. Like in DC, I use them all the time.Yeah. They\u2019ll be here soon. My hope is that by the end of this calendar year, we pass it.Right.But Chicago, Philly, Boston, Seattle, they\u2019re still not even there. Right? We just passed Miami. Bird isn\u2019t, but the others are.The others are.Yeah, I wanna talk about why certain ones are getting picked.Yeah, so, but ultimately, it\u2019s a different process because you don\u2019t necessarily have to beg for forgiveness because there are places where-There\u2019s no laws.Yeah, there\u2019s no laws, or they\u2019ll just say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re not opposed to this, but these are valid public policy questions. Let\u2019s figure it out.\u201d Right? And to Bird\u2019s credit a lot of what we\u2019ve been tasked with is, \u201cOkay, go figure it out with Chicago. Go figure it out with Seattle. Go figure it out with New York.\u201d Right, but initially they\u2019d been dumped. They did. That was a little bit before we got involved.Right.And it was more of the original Uber strategy.Right.Of just dumping.Like 300 scooters on the corner.And the backlash led to at least one kind of at least temporary ban, which was in San Francisco where Bird right now doesn\u2019t operate. The city gave out some permits, picked a couple of winners, and Bird was not one of them. Now, San Francisco, I mean, you\u2019ll either totally agree or disagree with this, but it\u2019s almost a two-part thing if you\u2019re a startup trying to enter that market compared to every other market. So part of it is, it\u2019s a reasonably big city, but the Bay Area is really where the heft is. It\u2019s not so much the city itself.So it\u2019s less about market share and opportunity. It\u2019s more around media and VCs, senior product, and get interested. And Bird doesn\u2019t have an exposure problem, right?Right. Everybody in the tech world knows Bird. What they have now is a city of 800,000 people that they can\u2019t operate in.Right. An important city.Yeah, and important city. Now, it\u2019ll come back because it is too important to ignore, but it\u2019s such a big world out there that right now, there\u2019s so much to do, and what\u2019s interesting is, I believe that scooter adoption internationally is gonna be a lot easier than ride sharing adoption internationally was.Okay.Because ... the rest of the world is less car-centric than the US. The rest of the world is already used to different ways to get from point A to point B, whether it\u2019s a bike or a rickshaw. I mean, right before I invested in Bird, I happened to be in Tel Aviv, and these people were scooting by me on e-bikes, and I was like, \u201cOh, this could probably cut down some traffic in Manhattan.\u201d So I think in a weird way, it makes more sense, and it\u2019s more intuitive to the rest of the world. So ... we\u2019ll get to a lot of other markets a lot faster, and we\u2019re already in parts...So you don\u2019t have to do your ... Not quite the same.Bossy ...It\u2019s a difference that ... yeah, look. There are, in any given cases, people who are unreasonable and will we mobilize 10,000 customers to speak out on behalf of the bill? Absolutely. Totally.Right.Totally we can do that.And the other issues along with scooters are obviously safety ...Yep.Helmets.Yep.Deaths. There was just a death in DC.Yep. Lime.With Lime, not Bird. Well, I\u2019ve used all of the scooters in DC. There\u2019s just two there, it seems like. It\u2019s Lime and ...Lime and us and honestly I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anyone else or not. I didn\u2019t notice it. I didn\u2019t see Skip. They haven\u2019t entered there. But as you have these issues and they come up, this is going to be something that\u2019s going to be a continual regulatory ...Yeah.As people aren\u2019t anticipating what could happen with these things.No, and it\u2019s also why I think we need to be able to have pretty good relationships with the regulators, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slash-and-burn strategy here.Right. There are other times where it\u2019s just an existential ... Lemonade, for example. We-This is an insurance, explain Lemonade.This is an insurance startup. It\u2019s grown incredibly fast, and it provides property and casualty insurance online, and effectively, if you have no offices, no brokers, no agents, no Super Bowl ads, and really good tech, you can offer people a much better product for much less.Mm-hmm.Which is what Lemonade does.Right.So it\u2019s doing insanely well.Right.Because lots of people, and the same way that people had never really just used Taxi World instead of using UberX, people who just never bothered to get renters\u2019 insurance, now are because they can get it for $5 or $10 a month, and they can get it on an app in three minutes.Right.Lemonade also, by the way, doesn\u2019t investigate fraud. They just pay out the claims, so it just makes life a lot easier for everyone all around.So ... but you can\u2019t sell insurance without a license, and it\u2019s not one of these, \u201cMaybe I can beg for forgiveness. I can interpret the statute this way.\u201dRight, no.You can\u2019t do it.Right.And you can\u2019t really launch an insurance company in the US without being able to sell in New York.Right.Because it\u2019s the financial capital of the world. Right.And in this case, the regulators in the state department of financial services, were just in a very kind of bureaucratic way saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll launch when I say so, and if this is at the bottom of my desk, and I don\u2019t get to it for nine months, that\u2019s your problem. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it because I\u2019m the one in charge.\u201dWhich worked until Lemonade hired us, and we invested and took equity, and then all of a sudden, we shifted the decision-making from the agency to the governor\u2019s office, made it a political issue for the governor. Eventually, I had to sort of call over there and say, \u201cLook. Front page of tomorrow\u2019s Wall Street Journal is gonna say one of two things: \u2018Hot, great insurance startup leaves New York because of corruption and bureaucracy,\u2019 or \u2018Low-cost insurance launches in New York thanks to governor\u2019. You guys pick.\u201dOh, do you really make calls like that, Bradley? Sometimes.Sometimes.We got our license-\u201d\u2019Cause I can run the Wall Street Journal!\u201dYou know.\u201dI got it dialed in over there.\u201dThere\u2019s a reason why sometimes a high-profile attack - it helps you hit other campaigns where you actually don\u2019t have to attack because they just know that you can or you will, right? So that\u2019s insurance.Yep.And then another local one. FanDuel.FanDuel. Right. Explain what they do.So FanDuel right now is a fantasy sports platform. People can pick lineups.Right.And bet based on skill, money, on that.Right. And betting has been a big issue.Always, because there\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s always politically controversial. It tends to be not liked by both the far left and the far right for different reasons but still not liked.So FanDuel and DraftKings both kind of just launched, and they grew into really big businesses really fast, didn\u2019t really deal with any of the political ramifications of what they actually needed in terms of licenses or permits or laws or anything else, and then all of a sudden, the Times publishes this story in October of 2015 saying, effectively charging that there\u2019s insider trading, DraftKings employees using proprietary information to win money on the FanDuel site.Right. Right. That actually turned out to not be true, but it just set off this shitstorm, right? Yes.All of a sudden, attorney generals from all over the U.S. are investigating, states left and right are popping legislation saying, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna ban FanDuel. We\u2019re gonna ban DraftKings,\u201d and we had to go run campaigns in over 20 states to legalize the product.Luckily, fantasy sports is one of those things that regular people who do play it really care about it.Like it. Right.Yeah.And who like it.So these bros who love fantasy football, not only do they not know who their state rep is, they might not know there\u2019s even such a thing as a state rep, right?Right.But when it was like, \u201cLook, if you wanna keep playing this thing, you gotta send this email. You gotta tweet,\u201d they did. So we were able to legalize it, but what\u2019s interesting now is the Supreme Court in May overturned a local past vote with prohibited the states from conducting their own sports betting.So now, every state can decide for itself whether or not it wants to do sports betting.Right.Which means you\u2019re gonna have this free-for-all battle royale in every state capital now for the next couple of years for who gets those licenses.And who gets the licenses, and also people who are against it because there\u2019s a big constituency that\u2019s against it.Yeah, you\u2019re gonna have states like New York \u2014 actually, this is probably way too policy-esoteric, but ... the blue states that got screwed over in the Trump tax bill by the elimination of the SALT deduction are really gonna need revenue, so all of a sudden, things like sports betting or recreational cannabis are gonna be really appealing to them.Right, we\u2019ll get to marijuana in a second.Because it\u2019s a way to generate revenue without having to tax regular people, so it\u2019s politically safer and easier, so that, I think will carry the day in those states.I think in red states where A, there\u2019s a bigger kind of Christian-right presence politically and B, they didn\u2019t get screwed over in the tax bill in the first place, it\u2019s gonna go a lot slower. So like, Texas is still gonna be years away.Right.But New York, Illinois-And they\u2019re willing to forgo this.Totally. Because the political pain there will be greater than the political benefit of the income that would bring.Right.It\u2019s just a calculation, but that\u2019s the calculation, whereas New York, Illinois, constituents don\u2019t really care.Right.But they don\u2019t wanna have services cut or pay more taxes, so whether it\u2019s Cuomo in New York or it\u2019s gonna be Pritzker in Illinois, they\u2019re gonna do this. Right. So you moved over to cannabis too.Yes.\u2019Cause that\u2019s another. So betting cannabis. This is another-Yeah, totally local.Except that Jeff Sessions keeps, that little goblin keeps weighing in.Yeah, it\u2019s a really fascinating issue. So we\u2019re in a company called Eaze, which for those of you in California know it, it\u2019s Uber for weed. It\u2019s literally on-demand weed.Right.You scan your driver\u2019s license.Call it, you bring it.And they bring it to you in five minutes.There\u2019s marijuana everywhere in California, so there\u2019s nowhere you can\u2019t get it.Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed that. So, but even when California legalized recreational ...And Colorado had before, and Oregon, is that right? Yep, and Washington state.Washington state.Alaska. But the decision to allow delivery is a local decision, a municipal decision, not a state decision.And explain how local works. You put in your driver\u2019s license ... Yep, you put in your driver\u2019s license, and you answer a couple of questions, and then assuming that they scan it and check it against the database, and if you\u2019re approved, then they can deliver you cannabis.Right.And it\u2019s drivers, not unlike-Right. And you go to a dispensary and get it.Any other product. Yeah. They get it, and they bring it to you.They don\u2019t hold the inventory, right?No. They\u2019re just moving it from point A to point B.Right. Right. Yeah.And you\u2019re paying on a credit card, so they\u2019re not walking around with lots of cash, either.Right. And ... the decision whether to allow that in any given jurisdiction, at least in California, is a municipal decision, so we had to run campaigns in LA, San Jose, all of these different markets to allow delivery in the first place, so it couldn\u2019t be more local.What\u2019s really interesting about this issue, or least for people like me is, you have this incredible juxtaposition where it\u2019s everywhere in California, it\u2019s legal on every different level, and yet federally, it\u2019s still completely illegal, right? Cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug, which is like heroin or cocaine. I mean, from a VC standpoint, it makes investing in the sector, I would argue, a little tricky because ... we\u2019re allowed to invest in whatever we want, but we don\u2019t have that much institutional money \u2018cause we\u2019re a relatively small, early stage fund, but if you are a big venture fund, and you have a lot of pension money and endowment money, you\u2019re not allowed to invest in cannabis because it\u2019s still illegal federally, right? And the Indiana teachers\u2019 retirement system doesn\u2019t want you doing it, and they\u2019ve given you $100 million or whatever it is. But what it means is, there\u2019s less liquidity, less money from VCs to go into cannabis tech than other sectors, which means the ability to lose money while you\u2019re scaling is a lot less than it is for say Bird, right? You can just put scooters everywhere, and it doesn\u2019t really matter. Right.And people can negotiate much better terms because there\u2019s fewer-What\u2019s the challenge locally with these as you move in? \u2018Cause the states, there\u2019s more and more recreational use...The states are gonna keep going. I think you\u2019ll see another half a dozen states in 2019.Which ones are coming? New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Connecticut ...Sounds like Democratic states.Ohio ... yeah, it\u2019s the states that are gonna lose a ton of money in the SALT deduction that was removed from the federal tax bill, they\u2019ve gotta make it up somewhere.Right.So-And they\u2019re states that would.And the people and the voters are there.They\u2019re the first pro-gay states, they\u2019re the first...Yeah. I mean, the views on this thing have evolved so much that it basically polls 2-to-1 nationally now.Right.So, states have to decide now whether to allow it recreationally or medicinally, but I think, you know.And then ... the issue of delivery will be different everywhere, right?Right. Right.In some states, they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou know what? We need to throw a bone to all the local mayors. We\u2019ll give them the power to decide this, and they can wrench concessions or whatever we need out of the delivery companies.\u201dRight.Other places, it\u2019ll be included in the statewide legislation.Right.So it\u2019s kinda like ... sports betting or eSports or a lot of these kinda new sectors, autonomous. It\u2019s gonna take on a totally different patchwork regulatory system.And then there\u2019s one more local issue I wanna talk about, which is like this was happening in San Francisco and homelessness, is that tech companies living there and whether the cities acquiesce to them too much. It\u2019s like what Bezos is doing in the Amazon Headquarter fight, and stuff like that, and whether mayors are too - like there was a whole Ed Lee, who had died, was considered in the pocket of tech and stuff like that. Yep.And whether these very wealthy people should be getting these breaks or what they should do to contribute to the fabric of the city. And right now, there\u2019s a fight in San Francisco over homelessness and there\u2019s many sides, as to whether they should tax these businesses, which are big employers.Yep. In San Francisco, for example. That\u2019s just a good example of it.Yeah. I mean, look. It\u2019s a tough issue \u2018cause in some ways, cities bend over backwards to accommodate tech because ...Anything.They want the job creation and they want - or by the way, you\u2019re right, anyone.Right.Politically, nothing better than a car plant.Right, yeah.That\u2019s a million times better than a startup.Right.Or even a big Facebook office or something like that.Right.Politicians will spend taxpayer money in different ways to be able to have the announcement that they just created 2,000 jobs.Right.Or whatever it is.Right.So, I mean, that\u2019s been true throughout time. That\u2019s still true. I think, to me, the real challenge is, tech often lives in isolation in these cities. They\u2019re kinda walled off.Right.And as a result, they\u2019re not part of the discussion, right? So ... take like Aaron Peskin, who\u2019s a really well-known supervisor in San Francisco and leads a lot of the kind of anti-tech legislation.He does. He\u2019s exhausting.But one of the things about-Aaron Peskin, you\u2019re exhausting.Yeah, but for his politics, the people who vote in a board of supervisors primary are not tech employees, right? They\u2019re people who\u2019ve been in that district for 40 years.And they\u2019re sick of their rents going up.They\u2019re sick of their rents going up, they\u2019re being priced out, so it\u2019s good politics for him to lead those issues, and if tech wanted to A, stop the Aaron Peskins of the world, and B, be more integrated into the decision-making, so you\u2019re not either the hero or the villain at all times, you gotta get more engaged, right?If you\u2019re a big startup in San Francisco, you are crazy on primary day not to basically tell everyone, \u201cNo one comes in \u2018til noon because I need you all to go vote.\u201d Right.Right. You are crazy not to try to put your people on community boards. You have to be able to start integrating, so if you plan to be in this city, your ability to either protect yourself politically, advocate for yourself, or get fucked politically is totally based on how engaged in the system you are, and this sort of arrogant notion of, \u201cWell, I\u2019m saving the world, so therefore I don\u2019t have to do anything else ... \u201cOr I\u2019m sitting up in my airy with my fantastic food ...Doesn\u2019t work.Below, the streets are disgusting, and I\u2019ve caused damage.It doesn\u2019t work. I mean you had the column a couple weeks ago, where you talked about the Chief Ethics Officer for tech companies.Right. This week. Yep.This week, yep. And ... I would love to see that. You could even take it a step below and just say, \u201cHow about a VP for Common Sense?\u201d Right? We have all these people living on the street, and we\u2019re bringing in these massive, expensive, catered meals. It looks fucking awful. We\u2019ve gotta do something about this problem.Right.And that might be that we\u2019re gonna do a big Meals on Wheels thing, or we\u2019re gonna-Well it\u2019s only Benioff who\u2019s done that.He\u2019s been great. Yeah, he\u2019s been terrific.And pissed off the others too, the switching.Yeah, I noticed the fighting. Yeah.Well, he changed his mind. It was interesting. I had so many discussions with others. He was against Proposition C, which was this homeless fundraising initiative, and in the emails, I have emails where he\u2019s saying he\u2019s against it, and then he changes his mind.Now he\u2019s for it.And he\u2019s for it, and what was great is they were, the people who were mad at him about it were like, \u201cWell he was against it, and now he\u2019s for it.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d What made him change his mind? Oh, he\u2019s saying it was \u2018cause of \u201cAncient Aliens.\u201d We have a joke. But no, he said he read some stuff, and he just decided there wasn\u2019t a better option, that we needed to do something now.Fair enough.You know what I mean? Yeah.And what was great about him is he goes, \u201cWell, I was against it \u2018til I was for it. So what?\u201d And then they were like, \u201cUh ... well, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI think you kinda can.\u201dAnd especially in politics and government, you cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.I think that he was... I think issue is, he went against London Breed, who is the new mayor there.Yeah. Yeah.And she wasn\u2019t for it, which, you\u2019re right. Why not take money from rich people? Which she doesn\u2019t want \u2018cause she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s ... it\u2019s a problematic legislation, but I think it\u2019s trying to deal with an issue that is massive in San Francisco.So just summing up local, so people should be involved if you\u2019re in tech, whatever, you\u2019re in Austin or you\u2019re in Santa Monica or-Look, if you were a total ... ironically, Salesforce is basically a B2B company that\u2019s not that regulated and yet they are heavily engaged with the community.Yeah.If you\u2019re working in an industry that just never gonna touch regulation at all, I guess do what you want, but the vast majority of companies are regulated either directly or indirectly, and the optics and the narrative that you have around your company has a huge impact on the regulations you then face, and you\u2019ve gotta be mindful of all that.We\u2019re here with Bradley Tusk. He has written a new book. He\u2019s been in the swamp for so long, right?Yeah.You\u2019re a swamp monster?I\u2019m dripping wet.Dripping wet. His new book is called \u201cThe Fixer: My Adventure Saving Startups From Death by Politics\u201d That\u2019s very dramatic, Bradley.My editor came up with it. It\u2019s a good one.Yeah, that\u2019s good. It\u2019s good. And you got like, so national politics. Right now, we\u2019re heading into the midterm elections. Give me your predictions, please. I need everything-Despite this talk in the last week or so of a resurgent red wave, I still think the math means that that Democrats take the House. Maybe with less of a majority than they expected-They just need 23, so they get 24. Who cares? Something like that. Yeah. Right.24 will give them-The Senate\u2019s not going to be there. It\u2019s funny because like, if you take Beto for example. Really exciting candidate, my wife\u2019s from Austin, her family lives there. I kept saying, \u201cNo, no, no, he can\u2019t win, he can\u2019t win. I understand politics. He can\u2019t win.\u201d And then eventually, because he\u2019s like the most popular guy, like in Manhattan or in San Francisco too-Well, he\u2019s gotten close. I\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s gotten ... He\u2019s pretty good.But it\u2019s always been like 8 points or something like, in reality, if you look at certain internals, those are hard races to win which means, given the map this year, the Senate Republicans in a normal year should have increased the majority by five or six seats. I think they may stay flat or increase it by say two or three seats. It\u2019s actually not a bad outcome for the Democrats, considering-And the governors are picking up a lot on-The governors, you\u2019re going to pick up a lot, and you have-That\u2019s the worst. -in some ways, like in Florida...Losing Governors is more important, I think.I mean, look, having worked in the Senate and having been a deputy governor of a big state, it is far more important running the state. You have far more responsibility, far more power, far more everything. You actually can\u2019t declare war, but short of that-California might.Texas seems to want to do that any time. There\u2019s all these people in California who want to break free. It\u2019s kind of funny. I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a lot more guns. We\u2019re going to need a lot more guns.\u201dThis is a somewhat depressing scenario, but you could see a world one day where we\u2019re multiple countries and not one. You know where it\u2019s some version of the EU, with some shared infrastructure. But ultimately you can say-\u201cCalifornia: We\u2019re going to take all our fantastic fruits and vegetables, and screw you.\u201dIf people-We want gay people to be happy.They\u2019ll trade and start putting tariffs on it, but ultimately, let\u2019s say that you are pro-life and you truly believe abortion is murder, I understand that you\u2019re fighting hard for that position, right? I don\u2019t agree with it, but I get it. I don\u2019t really see why people need to have guns, but my wife\u2019s a Texan and her family feels very differently about that so, you could say a world where people say \u201cwe just agree so strongly on so many threshold fundamental issues, we\u2019re just going to make our own laws, kind of how California\u2019s doing already, govern ourselves. We\u2019ll defend each other if there\u2019s an attack. We\u2019ll trade with each other, we\u2019ll share highways and things like that, but fundamentally, we\u2019re our own deal.\u201dThat\u2019s where we are now, Bradley. We\u2019re in name only. But there\u2019s not going to be three Californias and things like that. Not yet.Not yet. We\u2019ll see. But I do think California\u2019s going to operate like its own country soon. It already is.I think Newsom certainly has that vision in mind.He\u2019s got a lot of ideas about employment, he\u2019s got a lot of...You know what, there\u2019s no point in being in government to maintain the status quo. Anybody can do nothing. If you\u2019re going to take the time, and take all the arrows and slings involved-I\u2019m good with, hey, he did gay marriage. He went out front way before anyone else and that\u2019s leadership. It\u2019s called leadership.You\u2019ve got to do stuff, right.So let\u2019s talk nationally. So where are we nationally with the big, you know if you were advising Facebook or Google. I think those are the ones in the crosshairs, those two. Well, the most, right.And Apple\u2019s not really, Microsoft\u2019s not really. But they\u2019re getting pulled into it-They\u2019re getting dragged in.And they\u2019re furious about it. They\u2019re like, \u201cthey\u2019re like, having unprotected sex and we\u2019re getting the clap, essentially.\u201d They would use that metaphor. I\u2019ve heard it. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the clap! We\u2019re not promiscuous like they are!\u201dSo if I were Facebook, I mean it seems to me when you watch the Zuckerberg hearings, what I found infuriating was, they both maintained, both him and the senators, just maintained this ridiculous fiction where they both clung to a version of reality that everyone knows isn\u2019t true, right? So Zuckerberg says, \u201cOh, you can have all of your cat photos, and keep up with your eighth grade friends, and we\u2019re still going to respect your privacy and protect your data and everything else.\u201d That\u2019s absolutely not true because definitionally, the reason someone would buy a share of stock in Facebook is in return for being able to get the cat photos, you are agreeing to provide data that could be monetized. That\u2019s the whole underlying business model.Although they don\u2019t explain that explicitly. But yes, go ahead.No but that\u2019s what it is, right? But they sell everything. Like they would sell your shoes if they could.For sure. But they don\u2019t admit that, which I actually think people are able to understand the truth a lot better. And the senators on the flip side were like, \u201cOh you should be able to get everything you want from Facebook and have nothing monetized!\u201d Also impossible, that\u2019s not capitalism, right? And I really think the American people are able to handle the truth and just say, \u201cThis is what it costs to go on Facebook, in terms of being monetized, in terms of privacy, here\u2019s the risk, here\u2019s the reward. You decide.\u201d And I honestly think that if Facebook said, \u201cThis is who we are, we\u2019ve invented something that we think\u2019s pretty great, but it\u2019s brand-new so there\u2019s lots of unknown consequences.\u201d And said to the government, \u201cLet\u2019s sit down together and just try to work through all this stuff. Because we have ideas, you have ideas.\u201dLike they would with the mayor or-Yeah, and just do that, work with Congress, with the FTC. That\u2019s what I would do.Here\u2019s the problem. They act like they\u2019re running it well and they\u2019re not running it well. I think they just run it badly. The company.They have leaks everywhere. They\u2019ve been lazy in management. All these companies, they\u2019ve been sloppy.But they don\u2019t even need to pretend that they have all the answers, right? It would be-No of course not. But they\u2019ve resisted it completely, there\u2019s no-I know but I don\u2019t think anyone would think worse of them--well, because of the Communications Decency Act, the original sin, which is section 230 where they get broad immunity, so why would you clean up the ...This gets back to the other conversation around common sense.\u2026 oil spill when you\u2019re immune to the oil spill?Because common sense, ultimately ... There\u2019s a quote from Pericles, \u201cJust because you don\u2019t take an interest in politics doesn\u2019t mean politics won\u2019t take an interest in you.\u201d And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now, so they are far better off even at this late stage saying, \u201cThere\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know and so much you don\u2019t know, let\u2019s sit down together and figure it out.\u201d They\u2019re far better off having a seat at the table than resisting, resisting, resisting until they lose.Well, they kind of did that, like some of the congressmen was like, \u201cWhat do you want to do, Mark Zuckerberg?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cLet\u2019s not ask Mark today! Let\u2019s find some experts to look at this business.\u201dYeah, but there should be a real process, right? And there should be-So what do you imagine\u2019s gonna happen?I don\u2019t think either side will do that. Because that would be way too logical so it\u2019s not going to happen. So I think Facebook will keep off skating and keep acting like they\u2019re doing everything right when-No they aren\u2019t now, they are saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d it\u2019s like the annual-Sometimes the polls say to do that.It\u2019s the weekly \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAnd I think for as long as the polls say that Facebook\u2019s unpopular, the politicians are just gonna go after them, because that makes good politics.Right, which they do. Which those polls do.Yep. And then you\u2019re going to have a divided Congress, most likely, and a crazy White House. And unless the FTC or some agency brings an action-Well they don\u2019t have power. That\u2019s one of the issues in this internet bill of rights is giving the FTC more regulatory power.Right. Maybe DOJ has some jurisdiction in different ways, but unless that happens, my guess is if you\u2019re Facebook, you have two paths. You could just bottle shit up for as long as possible, deny reality, and just keep making as much money as you can. Or you can say, \u201cAt some point reality\u2019s going to set in, we\u2019re going to have to deal with this stuff. Why don\u2019t we get ahead of it, try to deal with it now. And bring in the agencies, both parties, the advocates, the experts, the professors, all around one table? It\u2019s going to be a brutal, painful, slow process. But at least we\u2019re actually trying to do something.\u201dCan enact some laws around privacy?Yeah, absolutely. You\u2019re going to end up with it.Like a national privacy law versus the one in California, which is the most stringent.Right, and then ultimately California might end up driving a lot of it anyway because companies don\u2019t want to have to live by two sets of standards within the US, right?So, if I were Facebook, I would be a lot more proactive about it, both because I think you would get to the better result, and I think also the optics and politics for you along the way-Do you think they\u2019ve been smart?No, not really. I just think that they think, and politicians think, that most people are stupid. And I think people are a lot smarter than they get credit for.What about Google?Google\u2019s interesting right, because it doesn\u2019t have quite the same fallibility as Facebook, right? They\u2019ve made so many of the mistakes, but they still have this fake news stuff, the bot stuff.They have issues. There\u2019s two things, right, there\u2019s the issues around things like fake news and privacy and bots-Their \u201cconservative bias,\u201d anti-Yeah ,and that\u2019s all, again I would do the Facebook answer there and say, \u201cLet\u2019s work proactively with the government to try to figure out what to do about this.\u201d Because these are new issues and we don\u2019t know the answers, either. Antitrust is a different question. They very well-We\u2019re getting to Amazon in a minute. But I want to give the fake news, because it has political elements, right?Yeah, for sure. But if you\u2019re Google, I mean maybe they\u2019re so smart that they know the exact answer and they\u2019re just not telling us. But my guess is they have no fucking idea. And so as a result, why not just admit that and be part of a process to try to figure out the right solutions?So you\u2019re advocating they get ahead of it, right?That\u2019s what I would do.It seems to have gone too far, I think the Democrats are out for blood. Now.For now-For the Russia thing, for-Yeah. But there can be...They\u2019ll get over it.Yeah, they\u2019ll get over it. You can pay your pound of flesh, but still long term, it\u2019s a lot bigger-And lastly, Amazon. Because that\u2019s local and federal, and global.Well it\u2019s funny because they\u2019re the darling locally, at least until they tell which cities, all the other ones are not going to get HQ.Yeah I know, that\u2019s what Scott Galloway said, there\u2019s going to be 140 other cities that are pissed at them.Yeah exactly. But until that moment, they are the darling of cities, they have all kinds of local issues, like for example, can they start delivering with drones? Or whatever it is. And then on the federal level, they\u2019ve got antitrust. I think one brilliant, of many brilliant things that Jeff Bezos did, is in buying the Washington Post. Whether he meant to do this or not, he made the enemy of my enemy your friend. So, people who would normally be very anti-Amazon because they are this insanely powerful giant company with massive market power, hate Trump, and the Washington Post is one of the two newspapers that\u2019s sort of been most aggressive in exposing Trump. And because Bezos owns the Washington Post, I think he actually gets a huge amount of protection from that. Because he gets credit for that. He has a team of investigative journalists who can be helpful. If I were Zuckerberg, I would be looking to buy every newspaper I could right now.\u201cLet me buy the New York Times.\u201d It\u2019s not for sale.It doesn\u2019t matter now much it makes or loses. It\u2019s not the point.He\u2019s not that smart. Bezos is brilliant.I mean, if anyone understood that on the front end, it was probably him.And he doesn\u2019t say much, either, that\u2019s the ...That\u2019s even smarter.You know what I mean, he stays away and he doesn\u2019t engage and he doesn\u2019t appear.Yeah. And he doesn\u2019t have nearly as many political problems.I\u2019m amazed he hasn\u2019t been summoned to Congress. But he hasn\u2019t.Not yet.Not yet. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if he does. I don\u2019t think they, Democrats are-If he does, I bet he will handle it reasonably well. Like everything he\u2019s done-Of course because he\u2019s an actual adult. Yeah, everything he\u2019s done indicates that he will.So I want to finish up talking about some of these things. I love your headlines. My favorite is, \u201cpick your enemies = win your battles. Strangle the baby in the crib.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what that means, but it sounds like a haiku.It\u2019s actually a chapter about Anthony Weiner, keeping him out of the mayor\u2019s race in 2009.But I like, it sounds like a haiku of politics that I love. But you were talking about the biggest disruption fight of them all. I want to finish on that really quickly. What, politics?So, in my work in politics and tech, I\u2019ve reached three conclusions. One I\u2019ve already mentioned here, which is: I believe all political outputs are driven by the inputs. So every decision a politician makes is solely based on the ability to keep their job and nothing else.Number two, what I learned with Uber and FanDuel and Bird, now, is, if you give people the ability to advocate politically on their phone, they will do so. The same people who would never vote in a primary, probably don\u2019t know what primary day is, are far more likely...By the way, I\u2019ve had them acting on behalf of for-profit companies! Gambling companies, in some cases. But nonetheless, they care about whatever it is-Hacktivism. Hashtag, right?Yeah, and they\u2019re willing to do it. So that\u2019s number two, and then number three is: blockchain, for everything we can tell right now, is dramatically safer than any other way to transmit data from point A to point B. It\u2019s certainly safer than the way elections, I think about campaigns that I ran, like in \u201909 \u2026 I mean, do you know a New York City campaign works, at the end of the day? At 9:00 at night, the polls close, and some poll worker calls into central headquarters in Queens and says, \u201cBloomberg 232, Ferrer 119,\u201d and that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the vote! Right? Could be anything. So the system we have right now-Could be lying.-it\u2019s disaster! So, if you take those three pieces-Ron Wyden talks about this a lot. Yeah, he\u2019s right, so you take the three pieces. It leads to the fact that there may be a way to provide people the ability to vote in elections on their phones over the blockchain. So, what I\u2019m trying to do right now is just gain some proof of concept. So, West Virginia was the first state to do it. They did it in their primary in May, they\u2019re doing it again in their general election now. It\u2019s for deployed military.The Republicans aren\u2019t going to like this, because poor people have phones.What\u2019s interesting is in this case, to his great credit, the Secretary of State of West Virginia is a Republican. He was in the military, all four of his kids were in the military. And he was offended by the notion of these people who are putting their lives on the line for our right to vote, their votes never count, right? If you mail it from Kandahar, it\u2019s like a month later. So, we teamed up together. I paid for the costs for the state to administer the election, so we avoided all the RFP-type issues. And it\u2019s expanded from two counties in the primary to 24 counties in the general. We\u2019re now talking to lots of different states. Seems like Colorado is the most likely next candidate to do municipal elections next year. And my hope is over the next couple of years, is to prove this thing can work. I\u2019m not an investor in any of the underlying companies because I want to not care who wins, right? So why is this important to you?Because it\u2019s the only way to fix democracy. Take an assault weapons ban. You\u2019re a Republican Congressman from Florida, turnout is 12 percent in your primary, your district is gerrymandered-Shitty turnout.Yeah. And your district is gerrymandered, so the primary\u2019s the general election. Of that 12 percent, half are NRA members. You probably know intellectually that people toting an AK-47 around your district is not a good idea, but you can\u2019t risk alienating 50 percent of your primary voters. Now, people can vote in that same election on their phone, turnout goes from 12 percent to 60 percent, the NRA\u2019s vote share goes from 50 percent to 10 percent, the politics flip completely. And then it would make no sense to not be for an assault weapons ban. So I don\u2019t think that we can solve any of these issues, because fundamentally, primary turnout is so low-It\u2019s a big idea, Bradley, it is a big idea.Yeah, it\u2019s going to take a long time but, you know-Years are go-Wouldn\u2019t your kids expect to be able to vote in an election on their phone?They should! Everybody should, because poor people can, old people can, they don\u2019t have to drag themselves down to a-Right. Disabled. We\u2019ve got to get it to a place between now and when they\u2019re all voting age, where we\u2019ve proven that it\u2019s completely safe.Right, it was interesting, I was on a program, on Meet the Press, 100 years ago, like five years ago, and I think David Gregory was still there. And I was talking about voting online. I kept saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to vote on our phones. That\u2019s where it\u2019s got to go. There\u2019s got to be some safe.\u201d \u201cOh, we could be hacked.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo no, we\u2019ll figure out a way to do it that, it\u2019s so much safer than a box of ballots or a computer that you can like-\u201dOf course it\u2019s safer. The people who say that have never worked on a campaign.\u201c-a local computer that you can bug with.\u201d And I was like, \u201cit\u2019s gonna be on the phone. There\u2019s going to be some very good way of doing this. It\u2019s not hackable, that it\u2019s not.\u201d And blockchain of course didn\u2019t exist then. And I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to be this way\u201d and, you know, one of the 100-year-old white men on the panel was like, \u201cWell I like going down and putting an x on my paper, and putting my,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen is the last time you put an x on a paper, grampy?\u201d You know what I mean, it was like crazy. It\u2019s like, nobody votes like that. They vote in those machines in the little things. And so, it was sort of this romanticized version of voting, like, one man, one-Don\u2019t you think they also think that maybe only people as erudite as them should be voting in the first place?Yes I do, oh, 100 percent. That was exactly right. They\u2019ve never had a barrier to voting. And other people have. They\u2019ve never had a barrier to anything. Anything, and so they don\u2019t understand. Even my own kids I\u2019m like, \u201cDo you know other people struggle? I just don\u2019t know if you understand that you live in a bubble of white guy.\u201d And so in my kid\u2019s case, total white guy, tall white guy with blue eyes! It just goes on and on and on for them, which is really, they just get more and more advantages as they go along. But what was interesting, so I was talking about this, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to vote online someday. We\u2019re just going to vote online.\u201d So I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t care, all your romantic, we\u2019re just going to vote online someday so poor people can vote, old people can vote, people who can\u2019t get to the polls. Everyone will vote then, because it\u2019s easy.\u201d I said, \u201cpeople call Ubers, they call, I said, Tinder. Tinder really works. And someone goes, \u201cand really is good, you can match people so quickly and it\u2019s how we should do everything every government service should be using these commercial technologies.\u201d And one of the people on the show goes, \u201cYou\u2019re comparing voting to Tinder?\u201d Like that. And I go, \u201cNo. Tinder works.\u201d Yeah, far more people use Tinder.Tinder\u2019s useful and works and it makes sense!And effective.And effective, and you get what you want by the end of the night. So look, the trick I think is to let the genie out of the bottle. So if you think about our Uber conversation earlier, we knew that once we exposed people to markets, this new service that was so much better than taxi, they\u2019d fight for it because they didn\u2019t want to go back to taxi. I think the same thing here. If we show people, hey, look how much easier it is. And they feel like, hey I got to do this thing without having this whole pain in the ass process.Right I\u2019m doing this with you, Bradley, I think it\u2019s critical. I think it\u2019s a critically important issue. I think, voting has to \u2026 You just need to vote. And everything, you\u2019re right, about guns, about all kinds of things, about all kinds. And it\u2019s not just progressive causes, it\u2019s just we will not be the tyranny of four ranchers from Montana deciding our fate.Yeah, special interests on the left or the right. Whatever it is, you should want the mainstream participating.Exactly. Anyway, this is great talking to you, this is a great book. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups From Death By Politics,\u201d it\u2019s by Bradley Tusk, and he is a fixer, for sure.
