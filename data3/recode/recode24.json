{"id": "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki says \u2018one of our biggest competitors\u2019 is fake science on sites like Goop", "paragraph": "Unlike many Silicon Valley CEOs, 23andMe\u2019s Anne Wojcicki is constantly reminding her employees of an uncomfortable truth: \u201cWe mess with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cYou tell someone that they\u2019re a carrier for BRCA, or you tell someone, \u2018You\u2019re a high risk for blood clots.\u2019 Or you tell someone that you\u2019re one-64th Native American,\u201d Wojcicki said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. \u201cAnd it has real consequences on their life. And so we\u2019re messing with people\u2019s identity. And it\u2019s really important that we take that seriously.\u201dThe DNA-testing service has been working its way through FDA regulations since 2013, which Wojcicki said was \u201cfrustrating\u201d but understandable. She told Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher that others in the health and science world \u2014 such as Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s wellness site Goop \u2014 have evaded those same controls and are spreading bad info.\u201cOne of our biggest competitors in this space of science is Goop health and Gwyneth Paltrow because she has such pull,\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201cBut some of the things that she promotes don\u2019t actually have the scientific validity that my team would be able to stand behind.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that we think about with 23andMe is just promoting scientific literacy, because it\u2019s important for people to know what is real and what is not real,\u201d she added. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s actually the same issue that you have right now in news. How do you discern what\u2019s actually real and what\u2019s not?\u201dYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Anne, which was recorded in front of a live audience at the Rock Health Summit in San Francisco.Kara Swisher: So, we have a lot of things to talk about. Obviously, Anne and I have known each other forever.Anne Wojcicki: A long time.Long time, before when she was a healthcare analyst.Yeah, yeah.And so we\u2019re going to talk about 23andMe, but I think it\u2019s remiss of me not to talk about the current news with Elizabeth Warren and testing. And so I wanted to sort of get Anne\u2019s reaction ... come on, come on. People are going to learn a lot about genetic testing in this period, I think.So let\u2019s talk about this. This is like, you know, you guys have gotten a lot of attention and different things, but this sort of brings a huge focus onto people\u2019s genealogy. Yeah. No, I mean, I think it\u2019s the sense of identity and where people are from, is definitely a hot topic. We have this new podcast episode that specifically talks about race and the definition of race and how it\u2019s being redefined. And years ago \u2014 probably four or five years ago \u2014 I spoke at the National Association of Reform Rabbis, and I presented them, \u201cHey, here\u2019s all the different results people are getting.\u201d People find out they\u2019re 5 percent Jewish, 10 percent Jewish, 15 percent Jewish, and they\u2019re walking into synagogues and are like, \u2018We want to join, we\u2019re part of the tribe.\u2019\u201d And it\u2019s kind of similar in this case, like what is that definition? What\u2019s the definition of being Jewish?Right.And what\u2019s the definition of saying, \u201cI have Native American ancestry\u201d? Or African ancestry. So without a doubt, the thing that\u2019s amazing to me is the science of your genetic ancestry is really good. And so you get, in the fringes, it\u2019s going to keep refining over time. I always say it\u2019s kind of like Google Earth in the old days: It\u2019s a little bit fuzzy, but over time, it refines and it refines, and especially as the databases are getting bigger and there\u2019s more and more populations. So I believe ... I know Carlos Bustamante, who did the analysis, he\u2019s well known specifically for this, he\u2019s an adviser to us, he\u2019s an adviser to ...Just to be clear, Donald Trump said he was a bogus ...He kind of was like, \u201cYeah these are fake tests, whatever. This is like ...\u201d, and I was like, \u201cWell it\u2019s ironic \u2018cause we\u2019re spending all this time going through the FDA and showing just how legitimate genetic testing is.\u201d And so on the ancestry part, it\u2019s one thing that I remember even when I got my results, how shocking it was to see. My father\u2019s Catholic, my mother\u2019s Jewish. And my DNA comes back, \u201cWow, you\u2019re 50 percent Jewish.\u201d So it is remarkable how, I think, how ...Well, wouldn\u2019t you know that from your mother\u2019s Jewish ...Well I did, but it was interesting to see it based on, it was interesting to see it in my DNA.I\u2019m not a scientist, but ...But I think that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting, is when you see something that\u2019s so obvious to you, but it actually manifests in your DNA.Right. You know what I found out?What?I was Jewish.Oh!And African.Okay.And Arabic.Yeah.Everything was in there. It was fascinating. Oh, interesting.And so one thing I did, and my mother was even more so, \u2018cause I guess we were in southern Italy, so it makes a lot of sense when you start to think about those things. And also my other side of the family\u2019s from the south. So you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s all coming in. And I called my ... I have two brothers, and one lives here in Marin and is totally normal. The other is in Pennsylvania and he\u2019s what you\u2019d imagine a Trump person from Pennsylvania would be like. And so he\u2019s, I would say, vaguely racist. And so I called him up, and I said, \u201cHey brother.\u201d And he goes, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I go, \u201cNo, you\u2019re African-American.\u201d And I said, \u201cNow you can hate yourself.\u201dYeah.\u2019Cause he\u2019s so offensive. But it was a really interesting, it was really fun. I really appreciated that time I spent on 23andMe, just to get that.One of my favorite stories ever is, ironically, written by People magazine. And it\u2019s a story of this man who had a one-night stand with this woman; he\u2019s part of the KKK, he was a child of a Grand Klansman. He had a one-night stand with this woman who was Jewish. She then went on to have, they had a child. Went on then to have biracial children with someone who\u2019s African American, someone who\u2019s Latino. So this man, who\u2019s part of the KKK, finds through 23andMe that he actually has these African American, mixed-race children. And they meet. It\u2019s a well written story, \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t say, \u201cOh it was all lovely, roses, and everything changed.\u201d But it was like, \u201cI realize I have to reevaluate my position, and it\u2019s not easy. I have a history of hating.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cDo I love that I have this African American son-in-law? It wasn\u2019t what I would have chosen, but I\u2019m learning that I have, I have to re-evaluate.\u201dBut in this, I just want to get through this news. In this situation it\u2019s being used for not-nice things. Yeah.It was initially used, for some reason she did this, and then Trump responded and kept calling her \u201cPocahontas.\u201d And then she responded. And she was trying to do this in response to that.Right. What does that do to this idea of genetics? \u2018Cause now it becomes sort of a clown show, in terms of how you treat it. How do you look at this, when this news thing pops up and you\u2019re one of the companies that is doing this as a business?I think there\u2019s a lot ... I think that it\u2019s hard to battle fake news. And I think the only way you battle fake news is actually just with data. And I think that\u2019s where, again, I\u2019m proud of Carlos Bustamante who\u2019s at Stanford, who\u2019s the one who did the analysis, who\u2019s led a lot of this work. Is that there\u2019s data behind it. So in some ways, I haven\u2019t worried that much about this because I think that there\u2019s data behind it, that supports the validity of somebody gets something that says, \u201cYou have a great-great grandparent who is of Native American ancestry.\u201d I think that there\u2019s good scientific explanations for it. And it think that in this day and age, one thing I say, I often say, one of our biggest competitors in this space of science is Goop health and Gwyneth Paltrow because she has such pull. But some of the things that she promotes don\u2019t actually have the scientific validity that my team would be able to stand behind. And so I think in this world we\u2019re seeing all kinds of fake news and fake reports of health, but I think that\u2019s where the only thing that we can do is help educate customers about what is real science. And making sure that we\u2019re only promoting real science. It\u2019s part of where we have a very strict standard about what we give back to people.But you consider Gwyneth Paltrow a competitor. Really, why?Not a competitor in ...Only because they, I don\u2019t feel like people who advocate jade in your vagina is a competitor, but that\u2019s ...I think it\u2019s more about when I think about what people are doing, their engagement in health.I see, okay.Their interest in wellness.Right.They often, like you look at her site traffic. Her site traffic or the site traffic to the CDC, which is like ... Think about the publicity around the anti-vaccine movement, and their site traffic versus the site traffic to, again, people who are promoting, \u201cThis is what the vaccine schedule should be.\u201d So my point more is that there is a lot of people who are able to promote faux science, and I think that that is actually an issue. And part of one of the things that we think about with 23andMe is just promoting scientific literacy, because it\u2019s important for people to know what is real and what is not real. In some ways, it\u2019s actually the same issue that you have right now in news. How do you discern what\u2019s actually real and what\u2019s not?So let\u2019s talk about where the company is and where the area is. Because there\u2019s been a lot of changes. You\u2019ve been working with the FDA ... where do you stand? You\u2019re getting more and more tests. So talk about an update of where you are.We keep working with the FDA on different approval processes. So we recently got the breast cancer approval. So that\u2019s the most recent one, and it was important for us to bring that back because a lot of people \u2014 like I mentioned \u2014 don\u2019t know that they have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. So, making sure that if you find out, for instance, that you might be a carrier for one of these genetic variants, but you didn\u2019t know that you had Ashkenazi background, you could potentially develop breast cancer early in your 40s. So again, it\u2019s been really important for me to bring that back.These are things you had initially on 23 ... I have the original one. Yeah. We did the original one.Yeah, you did.I had lots of the information and I kept it. I actually printed it all out. So I had it, and then it was removed from ...Well, you still get the PDF.Right, right, right, exactly. So but you\u2019ve added breast cancer, and then?We have breast cancer. We added the ones like Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 the genetic health risks, we call them. And the first approval we got was carrier status in things like cystic fibrosis. And the one that we\u2019re still, that we talk about, that used to be in the old product but we don\u2019t have back yet, is drug testing. So pharmacogenetics. So whether or not you are likely to respond to a medication. Whether you\u2019re going to be a fast metabolizer or a slow metabolizer. Should you take more of a drug medication or less of that? So that\u2019s one of the ones that we\u2019re still, that we used to have, that we often talk about that we would like to come back.Now, Silicon Valley has often been at odds with the FDA. How do you look at the FDA now? How do you look at their processes? Who is ... The running of the FDA. How has it been under the Trump administration?So Scott Gottlieb is the commissioner.He\u2019s not like a real estate agent, right?He\u2019s not. Okay, all right. No, the deputy CTO of America was a real estate agent, but go ahead.Scott\u2019s actually ...I\u2019m not kidding.I have a lot of respect for Scott. Scott\u2019s spent a lot of time in Silicon Valley, so he actually understands, he was a partner for a while at a VC fund. He was in past administrations in the FDA, so I think he actually really knows what he\u2019s doing. And I think he really wants to do the right thing. And I think that sometimes it\u2019s hard. I admire just running a 600-person company. I admire him because trying to shift such a large organization is hard. So, I think he\u2019s making progress in important areas.In what ... What\u2019s progress from your point of view?Well for us, we\u2019re kind of in a ... it\u2019s interesting to note that of all the sort of more direct-to-consumer companies out there, we\u2019re the only ones who\u2019ve gone through the FDA process. So it is a, again, we\u2019re really proud of pioneering a direct-to-consumer path, and we\u2019re really proud of actually, we\u2019re the only ones out there that don\u2019t require a physician\u2019s oversight or a prescription. That said, it\u2019s a hard path. And there\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s not ... no one else is necessarily following it, is actually a hard path. So I would stay it\u2019s still, I think there\u2019s pros and cons of being regulated. It\u2019s definitely, it\u2019s taken a lot of time, and it takes a lot of money. That said, the one thing I\u2019ve learned over the last 12 years is \u2014 and I tell this thing to employees all the time \u2014 is that we mess with people\u2019s lives. You tell someone that they\u2019re a carrier for BRCA; or you tell someone, \u201cYou\u2019re a high risk for blood clots.\u201d Or you tell someone that you\u2019re one-64th Native American. And it has real consequences on their life. And so we\u2019re messing with people\u2019s identity. And it\u2019s really important that we take that seriously. So I understand the need for regulation, and I think the thing that\u2019s been frustrating, there\u2019s a lot of groups out there that there\u2019s ways to sort of circumvent it. And I think that that\u2019s where I worry more. And again, I bring up things like Goop health and others, there\u2019s all kinds of ways to propagate not the most ideal data.Some of them got slapped back. Goop got slapped back. I know there was a lot of ...Goop did. But think in genetic testing, there\u2019s still a fair number of groups out there that can interpret DNA, and it causes me anxiety that people will get wrong interpretations.Right. So when you look at what you want from this FDA, what do you want? What do you want to have happen?Specifically-\u2018Cause Silicon Valley has always been pressing on the FDA in kind of a juvenile way-I think it\u2019s ... I\u2019m impressed. Like Apple got their Watch approved pretty quickly. I\u2019m impressed always with AliveCor. That\u2019s when it tells you that it does EKGs. My father\u2019s used that device. We\u2019d be on the beach and he\u2019d be like, \u201cOh wow. I\u2019m in atrial fib.\u201dThis is heart, correct, this is cardial? Yeah. It tells you whether you\u2019re in atrial fib. So I think that it\u2019s one of those things. I think that Silicon Valley in some ways has a responsibility to be aggressive, and to go forward to the FDA. I worry there\u2019s a lot of companies that I meet with, and people come and get advice all the time; and I worry often that people are doing what they can to circumvent the FDA, and I think that that actually worries me because one of the things that you do need to do, is with regulators, you have to keep them informed about what is happening. \u2018Cause that\u2019s how they get educated. And we saw the consequences with Theranos for something that\u2019s not regulated. That again, you mess with, you can really impact people\u2019s lives. So there\u2019s, again, I have a lot of respect for the FDA because I think that they see a lot of the bad.Well that case appears to be outright fraud.In Theranos?Yeah.Yeah. But it was one of those things. They\u2019re not technically regulated by the FDA. They\u2019re technically regulated by who?They\u2019re regulated by Center for Medicare Services, by CMS, under CLIA. So there\u2019s, it\u2019s a softer regulatory path. So in that capacity they were able to actually get onto the market without the same kind of oversight.So how much did Theranos set back companies like yours? There\u2019s been a lot. There\u2019s been AliveCor, there\u2019s Color, there\u2019s, these are the consumer-facing ones.I think because the Theranos case was so extreme that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily had a negative consequence. I think that people are more aware. In some ways it\u2019s been helpful; that people are more aware of scientific fraud. Scientists always say, \u201cJust because something\u2019s published in Nature or something\u2019s in Science doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\u201d But my mom would say, \u201cOh of course it\u2019s true. It was published in that.\u201d So I think it\u2019s been a helpful example for people to realize in some ways that not everything that\u2019s out there is actually real. And there\u2019s a number of companies that don\u2019t necessarily go through a real regulatory or a real data science process, and I think that\u2019s actually been a helpful eye-opener for customers in some ways. So talk about the consumer-facing business because it\u2019s a struggle. You\u2019re trying to sell tests, but ultimately, you have to have something else to keep people there.Well the consumer business, we\u2019ve really, the last couple years, especially after we got our first FDA approval or authorizations, the market is there. People are definitely interested in their genetics. They\u2019re interested in the sense of identity. And a lot of it is that the ancestry market really exploded first. And in part because there\u2019s more competition on the ancestry market. But people really are interested in a sense of identity. And I think that that\u2019s where there\u2019s a big gap that\u2019s out there, where people would like to feel connected in a different way. And there\u2019s interesting conversations about what\u2019s actually the definition of family? Is it necessarily the people you\u2019ve grown up with, or is it the people that you are genetically related to? What is that definition of family? So that\u2019s at that health side, is where I think there\u2019s, in many ways, the most potential. People are hungry for ways and information about how to live healthier. And in some ways, people still are figuring out what to do with information and actually, frankly, how to be in charge of themselves. Most people don\u2019t really take ownership of their health. They go to the physician periodically, they kind of watch what they eat, their exercise, I think a lot is changing with the watches that\u2019s coming out. But that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re hoping, to inspire people more and more. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou are that center of your health, and the more you take charge of yourself, the healthier you can be.\u201d So I think that that\u2019s ... you will see us have a much bigger focus on health in the coming months.Health, that you\u2019re giving them, and ...Just about, well yeah, in terms of what you can actually do to help prevent ... you know, if you\u2019re at higher risk for blood clots, what is it that you could do? If you have African ancestry, are you potentially at higher risk for sickle cell? So things like that, like giving people ... and then helping people know what are some of the actions that you could take next.But you don\u2019t have a physician ... a lot of these others you talk about do have physician elements, like Color does, there\u2019s another one ... they come into my office periodically, have different parts of that. They\u2019re often physician-oriented.Well, they\u2019re physician-ordered, but they don\u2019t necessarily have a physician interface. Mm-hmm. Many of them do recently, I\u2019ve noticed, a lot of them do, where it goes to the physician and ...It goes to the physician, right.Right.And that\u2019s because it\u2019s under Medicare, it\u2019s required to.Right, I see. But where does ... what I\u2019m talking about is where the business goes next, is that you give them health advice that you ... I\u2019m trying to grok where your business ...I think that having more and more of a robust health product in terms of like, again, getting the drug reports coming back. So I think that we look at when we can get pharmacogenetics back, it\u2019s kind of like the complete product is back. And then it\u2019s about helping people have the utility, of what do you do next with that? One of the things that we had before the FDA were some of these journeys of, you know, like you\u2019re going into surgery, what are some of the questions for you to think about? And helping people synthesize some of that information. So I think that\u2019s more and more the direction, is that people want to put all those pieces together, and then put that together in the story. And so, again, the world is exploding with the watches and your phones, and the information that you can pull about helping people say, \u201cThis is what your genetic risk factors are, this is the information that you\u2019ve given us about how you\u2019re living your life. This is actually how much you\u2019re walking every day, how much you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d Can we actually then have predictions for you? So I think pulling together more and more of that data, and giving you better predictions, or coaching.Let\u2019s get the privacy ... we\u2019re going to get questions from ... we have a whole bunch, I see them popping here. The topic of ... let\u2019s get to privacy first, then I want to answer the question of what the topic of this, the evolution. Sort of, you\u2019ve had an up-and-down trajectory, essentially. But one of the issues around you all is privacy in what you do. You signed a lot more deals to give information. Now ...Well, we never give out your individual level ...I get that. But I think people are on a, like a ... you\u2019re familiar with the Google people?Yeah, heard of them, yeah.Yeah, exactly. There\u2019s been a hack there, at Google Plus, which nobody uses, fine. Except for Sergey.Except for Sergey ... does he still?Sometimes.You know he does, you\u2019re right. I always thought of Google Plus as a social media service for antisocial people. It\u2019s true, right? You see what I\u2019m saying. You got it.We are going ...You got it completely. You have the Google hack, you have the Facebook hack, you\u2019ve got the privacy issues, you\u2019ve got a privacy bill in California around things like this. You have enormous amounts of important information. And as people input more or use your health things ... can you talk about that? Because, honestly, I think that this techlash against technology is well deserved. Tell exactly what you\u2019re doing and how you\u2019re thinking about it.I think what\u2019s interesting, because we\u2019re doing technically human subjects research, we have an institutional review board, we have an IRB, that oversees the research.Which is important.Which is actually really different. Like, Google doesn\u2019t have an IRB. Facebook doesn\u2019t have an IRB. There\u2019s no outside group necessarily overseeing how you\u2019re using the data you collected.Not yet.Not yet, not yet. But in some ways that was a helpful process for us in those early days of like, really ... the first year that we spent setting up the company, we spent a long time, not necessarily just developing the product but just thinking through specifically privacy and consent, and how are we going to do this in a way that can scale online, that protects, that actually creates more of a balance ...To be anticipating the consequences.Yeah. Like things like the Golden State Killer. It was actually something that we thought of. We specifically said, one, we don\u2019t allow people to take other samples and upload them into 23andMe and compare it against all the data set. And we don\u2019t do that, because in part, we thought about that in the early days. Like that other ...Hey, one day people might take random DNA samples and upload them there. So I\u2019m actually really ...Another company did, though.Well, it\u2019s actually a public dataset, it\u2019s Jedcom. And it\u2019s not necessarily against their terms of service, they ... if you want to do that. And I think that\u2019s part of ... The most important for me is just making sure people are aware. One of my favorite quotes from the Henrietta Lacks movie was that she said, \u201cI would have been happy to consent for research. I just want to know that I was consenting.\u201d And I think that\u2019s a big part, is that people don\u2019t necessarily want their data not to be used, they just want the dignity of knowing that it is being used and how is it being used. So we ask our customers, \u201cDo you want to consent over research?\u201d Over 80 percent of our customers do. At any time, if you decide you no longer want to be part of research, you can opt out, you can say, \u201cI no longer, I\u2019m withdrawing my consent.\u201d If I send you a survey on Crohn\u2019s disease, and you say, \u201cThat\u2019s not interesting to me,\u201d [if] you don\u2019t take it, then I can\u2019t use your data on that. If I send you a survey on migraines and you use it, well then we\u2019re using it. But we keep you reminded at the top. So for me, it\u2019s always been about not giving people that opportunity, but just making it really clear that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. I think that that\u2019s like the main thing. In some ways like GDPR, I feel I tried to do that, like, \u201cFYI, you have these cookies, this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d But that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve tried to do, is make sure people are aware of what we\u2019re doing.And what about the safety of the data? Because that\u2019s the other part. Because, even if you do things just right on consents, that\u2019s only opt-in essentially, that\u2019s a definite opt-in. Even if that\u2019s allowed, and I just recently wrote in the Times about the internet bill of rights, and it\u2019s sort of a grab bag of things. And among those is opt-in. But the other one is, what happens to the data, third parties? And that was what happened, this sort of hurricane Cambridge Analytica, and then it was hurricane Russians and hurricane ...So, we don\u2019t give ... we ask people, most of the BD deals we do, we base on aggregate data, it\u2019s not individual-level data. So for instance, if we were doing a study on, again, on migraines, and we are working with Pfizer, we\u2019re going to give them aggregate data. So we\u2019ll give them the analysis of the results. There are definitely some cases where we re-consent people so that we can give them data back, and we\u2019ve now allowed people the option. There\u2019s some people who just say, \u201cYou know what? Use my data for anything you want.\u201d And so there\u2019s people who have another layer of consent and they\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m happy for you to do whatever you want with the data.\u201d So, most of the analysis we do with partners is based on aggregate data.You say most, you just said most, what isn\u2019t?That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, in this specific example. So for instance, in Parkinson\u2019s Disease, we will consent people for individual-level data, so that data could be shared with Michael J. Fox.Okay, through his ... so that they can use it ...But it\u2019s an additional layer of consent. The majority of our research I\u2019d say is aggregate data, some data, but again, that\u2019s where you\u2019re explicitly consenting again for individual-level data use.And what about the protection of the data within your walls?I mean, that\u2019s where we spend ... again, I often say like banks have a lot, like banks pioneer a lot of data security. Your genetic information is really interesting, but your bank account is much more interesting. There\u2019s a lot that we can learn from that sector. So we do everything we can. It\u2019s been a high priority ... like, we have pretty robust now, security team. We\u2019re building that out even more. But it\u2019s been a really high priority for us since Day One. And I\u2019m grateful to my early engineers, and that we had people who came from PayPal and came from banking, who were really focused on data privacy and security. So we do everything we can to make sure we\u2019re building out the infrastructure. Structurally we also do things like we keep your identifying information in a separate dataset from your genetic information. So those two databases don\u2019t speak, unless by a very few number of people. So we structurally tried to set it up to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can to protect your privacy.What\u2019s your nightmare scenario here? Because I think like, I do Clear, right, I did Clear and they\u2019ve got my eyeball, whatever, they\u2019ve got my fingerprints, they\u2019ve got my eyeballs. And I just think, \u201cYou know what? They\u2019re going to come get me someday.\u201d They just clearly are ... between my tweets and my genetic information, I\u2019m screwed.You know, I think that the ...I\u2019m going right to that camp in \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d I\u2019m going right there. You can only watch that first episode, it was awful.I couldn\u2019t watch this season. It\u2019s too real.I think that the privacy issues I find for 23andMe are mostly within a family. And it might be, since you talk about your family, let\u2019s say your brother really did not want to know his genetic ancestry, and then you told him. What you just did. So, did you violate his privacy?I don\u2019t care.And so, that is exactly what most people say. So I think those types of situations come up where ...I\u2019m in jail for that every day of the week.... where you find that people, you get this disconnect in families about whether or not people want to know. And we find this ... One of the most interesting things is, you often find children will come in and say, \u201cOh we want to do 23andMe,\u201d and then one of the parents doesn\u2019t want to. And they clearly know there\u2019s a reason why. And then the siblings find out, like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re half siblings.\u201d Right, oh yeah. I saw that John Sayles movie.That happened. So that happens a lot. And we\u2019ve had other privacy ... the other privacy issues we have ...Maybe someone in the audience has a story like that.I\u2019m sure, well, I mean it\u2019s roughly 10 percent of the population, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably, could be a support group in here. We get those, I worry more about those. I think a lot about ... I worry more about the holistic economy. Like, I do spend a lot of time just making sure that we are really on top of privacy. Because to your point, we\u2019re lumped in with Silicon Valley ...You are.... like we\u2019re part of it. And there is a real ... I worry about the backlash that\u2019s potentially coming our way. And it almost feels like a tsunami, like we\u2019re just in that...Well it is getting lumped in, and they\u2019re very differentiated. I mean, there\u2019s a difference between Apple and Google. There\u2019s a difference between Facebook and everybody else. But they get pulled in. I had someone ... you know, you have people from other companies now, who are not affiliated like that going, \u201cDamn Facebook,\u201d I mean, they really are angry because of all the regulation coming this way, it\u2019s because of behavior at Facebook and Google essentially. Right.Right. So what do you do about that?I think that\u2019s where we try to make sure that we stay somewhat differentiated. The one thing I\u2019m really proud of for our customers, is our customers trust us, to an extent. Like it\u2019s, I think we\u2019ve shown to our customers we\u2019re really protective of how we use the information, what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019ve proven out for years. We do research for all the right reasons. We publish, we have over 120 publications. We really try to do the right thing. And I think in some ways with the FDA coming after us in 2013 and really sticking to our guns and coming back, I think it\u2019s won over a lot of loyalty from our customers. So I think that the most important thing we can do, like I\u2019m really protective of our customer and the brand. And I emphasize to people every day, like, our customers, you the individual, it\u2019s not pharma, it\u2019s not others, like it\u2019s you ...Yeah, that\u2019s a business.It\u2019s a business, but ultimately ...How big a business is that part? Selling other people\u2019s data?But we never sell people\u2019s data.All right, okay. All right, listen, Mark Zuckerberg ...Hey. But we don\u2019t sell people\u2019s data, it\u2019s a lot about ...That\u2019s a Mark Zuckerberg answer, I\u2019m sorry. \u201cWe never sell data.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, you just mash it up and sell the insights back to people.\u201d It\u2019s the same thing.Well, okay. I mean, yeah, we, but it\u2019s always under the ... it\u2019s a research partnership.But it\u2019s a revenue stream for you, right?It\u2019s a revenue stream for us. But it\u2019s also about ... like one thing I have found is that our customers who have an illness really want to participate. So for instance, we\u2019re doing a lot more clinical trial recruiting. In part because it\u2019s a need for the pharma companies, but it\u2019s also a real need for customers, customers who have a disease. Somebody wrote me yesterday saying, \u201cI have early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and there\u2019s nothing for me to do.\u201d I was like, \u201cThere are things for you to do.\u201d So matching people up is a real service there. We do a lot of research programs with academics and with pharma companies. But more and more what we found is that business line, in some ways, it\u2019s definitely a business for us, but it\u2019s slow, and it\u2019s not huge. So that\u2019s part of the reason why we invest in it and we\u2019re doing our own drug discovery. So we have 13 drugs on our own that we\u2019ve ... you know, we hired Richard Scheller, who came from Genentech, and we\u2019re pursuing that, in part, because we feel like that\u2019s ... again, our mission is about people being able to access, understand and benefit from the human genome. When you think about, \u201cHow are you really going to benefit?\u201d It\u2019s that, \u201cI\u2019m going to succeed at keeping you healthy at 100. And I\u2019m either going to keep you healthy at 100 by helping you really know what to do,\u201d so like I said, the consumer product, the action plan, like, \u201cWhat can I do to help you be healthier?\u201d Or if you do have a disease, can we actually develop a therapy that really helps you benefit and that really could cure you?Right. I\u2019m going to get questions from the audience. But what do you think of all these... I recently had a meeting with a ton of Silicon Valley people on this anti-aging thing, and I\u2019m not talking about only lotions. Oh.When you say, \u201coh\u201d \u2026 Oh, that person. Well, you know but, there\u2019s a couple ... you know that there\u2019s VCs involved, there\u2019s all kinds of things. And it has to do with longevity. It\u2019s not anti-death, I think that\u2019s sort of a miss ... it\u2019s like not ... it\u2019s dying at 500, or not being sick when you\u2019re 100 and being very healthy at 100, kind of thing. How do you look at that? I mean, that\u2019s sort of in your ...I think it is. I mean, I look at being healthy at 100. I feel like we have a long ways to go even to aspire for that. You know, and in some ways, like they\u2019re some of the most basic aspects, as you know, understanding diabetes, obesity and smoking. You know, those three really just have such a massive impact on health on most people here. I\u2019m inspired by genetics, because I think one thing that genetics really can do is help eliminate a lot of early premature deaths. So, BRCA being a good example. You know, people who are high-risk, who potentially die of ovarian or breast cancer ... You could potentially prevent that.Yeah.There\u2019s people with sudden cardiac death. You could potentially really help them know they have that, and then help prevent that. But what do you ... Look at these. Don\u2019t wanna die? Don\u2019t wanna die soon?I haven\u2019t ... You know, we don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time on these individuals. I mean, I think that there\u2019s, without a ... I think Silicon Valley has some of the reputation for the, you know, \u201cWe want to live forever\u201d mentality and helping think that through. I think understanding aging ... Like those mouse studies. You take the young blood and you put it in the old blood? Yeah.I mean, it\u2019s kind of fascinating. I look at my children in a whole new way. My son was so upset when I told him about that. I was like, \u201cI want your blood.\u201dI have no idea why. Oh, man. You\u2019re ...So, I think there\u2019s some ... Aging itself? Scientifically, it\u2019s a really interesting question. We don\u2019t fully understand aging, so I\u2019m a huge fan of understanding that. I know Calico is doing a lot with that. So trying to understand it, I think, is really interesting. But I think that the other pursuits, which I\u2019m not as familiar with, in terms of like, \u201cYes, let\u2019s try to live to 500,\u201d I think there\u2019s a lot of ... Again, it\u2019s a little bit more out there to me.Right, and that\u2019s the thing you\u2019re gonna be ...I just, I\u2019m waiting to see some of the data. Like, who can make me healthy at 100, first? Let\u2019s aspire for that.Right. Well, let\u2019s ask some questions here.Okay.\u201cCan you discuss the monetization of data at 23andMe,\u201d which we just did, \u201cand the partnership with GSK?\u201dMm-hmm.Can you?Yeah. GSK\u2026 So, like I mentioned before, we\u2019re doing these partnerships with pharma partners, and we found that there\u2019s a real hesitancy. A lot of pharma partners just didn\u2019t really buy in to what exactly can you do with genetics? Is that really gonna help with drug discovery? So, we hired Richard Scheller, who came from Genentech. We built up our own drug discovery team. It\u2019s great, it\u2019s been really successful. It\u2019s been surprising how many discoveries we\u2019ve been able to take from concept into development. We now have 13 programs that are in the research stage that we\u2019re making molecules, and in some ways we are almost sinking from our own success. Where, each molecule is expensive. And it\u2019s not like we just focus on multiple sclerosis or Crohn\u2019s. We have a wide variety of diseases that we\u2019re focusing on. As we planned how we\u2019re gonna scale, it became really clear that we need the expertise and the ability to scale that a large pharmaceutical company is going to have.Right.Frankly, we need medical teams across a wide variety of diseases. So, the partnership with GSK, I think, is really ... Or the collaboration, to say ... Is super-exciting, because we can do what we do best, and they can do what they do best, and they\u2019re really gung-ho about genetics and the potential there. Hal Barron, who runs the research team at GSK, used to work with Richard Scheller at Genentech, so we kind of brought the band back together. So there\u2019s a lot of synergy there, and I think there\u2019s a lot of ways for us to be able to accelerate and prove out how people are gonna benefit from the human genome. All right. Next is, \u201cYou talked about cold cases, GEDmatch solving cold cases. Can you speak about that?\u201d Which you did. Which you\u2019re not participating ...Yeah, we\u2019re not part of it. I mean, I think it\u2019s a really interesting issue \u2014 and I think one thing, just to highlight for people, I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize this \u2014 is that your medical samples could be subpoenaed, also, for criminal cases. There was a story out there about a woman whose pap smear was subpoenaed and actually used to solve a crime. So, again, I look at ... I\u2019m a huge fan of transparency. Again, people want to consent, and they want to be part of research for all kinds of reasons. But when I go in to the doctor and I have any kind of procedure, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s just for that procedure. And I find that there\u2019s a whole new world that I\u2019m really focused on. You know, we have GDPR in technology now, or in the internet. Where\u2019s that equivalent in healthcare? Right.And why is it ... Again, you look at Henrietta Lacks and others. Why is it that my healthcare information is circulating all over and I have no access to it?Right. So, the right to be forgotten, really.Right. There\u2019s definitely no right to be forgotten in healthcare. No, not at all. All right. \u201cWho provides your ethical North Star? The board, you, a chief ethicist? Will she or the consumer demand or determine where we draw the line?\u201d Have you thought about having one? I know some companies, tech companies \u2014 I\u2019m gonna be writing about it \u2014 are hiring for that role. For a chief ethicist?Mm-hmm.You know, what\u2019s interesting ... We tried. We had this issue where, in the early days, we interviewed ethicists all over the place and we actually had offers out. And then, every ethicist would engage with us and then they would say, \u201cOh, no. We\u2019ll never speak to you again.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cThis is so exciting. This is a career-making opportunity. We can only talk about you from our ivory tower.\u201d So, we actually couldn\u2019t get an ethicist to join because people found it was such an interesting hot topic.And so, frankly, what I have found is that an opinion of one is not as helpful as us just actively engaging all the time. So, there\u2019s something ... Again, in healthcare, there\u2019s the ethical/legal/social, ELSI group. Joanna Mountain, who is one of the first scientists we hired, was actively involved with the whole ELSI community, and we do a lot. We got the feedback in the early days. Thankful to 23andMe, we generated tons of funding for this community, because there\u2019s suddenly so much interest and discussion in this topic. So, we spend a lot of time thinking about that. I would say now ... There\u2019s me. I have a strong, without a doubt ... I have the mission and I drive for the company, of like, what is our North Star? But I\u2019m really lucky ...Who does that for you?Who does that for me?Yeah.You know, I think ... I think that\u2019s kind of your soul, like how you\u2019re brought up. To me, it\u2019s my family keeps me very grounded. Others. Also, in some ways, being in Silicon Valley, I see for sure what I don\u2019t want to be, and then I\u2019m also reminded of what I do want to be. I think one of the best things to do, especially in this day and age of Silicon Valley, is sometimes ... Like when I worked on Wall Street, I used to volunteer at San Francisco General, and I would just clean gurneys, and I was like a patient advocate. I did it from 11 pm to 6 am. In some ways, having that humility again and keeping staying normal was really helpful, of remembering, like, why are you doing the things that you\u2019re doing, and what is the reality here? So for me ...Man, they\u2019re gonna have to clean a lot of gurneys, these people.Yeah. Oh, no. I mean, the problem is definitely ... But I think it\u2019s keeping ... You know. Part of keeping yourself real in the world of ... Like, I love interacting with our customers because it helps me stay grounded with the mission of the company, and really what is our impact? And it keeps changing over time. \u201cDo you expect 23andMe will ever become a covered benefit, or will it remain self-pay?\u201dSelf-pay. I think people don\u2019t realize that when insurance companies pay for your information, they own it, and I think it\u2019s a really important ... Again, I go through this GDPR. Of, like, where is the GDPR of healthcare? You know. I really question where ... If you want to have privacy? Your insurance company, they pay. They have all kinds of rights to the information. And so, I\u2019m a huge fan ... All kinds of countries outside the United States, there\u2019s just a self-pay option. Healthcare, in my mind, should be affordable. It should be accessible. And I\u2019m a big supporter ... 23andMe, we would be a very different product and we would be a very different company and price point if we were taking reimbursement.Right. Okay. \u201cWhat\u2019s the one lesson you\u2019ve learned since the company\u2019s founding that you wish you knew at the very beginning?\u201d That\u2019s a very nice open-ended question.I think the thing that we missed early on is just how long it takes to educate people about something totally new. I think that we were overly optimistic about the state of scientific literacy in this country. So, the early days, it was really a slog about how are you gonna educate people about genetics and what exactly does it mean and why would you even be interested? You know, we got that question all the time. Like, \u201cWhy do I even care?\u201d And as a group of scientists, it was sort of seen as, it was so obvious. Like, \u201cOf course.\u201d Like, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to look in the mirror? Why would you not want your genetic information?\u201dSo, I think that that was one aspect that we missed early on, was just how hard it is going to be to educate people about why they should want their genetic information. All right. Last two, I\u2019m gonna do together. \u201cSo many male founders in Silicon Valley, and VCs admit preferentially funding them. How do you see your role as a female founder, to raise the tide for female founders?\u201d And then, \u201cHow does 23andMe ensure a diverse population is represented in its data sets shared with pharma, as new drug therapies are developed for all populations?\u201dI\u2019ll take the last one. You have to take both. We spend a lot of time really making sure ... One of the most interesting issues in healthcare is that it is very much biased toward a European population. And 23andMe, even ... You know. We\u2019ll be 75 percent European. Even at that percentage of 25 percent diversity, it\u2019s the largest data sets that are out there in these different populations. So, we do have a number of initiatives going on right now to make sure that we can actually improve the product for different communities, and then make sure that we\u2019re actually selling and that we are giving it away to specific communities as needed.Diversity in research, I think, is one aspect. It\u2019s really poorly understood how much it could benefit everybody, and I think that\u2019s where ... When you think about personalized medicine, I don\u2019t necessarily think about ... You know, people talk a lot about specific drugs. I think about, \u201cWhat is the right blood pressure for you, based on your ancestry, based on everything?\u201d Some of these measurements are just really not well-defined, and I think that\u2019s where we could actually do a lot.Right. They\u2019re well-defined for one group of people.For one group of people. And I think that\u2019s where there\u2019s a lot that we could do, but I think about that. Really understanding the diversity.And then, the female founders?Oh, female. I\u2019m not doing ...You\u2019re a female.I am female. I think it\u2019s important to support. I mean, as more and more ... I have a hard ... I spend a lot of time with my sisters and so I\u2019m kind of surrounded by women all the time. There\u2019s my moments where I\u2019m like, \u201cI really should hang out with more men.\u201d So in some ways, I\u2019ve had that privilege, and I also see how great it is to work in gender-balanced environments. I should do more investing that does really try to encourage women, and when I get those requests, it\u2019s always quite appealing to me. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time doing my own investing right now, because I think it\u2019s just ... It\u2019s a whole other set of projects. But I think it\u2019s really important to do that. And I see just in running the company, for my teams where there\u2019s less diversity ...I think you\u2019re one of the only woman CEOs in the Valley. One of the few. I\u2019m trying to think.I\u2019m one of the few.There\u2019s maybe four. Another one is your sister.Yeah. I know. That\u2019s why we hang out.Right, right. We can\u2019t go by the Wojcicki sisters, the Wojcickis. But really, you and your sister ... Who else is a CEO?We had Marissa.Yeah, but she\u2019s not anymore, so ...I know.Katrina Lake. Yup.There\u2019s not a lot. And it\u2019s really too bad, because I think the diversity makes such a positive difference. It\u2019s so much better when you have a diverse group of people. We had a time period where we had a management team that was entirely women, and we were like, \u201cWe need to hire a man.\u201d We\u2019re very unusual in that way. But it\u2019s in part, diversity really benefits. You see all the biases. I think it\u2019s an issue. So if there\u2019s things that I can do, I should definitely do more of it. I just, it\u2019s been a lot.You\u2019re busy. Last question from me. You\u2019re gonna go public or sell or what?I think that being public ... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any glory in being public. I actually think being public is almost the last-resort option, because you lose all your privacy. You lose so much when you have to be a public company, and then you\u2019re also coming as a public analyst. Like, you have all these people just paid to spy on you, and trying to get ahold of your employees and do all kinds of things. So, there\u2019s no glory. I think that what people always want is, they want liquidity. And there\u2019s all kinds of fabulous new ways these days of actually having liquidity. And I think if we ever do go public, it\u2019s gonna be when we\u2019re a much more mature, stable company.Okay. And sale?Say again, sell? I don\u2019t think ... You know, we don\u2019t fit with anyone. And we\u2019re also in some ways such a rebellious brand that we should stay independent. We need that freedom. So we\u2019re not, we\u2019re definitely not ... No. We\u2019re not selling.All right, then. Thank you, Anne Wojcicki.Thanks so much. Thank you.
