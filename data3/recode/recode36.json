{"id": "Why Airbnb will be worth more than Uber", "paragraph": "Last year, Airbnb raised a $1 billion round that valued it at $31 billion \u2014 a lot of money for a private company, but a distant second to Uber, which this week received proposals that could value the ride-hailing company at as much as $120 billion when it goes public in 2019.On the latest episode of Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, Galloway predicted that that power dynamic will get flipped, and that Airbnb will be the more valuable company in the long run. The reason, he told Swisher, is a \u201cboring economics case\u201d of the moats surrounding each company\u2019s business.\u201cUber has incredible supply, but with $50 million, you and I could start a ride-hailing service in D.C.\u201d Galloway said. \u201cBecause we could create local demand, and local supply.\u201d\u201cAirbnb has to have global demand, because if you\u2019re coming in from Austin, it means you\u2019re not there,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you\u2019re from Copenhagen, you need to have no Airbnb in Copenhagen. Whereas, Uber can have regional competitors everywhere. We\u2019re starting to see that with Didi in China. So, the moats are tiny rivers.\u201dUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said that the company\u2019s long-term vision is to be the \u201cAmazon for transportation,\u201d connecting customers to not just cars, but also trains, buses and more. Galloway proposed an alternate way forward for the company: Become a super-smart travel agency.\u201cI think Uber needs to become Expedia, before Expedia becomes Uber,\u201d he said. \u201cUber should be: All right. I\u2019m headed to Paris next week. I type in Paris. They know my weight class, economically. I put in the date, and I press a button, and it says, \u2018Here is the entire recommended travel itinerary.\u2019 Everything from flights to hotel.\u201dYou can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott\u2019s latest episode.Kara Swisher: Hi everyone. This is Pivot from The Vox Media Podcast Network. I\u2019m Kara Swisher. Scott Galloway:    And I\u2019m Scott Galloway. And here we are face to face in New York City. You know, I\u2019d like to think that you finally decided to invest in this relationship, and that you\u2019re here because of me. It may be about someone else. Is that it? No. No. No. Who are you here to see? Nobody. Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton. You\u2019re literally running to see Hillary Clinton? I am. You have lunch or coffee with her? Yes. I\u2019m going to see her, because we have a big interview tomorrow night at the 92nd Street Y. It\u2019s our third interview. Yeah. It\u2019s a charm. Third time\u2019s a charm. You know who I\u2019m having lunch with? Who? Not Hillary Clinton. No, Mr. Otle. Yeah. Who is that? First name Chip. Okay, who is that? I don\u2019t know, who is that. Chipotle. Come on, that\u2019s not very good. Oh my God! You know what? Hold on. Listen to me. Chipotle, marijuana, Netflix, Cialis ... You need to stop. You need to stop. I was just at Google ...And Vitaminwater, the five food groups. All right here\u2019s the deal. I was just at Google, at the Google News Group, I was giving a speech among a panel thing. I was coming down in the elevator and this guy was like, \u201cI love you and Scott. That Scott guy cracks me up. I like when you riff with him.\u201d Nice. This guy was like a huge fan. One of my dozens and dozens of fans. The second guy listened to it while he works out. It was all guys, it was interesting. Yeah, I\u2019m all bros. But I\u2019m just telling you, we were, two times in one place. It was very exciting. That feels good. Thanks for that. So they like us, they really like us, at Google at least. Big stories this week, let\u2019s go right to them. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, gave an impassioned speech on data privacy in Brussels. He said that Apple supports a federal privacy law in the U.S. Let\u2019s take a listen to some of what he said. Tim Cook: Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency. Every day, billions of dollars change hands, and countless decisions are made on the basis of our likes and dislikes, our friends and families, our relationships and conversations, our wishes and fears, our hopes and dreams. He said he supports a US Federal Privacy Law, which there\u2019s one in California. What do you think? What do you think about this? Important speech? Yeah, well he\u2019s got a ton of moral authority. He\u2019s likable. I think he\u2019s principled, but him taking a stand for privacy, is like Sergey or Sheryl taking a stand against devices that are addictive to the young male brain. It\u2019s just, OK. It\u2019s an attack on Google and Facebook. Yeah, it\u2019s an attack on its competitors. Well, so what? Smart thing to do. Smart thing to do. He\u2019s been doing it for a while. I think it\u2019s principled, but where I think he misses the mark or loses the script, is when a terrorist uses an iPhone, the FBI says, \u201cWe\u2019d like to get into this iPhone to see if other acts of terror are unfolding,\u201d gets a court order and then Apple waves its middle finger in the face of the court order. I\u2019m good with that.Oh, okay. I\u2019m on the other side, you\u2019re wrong. You think the government does any-All right. What if it had been a Blackberry? What if it had been a Blackberry? I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. I like the stance. I like the stance. Okay, one of our kids doesn\u2019t show up after school one day, and with Find Their iPhone, you\u2019re gonna want to know-Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t bring the kids into that. Well, that\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s an emotional reaction. It\u2019s an emotional reaction. Okay. No! No! They should not do that. Guess what, the government has other ways. Should they get search warrants for your house, if your spouse doesn\u2019t show up? That\u2019s what happens. Yes, of course. So your iPhone is more sacred than your house? Yes, but they have made a promise with the user of that phone, get it to the user of that phone, even if it\u2019s ... I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m with Tim on this one. If someone is thrown into the trunk of your Fiesta, they get a search warrant-Oh, no you\u2019re going to do all of these things. ... Hold on. You bought into this religion where Steve Jobs is Jesus Christ and the iPhone is the cross. He\u2019s not Jesus Christ. It is not. Here\u2019s the deal, the government has other ways of catching... If not getting into an iPhone is the only way the government can catch a terrorist-Repository of all information. No it is not. No. It\u2019s called intelligence, it\u2019s called the CIA, it\u2019s called all kinds of ways. They have lots of ways to get this information, and they-So, they shouldn\u2019t get into my home then. They have other ways. This is the part, no. They should get into my laptop. The trade you\u2019re making on this is so big later down the line, that it\u2019s critically important that they have these abilities to encrypt things. I trust judges more than I trust Apple.I do not trust judges. I do not trust our government, which is shown to be ... No. No. Oh no. You\u2019re not one of these deep state people. I\u2019m not a deep state \u2014 oh are you kidding? No. But I do believe he\u2019s right, you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re a hundred percent wrong.I\u2019m used to that. But here\u2019s the deal, this speech on privacy, he did this in an interview with me where I asked him, \u201cWhat would you do if you were Mark Zuckerberg?\u201d He said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in that situation.\u201d Then he went to town on that issue. Yep. He was very good. You did that interview. I did that interview. Yeah. He\u2019s been on this, and Steve Jobs was on this, too. You can look at clips of me and Walt interviewing him, same thing. They\u2019ve been sticking to this for a long time, pre-Google, pre-Facebook, pre-anything like that, so it is a bit of an opportunity for them. Yep. Yep. And it is a religious situation going on in Silicon Valley, the tech-religious. Where people, it\u2019s Apple essentially and Microsoft on one side and some others, who are just furious at Google and Facebook. Then at the Google and Facebook side, they think Tim is sanctimonious, and that he\u2019s lecturing him. Yeah. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m good with him doing that.\u201d Yeah. I think it will be sort of fun if they start going after each other ... Oh they are. We had a little bit of pushback, from Sheryl and from Mark saying it was \u201cextremely glib,\u201d I think they\u2019re all right. In my opinion, Apple has \u2026 it will be interesting to see if Apple holds the same mores around privacy when it comes to their app store, and as they start to get into more complex targeting. They have to be purer than ...But that\u2019s how the world is bifurcating. You\u2019re either wealthy and can afford a device that only pulls on your data 50 times a day, which is iOS, or you want a free phone, and you have a device that gets to pull 1,000 points a day, which is Android. Which is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s argument. Yeah. But I do prefer the first. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing, but that\u2019s how the world is bifurcating. Yes, exactly, where you get to buy privacy, essentially. Well, advertising and targeting, especially advertising, this isn\u2019t a new thing, have become the tax of the poor, and the technologically illiterate have to pay. Yep. It is. I bet the one thing in common with all your media is, it\u2019s not littered with ads telling you, you have restless leg syndrome. Right? You go home on a Thursday night. You can watch Modern Family. You can download it right away on ABC.com. Mm-hmm. Or you can download it and pay three bucks from Apple TV, and most people in our cohort choose, their time is more than 18 bucks an hour, so they download, they pay three bucks for a 21-minute story. So you get the cheaper ones. Let me ask you a question, would you support this U.S. Federal Privacy Law? There\u2019s one in California, obviously Europe has been rather stringent. I think California, once Gavin Newsom gets in power, is going to be its own country. It\u2019s going to pass all kinds of laws. Yeah. It\u2019s the fifth largest economy in the world. I\u2019m in. It\u2019s going to. I think Gavin, that\u2019s the way he\u2019s going. Yeah. What do you think about this U.S. Privacy Law? It makes sense probably to have it done at a federal level, such that companies don\u2019t have to go through the friction of figuring out 50 different legislations. I am not a fan, actually, of regulation. I think the more elegant solution ... I mean, what do we want here? We want to thread the needle between curbing their influence, but at the same time, not kneecapping this incredible machine of capitalism and value creation. I think the way you do that, is by breaking them up. I think this regulation-That\u2019s your go-to thing. Breaking them up, but go ahead. I don\u2019t mind. It works, when has it ever failed? It\u2019s a fair point. The problem with GDPR when you look at Europe is, I worry that it\u2019s actually cementing the position of the leaders. The big ones, yeah. They have them lawyers ... Complexity favors the wealthy and the incumbents. The laws, regulations. This legislation is complex and expensive. There is some basic \u2014 immediately inform people, give people data transparency, give people data mobility. Notify them when they\u2019ve been hacked. Notify them in hack. Those should, I think be law. These people are fighting immunity for too long, at the very least. That makes sense. I think we\u2019re going to get that. I think, especially if the Democrats get into power. I just wrote about this, this internet bill of rights, and that\u2019s one of the top 10. Do you think it should be federal? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yeah. If not, it\u2019s going to be big states like California, Massachusetts, and New York, and it\u2019s going to be federal, essentially. Is it GDPR 1.1, or is there ...No, it\u2019s gotta be more. You can\u2019t have the right to be forgotten here. It\u2019s not going to happen, because of the First Amendment. There will be differences, but it should be enough that, I think the government should sit down with these companies and say, \u201cLook, these are the rules of the road.\u201d Or else, they\u2019re going to lose all their immunity. They\u2019ve had immunity for far too long around these things. Anyway, next thing, Uber. Yeah. What? 120 billion, they\u2019re saying IPO at $120 billion. What do you think of that? Well, first off-There\u2019s a lot of people disputing their ability to make any money. Well, let\u2019s have some fun with this. Okay. I think Uber is an incredible product. Yes, agree. I think it\u2019s amazing. Think about conceptually, you have a multi-trillion asset called Cars, that get 4 percent utilization. Right. So 96 percent of the time, nonutilized, figure out software. It\u2019s literally like, \u201cLet\u2019s come with an app. Let\u2019s you and me leverage the U.S. Navy.\u201d Right. Right. It\u2019s just staggering what they\u2019ve been able to figure out. One of my favorite experiences, and I want to ask you, what is a cool Uber experience you had, I go to the Cannes Creativity Festival. I get off the plane, I pull up the app, I want to see a picture of a car, hit it, and I see an icon of a helicopter come up, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, what the heck?\u201d I press it, and it says, \u201cMeet us at baggage claim.\u201d They zip me off in a sprinter van. I get in this lawnmower with a rotor that looks a kid who\u2019s up from my paper route, with a military uniform, and they fly me across the Cote d\u2019Azur and I land in Cannes. It was for 80 euros. It was just incredible. Yeah. Uber\u2019s changed my life. I love it. So you talk about something you love, and I\u2019ll tell you why I think Uber is ... All right. I\u2019m going to give you my Uber t-shirt, because when I wear it, people throw things at my head. But go ahead. It\u2019s the best t-shirt I have. It\u2019s soft. Well, so you know what\u2019s also a lot of fun? If you\u2019re ever driving up or past a crowded place, just roll your window down and go, \u201cUber!\u201d And see how many people come to the car. It\u2019s a ton of fun, and then look at them like they\u2019re just fucking crazy, \u201cWhy are you bothering me?\u201d Anyway, I think Uber has basically cemented-You\u2019re a sick puppy, but anyway, go ahead. You know it. Go ahead. You know it the most. I do. I\u2019m very aware of the situation, and we have yet to go out for drinks. Okay, so we have a caste system we\u2019re bifurcating into a nation of 350 million serfs, serving 3 million lords, and Uber is the ultimate example of how we\u2019ve institutionalized this. So you\u2019re a lord, presumably? Oh yeah, because I\u2019m fortunate. Because I had access to free education, and had a shaved head. What am I? Am I a Duke? Oh no! You\u2019re the strong man. You\u2019re the one that says, \u201cIt will be done!\u201d And then next thing you know, the person has their head chopped off. All right. I have different thoughts on Uber, just because I\u2019m furious about this Saudi thing, with the money they\u2019ve taken, and the ...Okay, but hold on, and tell me if you disagree with this. All right. 120 billion dollars, that\u2019s a value of-Majority thuggish, murderous, money. What, I\u2019m sorry? That $120 billion IPO, that\u2019s the value of Airbus, couple hundred thousand employees, middle class moms-Yeah, do you think it\u2019s worth that? Well hold on. Give me some running room here, seriously. All right. All right. Okay. Here, I want answers. Then value of Procter & Gamble 180 thousand, more value than the entire auto industry. 12,000 employees. It will be 12,000 people and their investors are splitting 120 billion dollars, so my question is, how have they figured out a way to turn two and a half billion employees into driver partners, which means they don\u2019t get healthcare, they\u2019re not subject to minimum wage laws, they make on average $10.50 an hour, and they have no participation in that 120 billion dollars. My question for Dara is one thing, are you just lipstick on a pig? I like you, I think you\u2019re nice, you\u2019ve calmed down the waters there. But should the two and a half million people that built this company participate in the $120 billion dollar windfall? I agree. Yes. They have to. Someone was just talking about this the other day with me. But are they? No, they\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think they are. They have to. That would be something else. One word, union. Hey Uber \u201cdriver partners,\u201d perhaps you should reach out to the UAW, which by the way, I\u2019m a member of. Oh, the unions have been hollowed out, but move along. Go ahead. Okay, but let\u2019s restore them. If I were these driver partners, I would say, \u201cLook, we need to participate in that $120 billion windfall, or Dara, regardless of how charming and nice you are, we\u2019re going to fuck up this IPO.\u201dAll right, another way you could do it. Again, I\u2019m going back to Gavin Newsom. He was talking about changing the ways employers and contractors, instead of having the old way and we\u2019re judging on those, we create whole new ways of work categories. Right. We require these companies to do things like that, or have healthcare benefits. Again, something they could do in California, which would impact Uber massively. Yeah. That\u2019s Arun Sundararajan, my colleague, he\u2019s done some great work about that. But how does that \u2026 ? So, at one point 25 percent of Sears was owned by the employees. The question is, how do you turn these \u2014 and by the way, if you talk to Uber drivers, fair is fair. They like it. It gives them flexibility. I know that. They have to own a piece of this thing. This is such a thing built by its drivers. Two percent of it. Right. Two point four billion dollars. That would be life changing. Instead of going to the murderous, thuggish Saudis. Two and half million drivers, that\u2019s a thousand-I\u2019m trying to get dismembered here. Bone saw. I feel a bone saw coming our way. I know. Murderous thugs. Anyways, a thousand dollars per driver. Two and a half billion dollars to two percent dilution. You know Dara, pony up. I\u2019m starting to believe you have empathy. All right? Show me. Show us. I\u2019m going to write an entire New York Times column about this, saying this. I\u2019m on your side. Okay. You\u2019ve convinced me of this. I\u2019m in. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth 120 billion dollars. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth 120 billion dollars? No, it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve had lots of economists and me, the breakdown. This is not Amazon. They have no moats. Well, Lyft has come out of nowhere, right? All right, so do you think they have moats? Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cOh, this is like Amazon later.\u201d Do they have ... They don\u2019t seem-No, it\u2019s a very boring economics case of why Airbnb will be worth more than Uber. Because Uber has incredible supply, but you and I could start ... With $50 million, you and I could start a ride hailing service in D.C.Right. Because we could create local demand, and local supply. Right. Local drivers, and local-Right, that\u2019s what I said too. Prices. Airbnb has to have global demand, because if you\u2019re coming in from Austin, it means you\u2019re not there. If you\u2019re from Copenhagen, you need to have no Airbnb in Copenhagen. 100 percent. Whereas, Uber can have regional competitors everywhere. We\u2019re starting to see that with Didi in China. Yep. So, the moats are ... Yep. No moats. They think the brand is a moat, and they act as a moat. ... tiny rivers. Credit card. $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 billion maybe? $120?!Yeah, exactly. Having the credit card is good. What if they start, you go into the subway and then you use your Uber app to pay for it. This is what, and I want to hear what you think, but I think Uber needs to become Expedia, before Expedia becomes Uber. Uber should be: All right. I\u2019m headed to Paris next week. I type in Paris. They know my weight class, economically. I put in the date, and I press a button, and it says, \u201cHere is the entire recommended travel itinerary.\u201d Everything from flights to hotel. It\u2019s a little bit what Airbnb was trying to do, a little bit more experiences.  But go upstream and downstream, right? Yep. Sort of what Google maps does. It tells you how to get there, subway, walking et cetera. I\u2019ve never taken advantage of how much I use Google maps. I have to say, they do offer me restaurants and things, but I don\u2019t avail myself \u2014 it\u2019s not in my face enough. You don\u2019t use it for directions? I use it for directions, but I don\u2019t use it for anything else. I see them offering me things, but it\u2019s not in my face enough. Back to Uber, they are awash in Saudi money? I did not know that. Oh, $14 billion of their... They own a ton of it. They put in $3.5 billion just recently, and before that, they put a bunch in either through PIF or through the SoftBank fund. The SoftBank fund was the latest one, with $9.3 billion, and the Saudi\u2019s represent half of that. My question is the following, what would have them do about that? I don\u2019t know, but here\u2019s what I would not want them to do. So Dara pulled out of the thing. Calls and says, \u201cI\u2019m pulling out of the thing,\u201d which is fine, he obviously had to. But here\u2019s what I didn\u2019t appreciate, when Travis went over there and he\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Kara they\u2019re letting \u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t say that directly, but Uber did this. \u201cHey, Kara, they\u2019re letting women drive now.\u201d And they have movie theaters! And they have movie theaters. I was like, \u201cFuck you! It\u2019s not a favor that women can ... Oh thank you so much sir, for letting women drive!\u201d Then they jailed the woman activist who made that happen. They jailed her for that, so she\u2019s been in jail for years. It\u2019s just, ugh, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know how they sleep at night, taking that money. I just don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t. But here\u2019s the thing, should companies-They can\u2019t give it back. ... There\u2019s no way. And by the way, the Saudis own a lot of Snapchat, they own a lot Twitter, they did through Kingdom Holdings, whoever, and then the high net-worth individuals there, of which there are many. There\u2019s like 150 princes or whatever, however many there are. They\u2019re going to buy this stuff, and they can buy it in the public markets. I\u2019m not good with that. They can buy treasuries, anything else, but anyone who takes money right now from these people going forward, to me is just awful. I hear you. Here\u2019s the problem, as an entrepreneur, I raise a ton of money, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll raise more in the future, you\u2019re willing to disarm, but you\u2019re not willing to disarm unilaterally. Right. The question is, I pay 23 cents on the dollar to the government for them to think long term, and I\u2019m fine not taking their money, as long as my competitors can\u2019t. So I think this is really up to the government to step in and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have money from Saudi into this country. Freeze their asset sanctions.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s like-It\u2019s not gonna happen. They literally killed a journalist, and Donald Trump is talking about, like it\u2019s the media\u2019s fault that the pipe bombs show up at CNN. Oh, I love the most recent excuse. \u201cWe drugged them, and we were going to ask him if he would go back to Saudi Arabia, and if he said no, we were gonna let him go.\u201d They have another one. Now it\u2019s premeditated. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s like the Bill Cosby of geopolitics here. This is not going to come from our government. Literally, the head of our government right now, is saying it\u2019s the media\u2019s fault, for the pipe bombs that were mailed to it. I just don\u2019t even \u2014 I\u2019m in a very angry mode today about that. But again, I\u2019ll press back on you. All right. What do you do? You\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s competitive, you need low cost to capital ... You don\u2019t take the money. ... and you let your competitors take it. You do. And you hope that your consumers-No if you want a soul, you don\u2019t take it. If you don\u2019t want a soul, you take it. So, you\u2019re soulful and unemployed? Look, all the money is dirty in some fashion, but that\u2019s particularly dirty money right now. Yeah, particularly gross. Okay. It\u2019s particularly gross. I\u2019m sorry, I have a soul. Wins and fails. Scott, wins this week? I had terrible wins. My first one was Invisalign. I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but I have these trays in my mouth. Yeah. I used it. I get the sense I\u2019m going to be gorgeous. You\u2019re going to be gorgeous. My dentist, Craig Spodak, is the Tesla of dentistry. You\u2019re doing an ad for Invisalign. They\u2019re not paying us either. What\u2019s the deal? Yeah, all right. I can\u2019t speak or eat, and both of those things got me into trouble, so there\u2019s a lot of benefits to Invisalign. All right. Okay. Win. My real win of the week, and just everyone must know we don\u2019t rehearse, because you\u2019re always like, \u201cI gotta get out of here. I\u2019m having tea with Boutros Boutros-Ghali or something.\u201dNo. I\u2019m, no. So, anyways, my win of the week ... I think he died, but okay. But other than that, he\u2019s doing really well. Okay. Other than that, he\u2019s just fine. My win of the week is, I\u2019ve been thinking about this probably too much, I\u2019m going to get you out of the Fiesta. You and I are going car shopping. What? I figured out the car for you. What? Okay. The scooter, Skip scooter. No, no, no. I\u2019m going to scooter. It\u2019s a two thousand ... We\u2019re going to the dealership. No, I\u2019m not getting another car. It\u2019s a 2011 matte black Porsche 911. No. Oh my God! Okay, hold on. Hold on. You fit all the criteria for a Porsche perfectly. Can I just tell you, just because you think I\u2019m a lesbian, you think I like a man car? No. No. No. Lesbian wasn\u2019t even going to come into it. You fit all the criteria. All right. Tell me. You want to hear the criteria for driving a Porsche? Okay. Okay. The first is, you\u2019re shorter than 5\u201910. All right. Yes. You have to be short to drive, or short-ish to drive. Okay. I get into a Porsche, and I look like a Q-tip behind a German automobile. You have great hair. Anyone in a Porsche should have great hair. I do have great hair. I do. You have great hair. Okay, so you\u2019re bought in on that one. All right? All right. You have money, right? Yeah. Most people who drive Porsches have really little penises, so having no penis qualifies. All right. All right. You know, Scott, we\u2019re stopping. So sunglasses, great hair, rich, short. Boom! Porsche, there is no substitute. All right Scott. We\u2019re going to get into other issues. I\u2019m stopping you. If Nazi\u2019s can build rockets, they build great sports cars. No, no, no, no. N to the O. I\u2019m never buying another car again. Oh come on. Come on. I\u2019m never buying another car again in my life. In my life. Porsche, there is no subset there. That is my promise. I\u2019m never buying another car in my life, ever. Ever!You know what ... Ever. I bought my last car. It\u2019s great to enjoy your youth once you\u2019re old enough to really enjoy it. Buy a Porsche. I\u2019ve bought my last car. I\u2019m making that my fail of the week, car people, because I\u2019m never buying a car. Let\u2019s get to one fail. Facebook losing its Oculus founder. Oculus, the whole thing is stupid. No it\u2019s not. Virtual reality, you bought into this? No, it is not. VR? I love VR. Oh my God. That\u2019s going to be another, next week. VR, right up there with 3-D printing. No, VR is going to be a big thing. \u201cOpen new worlds!\u201dTwo things, I ran-What are commercial applications for VR? ... I did a VR, when I was riding a roller coaster in Hong Kong. I know, that\u2019s a lot. Oh there\u2019s a lot of commercial application for that. I can feel nauseous on my own.I\u2019m just telling you, it was great. It was an amazingly fun experience. How do you measure the value of that? Then I did something in the mall, these things, I can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re called. Strapped the computer on my back. My kids and I had the best time. Hours of fun, with VR, in a VR environment playing with each other, doing different things. Amazing. Okay. Video games and fun stuff in malls. Yeah, exactly. So what? That\u2019s a 500 million dollar industry. No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s much bigger than that. This is the biggest fail in technology. No, you\u2019re wrong. The empathy things, I think it has not been ... What are ... empathy? Empathy, things that you want to experience, I think it\u2019s going to be big. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb. Well, in five years, it\u2019s been an enormous dud, you know why? So what? Because one of our new Jesus Christ, Mark Zuckerberg, said it would \u201cunlock new worlds.\u201d It hasn\u2019t unlocked anything. It could. I think it will. AR. I\u2019m with you on AR. Okay. AR, all right.Holding up a phone to an apartment building-So he left. So you don\u2019t think the Oculus founder, but what I\u2019m thinking more is that, all of these leaders are leaving Facebook. That\u2019s what I was talking about. Yeah, but I think on Oculus, it basically said the jig is up. The realized virtual reality is stupid. Oculus will probably be closed down in the next 24 months. All right. Oh, okay. We\u2019re going to move onto predictions in a second. Okay, then let\u2019s move onto predictions. Oculus ... Done. Is going to move ... This is your prediction, our next segment. I think Oculus is gone, in the next 24 months. It\u2019s too bad, because ... What about Magic Leap? Well, I want to promote Magic Leap, because I live in Florida, and we only have two real unicorns down there, Chewy and Magic Leap. Mm-hmm. Chewy! I think VR is ridiculous, right up there with 3-D printing, internet of things, all of these over-hyped... Internet of things? Why is that \u2026? What are you talking about? You only have one internet of thing, your iPhone. You don\u2019t need to connect your blender to the internet. No you don\u2019t, but I have Nest. You have these regulating your house, locks, things like that, sure. Yay. It\u2019s not a small thing. Internet of things, it\u2019s not working. All right. Okay. I think VR is an enormous dud. I think it\u2019s already dead on arrival. All right, okay. Any other predictions? What are yours? My prediction? I think Uber is going to go public, but it\u2019s not at that number. You think it\u2019s a lower valuation? I do. I do. Then what would they do? I think they would use the stock to go buy a bunch of hotel and transportation companies? Yes, yes. They gotta get while the getting is good, just the way Apple did. Yeah. I agree. If they go out at that number, they better start buying things that actually fill in the blanks. There\u2019s a lot of blanks there. What do you think happens before then? Do you think the labor force rallies or what do you think happens?  No. I think they\u2019re wildly disorganized, and that\u2019s an advantage to Uber.Nothing happens? I wish they would. I wish there was some great Cesar Chavez of the people of Uber, or something that would organize them. That would be great. 12,000 employees, 120 million dollars, that\u2019s literally 10 million dollars in equity value, for every employee. We\u2019ve never seen that in the history of corporate. I know. We\u2019ve never seen that in America. I think they need to be part of it. I think in the Airbnb thing, he\u2019s [CEO Brian Chesky is] trying to figure out a way to give the renters of the places equity. Yeah, some sort of equity. That\u2019s smart. He\u2019s trying to do that. Actually, Facebook is close. Half a trillion dollars. That\u2019s because he\u2019s a thoughtful, interesting man. You like him? I love him. I have a man crush. You develop crushes. No I don\u2019t. He\u2019s at least thinking about it! You don\u2019t hear it from them, until you hit them over the head with a hammer. So envision this, you\u2019re rolling down ... What\u2019s that? The 280. That highway out there that connects San Francisco. You\u2019re in the Porsche and in the back is Evan Spiegel rubbing your shoulders. Porsche. No, I like him. I like Evan. I\u2019m sorry that he\u2019s got some troubles, but I like him. All right. Scott. Yeah. I have to get out of there. Yeah I know. I\u2019ve got to go have coffee. I know. Hillary Clinton, blah, blah, blah. No. I have to interview her, and I have a little pre-interview thing. What\u2019s the most important question you\u2019re going to ask the Secretary? Well it\u2019s changed this week, because the pipe bombs and stuff like that. Yeah. I was going to talk to her about the mid-terms, obviously Russia, because she was right in my last interview about what the Russians had done, so I\u2019m going let her take a little victory lap off that. I think the elections, the impact to the Clintons, whether they should be around. I have to ask her about her comments about Monica Lewinsky.Just order the 21-year-old giving a president a blow-job, non-abuse-of-power lunch special, and see what happens. See what happens. See what happens.We have to talk about that. But I think this thing today, these attacks on Democratic, it\u2019s moved everything to the side. It\u2019s a really disturbing ... and she of course was-What are your views on that though? Do you think it\u2019s part of the coarseness of our discussion? No, it\u2019s what happens from the coarseness of our discussion. It\u2019s what happens, and it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s scary. The fact that the President of the United States gets up and says what he says is appalling. I don\u2019t even understand how someone could do that. I don\u2019t understand how people could work for people that do that. Back to the Clinton\u2019s, let me ask you this ... Clintons aren\u2019t our problem. Do they keep doing what they\u2019re doing, or do they take a victory lap and exit stage left? I have two minds. I think they should be able to do so. I think she should. I think John Kerry gets to talk, John McCain got to talk, he ran a very unsuccessful election campaign. Yeah. Men get to talk after they lose. Women have to skulk away, and put on the sackcloth and ashes, and shut up. I do get the issue around her husband and everything else, but I want her ... The things she did was say, \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights, and human rights are women\u2019s.\u201d Yeah. That took a lot of guts to do that, in China, back then. I want that Hillary Clinton. Well the bottom line, we probably picked the wrong Clinton for president, right? She probably should have been president. Well ... She\u2019s this uber-confident, hard-working person. What a shock. The men got to go first. There you go, right? Scott, thanks so much. And a lasting prediction for the elections. I interviewed Rebecca Traister this morning. She wrote a book about women and rage and anger, and I\u2019m in an angry mood today. Yeah. You\u2019re all of those things. Today, yes I am. Anyway, I\u2019m going to stay angry too. Thanks. Looking forward to talking to you next week. By the way, if you have questions for us on the podcast, shoot us an email at pivot@voxmedia.com.
