{"id": "Recode Daily: Amazon\u2019s HQ2 \u2014 a grail for two cities", "paragraph": "Amazon has finally announced the location(s) of its new headquarters: Northern Virginia \u2014 in the newly defined neighborhood of \u201cNational Landing\u201d \u2014 outside of Washington, D.C., and Long Island City, Queens, situated across the East River from Manhattan. These choices were not inspiring choices but data-based ones; the embodiment of Amazon\u2019s emotionless practicality. Here\u2019s what Amazon HQ2 employees will face in Long Island City when it comes to transportation, housing and \u2026 sewage. And here\u2019s how the two \u201cwinning\u201d locations compare to Amazon\u2019s original hometown of Seattle and the country at large. [Jason Del Rey / Recode]Facebook will allow a team of French regulators to \u201cembed\u201d inside the company to examine how it combats online hate speech \u2014 the first time the wary tech giant has opened its doors in such a way. Speaking at the Paris Peace Forum, French President Emmanuel Macron said that the trial project is an example of what he has called \u201csmart regulation,\u201d something he wants to extend to other tech leaders such as Google, Apple and Amazon; the six-month embed is scheduled for next year. Macron also released an international agreement on cybersecurity principles; the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace was signed by 50 nations, 130 private sector groups and 90 charitable groups and universities, but not the United States, Russia or China.

The American Cable Association, a group that represents a collection of small and independent cable companies, sent a letter to the DOJ requesting that officials open a formal investigation, saying that the deal poses \u201ca much greater threat to competition\u201d than AT&T\u2019s recent merger with Time Warner. Government restrictions attached to the deal had limited Comcast\u2019s ability to harm consumers, but those restrictions expired over the summer, opening the door to questionable business tactics such as withholding NBC\u2019s television programming from competing cable providers. [Brian Fung / The Washington Post] You know Jony Ive for the distinct mix of understatement and elegance he brings to the designs of Apple products. Apple\u2019s chief design officer has been working on something a little different: A diamond ring. Unlike most diamond rings that have a metal band made of gold or silver, Ive decided to \u201cthink different\u201d and instead created the entire ring out of diamonds. Rather than being sold in a jewelry store, the one-of-a-kind ring will be sold exclusively at a Sotheby\u2019s auction to raise funds to help eliminate HIV/AIDS in eight African countries. The ring, which will be made to fit the buyer, is expected to sell for between $150,000 and $250,000 at the Dec. 5 auction in Miami. Meanwhile, jewelry that belonged to Marie Antoinette, wife of King Louis XVI and arguably France\u2019s most famous queen, is headed to the Sotheby\u2019s auction block in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, Nov. 12. [Jeff John Roberts / Fortune]RIP, Stan Lee, the superhero of superheroes. The legendary writer, editor and publisher of Marvel Comics was responsible for such iconic characters as Spider-Man, the X-Men, Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther and the Fantastic Four. On his own and through his work with frequent artist-writer collaborators Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others, Lee catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world\u2019s No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant. In 2009, The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion, and most of the top-grossing superhero films of all time have featured Marvel characters. Here are 12 things you might have learned over two decades of lunches with Lee; and here is Lee\u2019s vision of the American dream.
