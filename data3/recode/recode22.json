{"id": "Recode Daily: The Khashoggi crisis exposed an online intimidation campaign ordered by the Saudi Crown Prince", "paragraph": "The apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has exposed details of a broad online intimidation campaign ordered by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to silence critics of his Saudi Arabian kingdom. Hundreds of people work at a so-called troll farm in Riyadh to smother the voices of dissidents like Khashoggi; the push also appears to include the grooming of a Saudi employee at Twitter whom Western intelligence officials suspected of spying on user accounts to help the Saudi leadership. Many Saudis had hoped that Twitter would democratize discourse by giving everyday citizens a voice, but Saudi Arabia has instead become an illustration of how authoritarian governments can manipulate social media to silence or drown out critical voices while spreading their own version of reality.[Katie Benner, Mark Mazzetti, Ben Hubbard and Mike Isaac / The New York Times][Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox?

Clegg\u2019s experience in British and European politics will be key, given that the European Union seems much more interested in and capable of regulating Facebook than U.S. politicians; hiring a former British politician is also a sign that Facebook sees potential European regulation as a major concern moving forward. [Kurt Wagner / Recode]Republicans are finding a way to work around Facebook with their own apps. Developed by a Washington, D.C.-based startup called uCampaign, apps like Cruz Crew, N.R.A. and Great America are effectively private social media platforms that offer conservatives safe spaces free from the content guidelines of the big platforms. Amid a chorus of conservative complaints that Facebook and YouTube have become hostile to right-leaning views \u2014 and as those social media giants take steps to limit what they see as abusive or misleading viral content \u2014 a few Republican consultants have begun building a parallel digital universe where their political clients set the rules.
