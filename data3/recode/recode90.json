{"id": "Netflix will get ads, predicts The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green ", "paragraph": "If you had a lot of money, you would pay for the privilege of not seeing ads, right?Sure, says Jeff Green, the CEO of the online advertising marketplace The Trade Desk. But most people around the world are willing to accept advertising as the price of free or cheaper media, and are getting \u201ctapped out\u201d on how many subscriptions they\u2019ll pay for.\u201cPeople are paying for cable and that cost has gone up,\u201d Green said on the latest episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka. \u201cThen, people pay for HBO, because there\u2019s so much great content on HBO, the content is the best it\u2019s ever been. Showtime has made up for lost time and releasing a lot of great shows, so, okay, I sign up for that. Now, I sign up for Netflix. Now, I sign up for Showtime. They are tapped out on subscriptions, so when Hulu says, \u2018Hey, we wanna give you an ad-funded option,\u2019 they do it.\u201dAnd Green believes Netflix will follow Hulu\u2019s lead soon enough, offering a cheaper ad-supported option alongside its existing ad-free subscriptions, because it needs to compete with the free-by-default YouTube. And he told Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka that he\u2019s said as much to Netflix\u2019s departing CFO David Wells (who sits on the board of The Trade Desk) and other executives at the company.\u201cThey\u2019ve envied YouTube\u2019s international reach for a very long time, where even less than two years ago, 80 percent of subscribers for Netflix were in the U.S.\u201d Green said. \u201cOur median household income\u2019s at $50,000-ish, roughly, a year ... compare that to all the places where there\u2019s growth in the world, which is also where advertisers are willing to pay ahead. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that they can catch up to YouTube, whose geographical distribution is exactly inverted, which is 80 percent comes from outside the U.S., unless they go ad-funded in the same way that YouTube is.\u201dThere\u2019s a direct line between this notion and Green\u2019s business, which connects ad agencies and brands with millions of advertising opportunities every second via computer-bought, or programmatic, ads. He said other media companies that are now chasing Netflix-style paywalls will still want to keep an advertising option around.\u201cI honestly think this is the model for lots of publications, which is okay, if you wanna pay a premium to avoid the ads that\u2019s fine,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut the default will be to see ads, and most people would rather see, especially fewer, highly relevant ads, which is only possible through programmatic.\u201dYou can listen to Recode Media wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Peter\u2019s conversation with Jeff.This is Recode Media with Peter Kafka, and that is me. I\u2019m part of the Vox Media Podcast Network. I\u2019m here at Vox Media headquarters in New York City, and I\u2019m here with Jeff Green, who is the CEO of The Trade Desk. Hello, Jeff.Hi, how\u2019s it going?We were just ... It\u2019s going well. We were saying we have not talked for a long time. We used to talk more frequently.It\u2019s been about five years, maybe.Jeff was someone who used to explain how ad tech worked to me.That\u2019s right, and I ...And at some point, I threw my hands up and said, \u201cThis is too complicated.\u201dI was gonna say, I think I scared you off and made you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to learn about this anymore.\u201dI think I\u2019m the dummy, though, because in the meantime, you went ahead and you were starting a business, I think, last time we talked.That\u2019s right.The Trade Desk. Since then, you\u2019ve taken it public.That\u2019s right.And even though a lot of people probably aren\u2019t familiar with it, if you\u2019re in ad tech, if you\u2019re buying and selling digital ads, you probably know about it. If you\u2019re a Wall Street investor, you apparently love this thing.That\u2019s right. Roughly our stock has gone up ... I mean, we IPO\u2019d at $18 a share and we now trade at about $130 a share.I think I saw $117 this morning.Yeah, it\u2019s bounced around a little bit in the recent months. But yeah.Something popped up in my feed earlier this summer; it said something something \u201cJeff Green ad tech billionaire.\u201d I thought, \u201cWait, that Jeff Green? Really?\u201d And I looked it up, I did the math, I think you\u2019re maybe merely worth $800 million.Oh, that depends on the stock price at any day.But wow, I really should\u2019ve paid closer attention to what you\u2019re doing.Yeah. No comment on that.All right. It\u2019s in the proxy, you can go ahead and do the math yourself.What I wanted you to do besides not talk about your personal wealth was give us a state of the state of the digital ad business. I think anyone who\u2019s listening to this podcast understands that Google and Facebook own the lion\u2019s share of that market; they gobble up more of it all the time, anyone who\u2019s tried to sort of compete with them eventually fades away. There was this idea that Verizon/Oath was going to compete with them, a lot of people thought that wouldn\u2019t work, and I think now that includes the people who run Verizon. But the premise of what you\u2019re doing is you are competing with Google and Facebook.Yeah, but we\u2019re not playing their game. I think the mistake that most companies have made in digital media is they take the Google/Facebook playbook and they just try to execute it themselves, and that\u2019s super hard unless you\u2019re backed by a quasi-monopoly in search, or social, or some other media. And especially in TV, that doesn\u2019t exist.So we look at it very differently, which is it is a very big internet. And in broad strokes, since we were kids, media\u2019s been fragmenting; you and I watched 13 TV stations when we were kids, now there\u2019s 500. Reed Hastings says there will be effectively millions in the sense that content creators are just becoming more and more abundant. And as that happens, the idea that all of that is going to be controlled by one or two companies is similar to the debate I had in college where everybody was like, \u201cIs the internet gonna be controlled by AOL? Because everybody seems to use them as their ISP.\u201d It\u2019s sort of ridiculous in my mind to think that those two companies would control everything. So what we do is we ...And even if they control the majority, right, that can leave a big chunk for someone like you to do well?Yeah, and we just think that things like Spotify has done so well, Pandora as well. But even things like great journalism, the New York Times, everything that\u2019s happening in TV, every website isn\u2019t going to be owned or monetized by Google. And as time marches on, more and more alternatives are created in the independent internet. And so what we say is you go to Google to buy Google.com, you go to Facebook to buy Facebook.com, and you come to us to buy all the rest, and the rest of it is way bigger than any one destination.So a lot of folks have made that pitch. We\u2019ll talk about why it has been working for you and maybe hasn\u2019t worked for other folks, but let\u2019s explain in as close to plain English as we can what you guys do. I think that\u2019s actually fairly simple; I mean, one of the problems with ad tech is that there\u2019s a million acronyms which make it hard to even approach.Yes.And then the entire ecosystem is very complicated as well, but let\u2019s try to break it down. So your clients are whom? Who is paying you money?So primarily our clients are agencies and sometimes brands, but primarily agencies. Generally, ad agencies, yeah, come to you and they want to buy ads.Yep. They\u2019re in the business of buying ads. On the Internet.Any digital ads that are typically transacted over the internet, we give them access to, with the exception of Facebook and Google.Right. So if they want to place an ad on, I don\u2019t know ... I don\u2019t know if you can place an ad on Vox Media, but in theory, they would do that. And they often have their own systems that are supposed to do this, or at least they spend a lot of money trying to create these systems that were supposed to do this.Yeah, not really. Not for programmatic or data-driven buys; they\u2019re dependent on companies like ours. And so we rep every major holding company in the world and do a significant amount of business. We highlighted that in 2017, more than 50 percent of the S&P 500 spent at least $1 million each with us.So you\u2019ve got access to this just giant world of digital ad inventory and you match up your buyers with a seller.That\u2019s right.You do it with computers, it happens incredibly fast. They\u2019re generally asking for things like ... They\u2019re not saying, \u201cI want to advertise on Vox.com,\u201d they\u2019re saying, \u201cI want a certain kind of buyer in the market for this kind of thing with these kind of attributes.\u201dThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right. So said another way, when you take all the websites in the world that are not Google and Facebook, there ends up being about nine million ad opportunities every single second. And so all of those are optimally monetized by essentially running an auction that lasts one tenth of a second. So every second, we\u2019re participating in nine million auctions, and then on behalf of that majority of the S&P 500 and their agencies, we\u2019re essentially saying okay, of those nine million, BMW needs to buy 117 of them, and P&G needs to buy 211 of them, and which ones should we buy? And it would be silly to just say, \u201cHey, we just want this user or we just want this site,\u201d but to actually look across all those vectors. And sometimes you use [a] site as a proxy for what your audience looks like, and other times you\u2019re actually using data about that audience, so you say, \u201cOh, these are all the people in market for a car,\u201d or whatever.And this business is working well for you. You did $300 million in revenue last year, you\u2019re on track for $464 million this year.Yeah. You know, roughly grew at 50 percent in $5 billion market cap company with 30 percent dividend margins, so meaningfully profitable with very few public companies with growth like ours.So this is programmatic advertising, right? So you\u2019re buying ... With the aid of computers in general ... It can mean different things, but generally you\u2019re using computer-assisted buying to buy people, not publications, essentially.That\u2019s right.And for years I watched this, and it was generally through the lens of publishers who saw this coming and said, \u201cThis is terrible. What\u2019s gonna happen as we charge a premium for the front page of this site or that site?\u201d And what you\u2019re gonna do is strip all of that out. And then if you talk to the ad tech guys publicly, they\u2019d say, \u201cNo no no. We\u2019re gonna find under-monetized inventory, and that\u2019s much more valuable than people think.\u201d Privately, they would say, \u201cAbsolutely. We are gonna strip out this margin that the New York Times or Time, Inc. or a BuzzFeed, or a Vox Media is charging,\u201d because people want the audience; they don\u2019t care where they find the audience.Yeah, so maybe it\u2019s worth going back to ... You know, I sold an ad exchange, a different business, to Microsoft, and was a part of the strategy team at Microsoft, and lived through ...That was back when Microsoft thought they might want to be in the advertising business.Yeah, that\u2019s right. Back when they were convinced they could win that space.This was back when they were interested in buying Yahoo.Exactly.They spent billions of dollars on digital advertising stuff, which they eventually just totally walked away from.Exactly, wrote off the $6 billion acquisition of aQuantive. They made some big moves, and they made also some big mistakes.But in that time, Yahoo and Microsoft had lots and lots of internal discussions about do we want to live in a programmatic world? Because essentially, what programmatic does so well is provide price discovery, and by price discovery, just for those of us that don\u2019t remember economics class in college, that\u2019s just the process where we enable people to understand the value of anything that\u2019s being transacted; so do I know what\u2019s in it? Like mortgage-backed securities struggled with price discovery, and that creates an anemic market where you ...What am I buying and who are the potential buyers and sellers?Exactly. And advertising has always struggled with that just because of the nature of what\u2019s being transacted. What exactly am I buying? Am I buying an audience, am I buying an ad, am I buying a publication? Like what is all the metadata I need to actually assign value to it? And what Yahoo and Microsoft were struggling with 10 years ago was the question of, do we really want price discovery? Because what happens is our sales people go out and pound the pavement, they tell a great story, and they convince people to buy our ads for a $10 CPM. If we gave away all that metadata so people could then assign their own value, what happens if they come up with a value of $1.50?Right.And in the middle of all that, you\u2019re right, there are a whole bunch of people who were informed but not objective telling all of them, \u201cNo, this is great!\u201d or \u201cNo, this is horrible!\u201d And all sides of it were weighing in, but you fast-forward 10 years and basically, the question has been answered.It\u2019s been answered by computers.By the market.The market and computers have said, \u201cThis is happening.\u201dAnd publishers. So perhaps, Yahoo and Microsoft were, number one, asking the wrong question, which was, instead of saying do we want to live in a programmatic world where price discovery happens, they should\u2019ve been asking the question, \u201cCan we stop it?\u201d Because I think if they would\u2019ve spent more time focused on that, they would\u2019ve realized that they couldn\u2019t, especially because Google, who didn\u2019t have a rate card to protect back then, accelerated the adoption and promotion of programmatic advertising.And then, when you get price discovery, which is what great markets do ... That\u2019s what the stock market does, that\u2019s what the solution to the mortgage-backed securities problem is, is enable price discovery. \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in that mortgage-backed security or that product that was bundled all together, so let\u2019s break it into pieces, let\u2019s get all the data so that I can actually assign value.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened to advertising over the last 10 years, and it turns out that when you apply data to advertising, it\u2019s way more effective than when you just buy it or transact using educated guessing, which is the way that the majority of the $700 billion in advertising is transacted.I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re knocking educated guessing; we love educated guessing. It helps provide advertising for this fine podcast. We\u2019re gonna hear from a sponsor right now. We\u2019ll be right back with Jeff Green.[ad]I was kidding but not kidding about how relatively ... Well, how really undeveloped podcast advertising is. We know next to nothing about the people who are listening. I sort of hear anecdotally from people who listen; thank you for telling me you listen. And I\u2019ve got a hunch about who\u2019s listening, and there are real problems with that. I really have only a vague idea of what people want and what to give them. It\u2019s also very freeing, because without the data, I can just sort of go ahead and make something I like, and the market isn\u2019t telling me otherwise. And there\u2019s a lot of folks who, when they talk about what\u2019s going to happen to podcast advertising ... It\u2019s like \u201cobviously we\u2019re going to add programmatic,\u201d and to me that seems like not a good thing. I get why it\u2019s efficient for advertisers. It seems like inevitably you\u2019re going to end up with what you see on the web, which is lots and lots of crappy ads. I know that programmatic doesn\u2019t have to result in crappy ads, but it seems like it inevitably does.Yeah, I don\u2019t think so. You and I disagree on that. So I think programmatic ads is the solution to the crappy ads. All the crappy ads are a byproduct of not being coordinated and not being data-driven. And digital and programmatic are not the same thing, and programmatic at its best uses a universal ID that you can then coordinate to all the data that comes from all ...We know, not \u201cJeff,\u201d but someone who has many of Jeff\u2019s characteristics.An anonymized ID. User A.Right, is consuming this media; would you like to reach him?Yeah. And let me tell you things about Jeff: He listens to this podcast, he also goes to Spotify 17 times a day, he also spends a lot of time on Yahoo Finance. There\u2019s a bunch of insights about User A that can help us identify what sort of content we should put in front of him.But for years, I\u2019ve been hearing about this targeted advertising, and man, I just keep getting tons of ads that either I\u2019ve seen, or I\u2019ve been to Zappos and I\u2019ve bought the shoes and they\u2019re still chasing after me, or someone in my house used a computer and Googled something I\u2019m not interested in but their IP address shows up there. And it\u2019s well over a decade I\u2019ve been hearing about the marvels of targeted advertising, what it\u2019s gonna deliver, and that\u2019s just on the web, let alone TV or anything else that has yet to come. It seems like this stuff doesn\u2019t really deliver what we\u2019re hearing it\u2019s going to deliver.It\u2019s just been slow. So of the $700 billion ... So first of all, the size of advertising is massive, and transforming that takes some time. And especially because ... You know, people have tried to give Google and Facebook a lot of credit for fixing all of digital advertising, or for being the Holy Grail of advertising; really they\u2019ve focused on monetizing their own destinations, and they\u2019ve actually made it much harder to be coordinated on all the rest of it. And then on the rest of it, there have been a whole bunch of companies with bad business models, most of which have gone away in the last few years, but a lot of them are sort of limping along, and those perpetuate some of the problems.Back to Google and Facebook, how do they make it harder for advertising to succeed on the rest of ... Other than the fact that they make their own sites so attractive?Well, so one, I would ... Yeah, well I\u2019ll come back to the making it attractive. But the reason they make it harder is because Google and Facebook will say ... So let\u2019s say that you wanted to show 20 ads to one user, so we\u2019ll go back to User A; you want to show 20 ads to me. And then in digital you say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna give eight to Facebook and I\u2019m gonna give eight to Google, and then I\u2019m gonna spend four on all the rest.\u201d When you give those eight to Google and Facebook, if you say, \u201cHey, I want to then know which user, to User A, I showed those to and I want to get a report as to how many ads I actually showed,\u201d all you can do is pass to Google or Facebook, \u201cHey, I know these users.\u201d And if you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re reliant on them to track them, show the right ads to them. But when you then say, \u201cOkay, which users did you show them to? Can you give me a report?\u201d they won\u2019t. They can, but they won\u2019t give you a report about any user so that you could then take it over to Google ...Is that for competitive reasons? Or will they say that\u2019s for privacy reasons because they don\u2019t actually track the user, we don\u2019t actually sell their data \u2026 ?The short answer is it\u2019s both. Forget about what they\u2019ll tell you; the short answer is it\u2019s both. So they don\u2019t want to make it possible for you to take the users from Facebook over to Google. And privacy\u2019s a legitimate reason for them to say that because they don\u2019t want you to take Facebook users, but even if you brought the users to them and said, \u201cI told you it was User A,\u201d they can\u2019t give you a report back.So that means you\u2019re gonna bombard them with ads on Facebook and not know how many you showed them, and you\u2019re not gonna know that User A on Facebook is the same as User Z on Google, and that\u2019s the same as User M on the independent internet. And so those can\u2019t be coordinated at all.Let me go back to something I was talking about before the first ad-supported break, this idea that programmatic is inevitable; people tried to hold it off forever, it showed up. There are lots of people who have been struggling to keep publishing ad-supported publications, and they often point to programmatic as the culprit. Do you think that is accurate, and do you think it\u2019s fair? They\u2019re two different questions.Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s either accurate or fair. I\u2019m saying my revenue\u2019s been declining for this many years, and it is because of programmatic/Facebook/Google that the revenue I used to be able to generate, I no longer can because the market is taking it away from me.Yeah, so I think the paradigm has shifted from that for any publisher who\u2019s informed about the way monetization works today. It does require active involvement as a publisher. I believe this is super important for the future of journalism. It doesn\u2019t mean that every journalist needs to understand it, but somebody at each publication, to use your word, needs to understand how monetization works. That does require ... I believe the future of that depends on their ability to understand programmatic advertising. Because Google and Facebook \u2014 especially Google, where they have the AdSense-like program \u2014 they take really high margins from publishers. Those margins over time, in my view, and it\u2019s hard to triangulate, have gone up. There\u2019s this whole open internet where there\u2019s forced competition among those. There\u2019s these business models called ad exchanges or SSPs, supply-side platforms, that those businesses have struggled a lot over the last five years, and it\u2019s because of competition. That\u2019s great for publishers, because those businesses are competing head-to-head with each other, and their margins have been compressed.Their margins are going down, but you don\u2019t hear publishers saying, \u201cBoy, it\u2019s great these guys are competing, because my revenue is going up. The amount of money I can charge per eyeball is going up.\u201d They say the opposite. They say it\u2019s going down. It\u2019s grinding down. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m laying off my sales force and replacing with programmatic is not because I want to, it\u2019s because that\u2019s all I can do.\u201dI think there is this process of price discovery that is absolutely happening, and the only remedy to that is to actually layer data on top of it and not avoid the price discovery process. It\u2019s back to that Yahoo-Microsoft debate. You can say, \u201cIt was great when we had a sales force pounding the pavement.\u201d And for bigger publishers, I get the longing to be in yesterday.You like the old days. You liked it.Yeah, I get that inclination.Just like the record labels ...Like record labels. ... we can sell $15 CDs.It\u2019s the same thing that CBS says when they\u2019re looking at Netflix.I guess the thing ...But there is no way to stop ...The twinge is you have people with a self-inflated sense of worth, like myself, but it\u2019s very common in media, right? Like, \u201cWe\u2019re different, we should be protected. It\u2019s important that the stuff we do finds some way to get out there.\u201d Also, it does feel different to ... You know, because a news story is not a Milli Vanilli single.Yeah.Actually a lot more. Which is why, you know, I joke about this, but not really, about half the people who come in here and sit where you\u2019re sitting are explaining to me their new subscription model, putting up a paywall. We\u2019re recording is on a Wednesday, which means this week alone we\u2019ve heard two different publications announce some sort of paywall subscription model that\u2019s gonna augment what they\u2019ve already got. And that\u2019s them all basically saying, \u201cAds alone aren\u2019t gonna support our business. We need to find a new revenue stream.\u201d Right now, everyone is just lurching into subscriptions. You can argue that a subscription itself is a good idea for a business model, but they\u2019re not doing it, again, because they want to. They\u2019re doing it because the ad business is evaporating.I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. Again, with 700 billion, if you just take current growth rates, marching towards a trillion dollar industry ...You\u2019re talking about the overall market, right? But these publishers that used to command revenue of X are now 50 percent of X.If you look at public statements that Hulu has made ... So, Hulu is such an amazing case study. Spotify\u2019s another great case study, which is when you go to consumers and you say, you can either see the ads or you can pay more for the subscription. In both cases, between 75 percent and 80 percent of consumers say show me the ads. That\u2019s astonishing. I still ...And Hulu makes more money off of the ad-funded model than they do off of subscription. I still have a sneaking suspicion that Hulu, because of its ownership structure, and we\u2019ll see what happens as that changes, has a vested interest in keeping the ad model going, right? \u2018Cause they\u2019re all the TV guys, and they still live in a world where TV ads really matter a lot, and if they were selling an ad-free service, it\u2019d be difficult for them to justify the conventional service they\u2019re selling. I just sense they aren\u2019t entirely enthusiastic about the ad-free model.I think you\u2019re giving them too much credit for being cunning. I think everybody\u2019s going where they can make money, and the rising cost of content is making everybody say, \u201cWhat is the best way to monetize?\u201d I think if you look at the way that YouTube has done, and especially, I mean, you look at the moves that even Netflix is making this week, in the sense that they\u2019re trying to go to international markets where household incomes are quite low. I mean, you look at what we\u2019ve experienced in connected TV. The growth that we\u2019ve seen in ad-funded connected TV is something I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen before and will never see again. It is so amazing to see how ...From zero.From zero, four years ago, to where we are today. So, I mean, just a couple numbers: In Q4 last year, we reported that year over year, connected TV inventory went up by 10X. In Q1 this year, we said the connected TV spend on our platform went up by 2,100 percent. Q1 this year over Q1 last year. So, to go to that base, and then this quarter most recently, we reported that connected TV spend went up 10X again. All of that is ad-funded, and it\u2019s largely because of cord cutting and, especially, in our view, it\u2019s the subscription model is tapped out in the sense that, okay, people are paying for cable and that cost has gone up. Then, people pay for HBO, because there\u2019s so much great content on HBO, the content is the best it\u2019s ever been. Showtime has made up for lost time and is releasing a lot of great shows, so, okay, I sign up for that. Now, I sign up for Netflix. Now, I sign up for Showtime. They are tapped out on subscriptions, so when Hulu says, \u201cHey, we wanna give you an ad-funded option,\u201d they do it. Because David Wells is ...You know, we had Anthony Wood from Roku in here a little while ago, and again, he\u2019s talking his book \u2018cause this is his business, but he says, the major search on Roku was free movies. \u201cWhere do I get free something something,\u201d so they\u2019ve got a channel where it says that. And 70 percent of their revenue is ad revenue.Right. From where I sit, the people I talk to, whenever we can opt out of ads, we do it. And Netflix is 150, 170 million people all watching stuff without ads. That seems crazy to imagine that people are gonna accept ads once you got a widely distributed service where you don\u2019t have to watch them. But Anthony and you and other folks say there\u2019s a lot of people who will tolerate it, either because the money\u2019s important to them or they\u2019re not that offended by ads or they\u2019re used to it or some combination of it.Yeah, so I was just about to mention that David Wells, the CFO of Netflix, is on our board. We talk about this concept all the time, and I have said to him, \u201cI believe that it\u2019s inevitable that you have an ad offering.\u201dAt Netflix?At Netflix. He\u2019s no longer the CFO of Netflix.Yeah, that\u2019s right. Soon, he will not be. But I do believe, and I\u2019ve said it to multiple C-levels at Netflix, that I do believe that it\u2019s inevitable that ... I mean, I think they\u2019ll always have the premium offering where if you want to avoid them, you can, but they\u2019ve envied YouTube\u2019s international reach for a very long time, where even less than two years ago, 80 percent of subscribers for Netflix were in the U.S. When you look at our median household income\u2019s at $50,000-ish, roughly, a year ... compare that to all the places where there\u2019s growth in the world, which is also where advertisers are willing to pay ahead. I don\u2019t think there any chance that they can catch up to YouTube, whose geographical distribution is exactly inverted, which is 80 percent comes from outside the U.S., unless they go ad-funded in the same way that YouTube is. So, I think that a few years from now, the same way that they\u2019ve stratified their pricing and given lots of options, I honestly think this is the model for lots of publications, which is, okay, if you wanna pay a premium to avoid the ads that\u2019s fine, but the default will be to see ads, and most people would rather see, especially fewer highly relevant ads, which is only possible through programmatic. So, the people you\u2019ve been talking to all have massive scale, or on their way to massive scale. Google and Facebook have, obviously, massive scale. YouTube has massive scale. One thing that Google and Facebook, YouTube, Twitter to a lesser degree, have all dealt with over the last couple of years is, we have these things that are massive. They\u2019re built to sort of work on their own. People upload their information, advertisers plug in their information, lots of stuff sort of happens mechanically, and then oops. We\u2019ve got content that we\u2019re not happy with or advertisers end up next to content they\u2019re not happy with, and we\u2019re gonna try to solve this with a combination of humans and computers, but boy, it\u2019s really hard. It seems to me that the common connection there is they\u2019ve all built these massive things that are, no matter how diligent they are, really impossible to properly vet. So, you\u2019re always going to end up, unless you just really, really ... if you cut off most of your market and just whitelist a handful of things, you\u2019re always gonna end up with a chance that Tide is gonna end up next to some horrible racist video. I assume you guys have that same problem, which is you can only guarantee advertisers up to a certain point that they\u2019re gonna have what we call brand safety.Yeah. So, you are right. You can never give anybody the assurance that nothing bad\u2019s gonna happen.But you could with a newspaper or a TV advertisement.I don\u2019t know. I mean ...Pretty close.You watch an ad like a kid playing soccer and you didn\u2019t realize that you were running in the \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d episode where the kid was kidnapped while playing soccer.But generally, you do. You know, and they would say we don\u2019t wanna be near news. I worked at Forbes, and I remember we had to take down an ad that had a plane in it \u2018cause it came after 9/11, and it was manual and you could say, \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna be near that.\u201dExactly.But that\u2019s the point. So, these were all manual, you knew exactly how many slots you had during \u201cCriminal Minds,\u201d and you knew who was gonna advertise.Yeah, but you still had to run a manual process, and people still called and yelled at you and you had to do crazy make-goods to fix all those sorts of things. So, will there still be problems? Of course. But the technology that we can apply to create brand safety and, of course, augment that human judgment, where before that was based on human judgment and there was spray and pray.\u2019Cause you were talking about what? Nine million or nine billion impressions?Nine million a second.Nine million, these are bids or ad impressions campaigns?Ad impression opportunities.Right. So, I can\u2019t possibly vet those. Right? You can try to do your best to sort of sort ...Yeah, but you know what sites they\u2019re coming from, you know what suppliers they\u2019re coming from. I mean, to me, the biggest reason why there were fewer complaints 20 years ago is because the tracking was so bad that you didn\u2019t actually know where it ran. So it isn\u2019t that there was worse content, it\u2019s just that you couldn\u2019t track it as easily. Oh, this reminds me. I\u2019ve always wanted to ask someone, at least on air, why this happens. So, I\u2019m on my iPhone, which has pretty good safety, and I click on a link, it\u2019s from a reputable site and it\u2019s to another reputable site, and I get there and up pops this fake Amazon ad saying \u201cYou\u2019ve won\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s impossible to back out of it. I know that it\u2019s not Amazon. I get out of it, but inevitably this is because it\u2019s a bug inserted into someone\u2019s programmatic advertising, and people who don\u2019t know better go, \u201cWhy does Amazon have these lousy ads?\u201d Why do I see these ads in 2018?Yeah, so to be clear, we don\u2019t have anything to do with those ads. We don\u2019t run those. Those are fraudulent.Right. No one wants to run those ads, but they show up. Yeah, so the way that those run, it\u2019s, essentially, Adware or somebody makes a bunch of money by inserting that into an app, typically. So, at one of those times when you trusted somebody to download an app and said yes, I\u2019ll give you access to my phone, they then use that to put this fake ad in front of you saying, \u201cHey, we need you to enter your Apple gift card.\u201dThis is I\u2019m on Twitter or Facebook or wherever, any reputable site, and I click on it, and I\u2019m going to reputable site B, and it pops up. I\u2019m assuming it pops up because of one of the programmatic slots that they\u2019re selling that they don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually going through their site.Most typically, it\u2019s not because Facebook enabled this. It\u2019d because of one of the people that Facebook or somebody else has ...Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Vox Media, for instance. I\u2019m sure Vox Media\u2019s had these problems in the past.But what happens is somebody that Vox is associated with, or any of these companies is associated with, it\u2019s one click or sometimes two clicks removed. They are not reputable, and then they put an ad in front of you, basically, taking over your phone or getting access to that app so that they can put this in front of you, and hopefully, trick you into giving your ...Right. And from what I understand \u2014 I\u2019m sort of answering my own question, it seems \u2014 I mean, this is, like you said, it\u2019s malware. No one wants this. It\u2019s the same thing as getting spam in my email, but it\u2019s basically whack-a-mole. Like, you can try diligently to track this stuff down, but since you really ... \u2018cause you\u2019re not controlling the ads that show up on your site very often, right? \u2018Cause it\u2019s done automatically, and that you can\u2019t possible vet everything that\u2019s coming through so you end up with bugs like this.But no, so it\u2019s not ... I mean, it all depends on where you accept demand from. I don\u2019t know much about it, because we don\u2019t power advertisers like this, so we wouldn\u2019t be the ones to help them get on any site or anything like that. Then, most often, it\u2019s somebody who has installed their own app, and then they\u2019re the ones controlling the ad as well, \u2018cause they have to control both the supply and the demand or else they would get shut down. \u2018Cause if Vox knew what they were doing, they would turn it off.Right, and eventually, they will go turn it off once they track it down, but a human being has to go track ... someone has to report it.That\u2019s right.A human being has to go find it. Inevitably, these guys have moved on, and they\u2019re working in ... It\u2019s very cheap for them to do this, the same way it\u2019s cheap to send you Viagra ads. Yeah, so really, what has to happen is, companies have to be super diligent about making certain that those ads don\u2019t run. Yeah, I guess what I\u2019m really getting at is it just seems like so much scale and so much automation. There\u2019s gonna be a limit to what you can do to make sure that, whether it\u2019s malicious stuff, whether it\u2019s literally just Zappos just spamming me, right? They know I\u2019ve been to their site, but it\u2019s apparently too much work for them to figure out that I actually bought the shoes, so they\u2019re just gonna keep hammering me with the shoe ad, and it costs them fractions of a penny to send that out. I lose \u2018cause I don\u2019t like seeing that ad. It seems like, inevitably, the whole ecosystem loses, because they\u2019re making ads less relevant.That\u2019s right.But Amazon/Zappos is acting rationally by just ... on the off chance that I didn\u2019t buy the shoe, why not make sure I can see it again?That\u2019s right, and that\u2019s much more relevant to our world, \u2018cause we will power brands like that. What we\u2019re trying to help them do, and this is part of the reason why the rest of the open internet is so important, and why more and more advertisers are saying to us, \u201cWe would rather spend our first dollars on this open internet and then give the leftovers to Google and Facebook, because I get to track holistically in that world, and then I know I\u2019m not bombarding it.\u201d Because it\u2019s that fragmented world of User A and User M and User Z are all the same. When you add a whole bunch of other ways to buy, like Snap and Pinterest and all these sort of walled gardens \u2014 Roku \u2014 all of these are sort of closed ecosystems where you get a new sense of a user in each of those. When they\u2019re not coordinated at all, then the advertiser can\u2019t control how much they bombard you. This is, actually, I think the biggest problem in advertising today, is coordinating that so that buyers can buy holistically, because they don\u2019t want to spend billions of dollars to make you hate them. But in aggregate, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing. And so we work with the biggest advertisers in the world to be better coordinated about it, so they\u2019re making data-driven choices so that you love them, because advertising was really about winning hearts and minds, not just about navigation and certainly not about tricking you.We keep circling around the Facebook and Google question, so I get why you want someone to spend money away from Facebook and Google, and I get why a lot of advertisers either say and/or believe that they would be better off supporting an ecosystem that isn\u2019t dominated by two people. But inevitably, they\u2019re not going to give you money just out of good will or some sort of aspiration.Of course.So what is the real-world pitch that is getting them to spend money with you instead of with Google or Facebook?So often, advertisers are taking their data, which is the most valuable data to them, and they\u2019re being asked by walled gardens like Google and Facebook to put their data in their ecosystem, and because those companies control massive amounts of media, it enables them to raise prices on the media that they\u2019re buying, and then they don\u2019t get any report back. So more and more advertisers, especially big, sophisticated, data-driven advertisers, are frustrated by the asymmetry of that partnership. And they are more committed to using their data in a safe and consumer-friendly way so that they can then do the right thing and actually spend billions to make consumers love them instead of spending billions to annoy them or frustrate them.But on the other hand, right, the reason Google and Facebook are so dominant is in part, if not entirely, because they are such good advertising solutions, right? Google. Google knows what you\u2019re looking for. Facebook knows a ton about you. Google does, as well. People aren\u2019t spending with Google or Facebook because they\u2019re lazy, right? They\u2019re getting results. The same savvy buyers are buying on Facebook for a reason.Well, so those companies are big enough that even savvy buyers have to spend some amount of money with them. There\u2019s no question of that, but much of their growth, and you said if not entirely because of their efficiency, or whatever. I actually think we\u2019ve given them a lot of credit for efficacy, when in truth they deserve a lot of credit for easy. So Facebook has done an amazing job of making it possible to spend money in 90 seconds on their platform. It is super easy to get started, and again, you give them data, you give them creative, and then they\u2019ll take that and run with it. But more and more advertisers want more control and they want a more symmetrical relationship, and I think there\u2019s even an argument to be made that what, especially, Google has done is not really advertising in terms of their cash cow, which is titles and descriptions. Those don\u2019t win hearts and minds. I\u2019ve never read a text link and said, \u201cOh, I love this company.\u201d Instead it\u2019s navigation, and that\u2019s valuable, and we pay for it, and I believe in them as a company. I don\u2019t believe that they\u2019ll ever be dethroned as the king of search. I totally get the value of it, but in terms of the process of winning hearts and minds, the thing that those two companies have done better than anybody is, No. 1, easy. It\u2019s not about efficacy. It\u2019s about easy. And then the No. 2 thing that they\u2019ve done super well is they\u2019ve taken credit for all of advertising when in fact, in many cases, they\u2019re not even advertising. And what I mean by this is they say at Mercedes-Benz it takes 20 years to be a Mercedes-Benz owner. They show you ads for 20 years. At the end of that, you type in \u201cbuy Mercedes-Benz.\u201d It takes you to local dealership. You click on the link, and then you say, \u201cThank God for Google,\u201d and Google says, \u201cWe did that.\u201d And they\u2019ve done an amazing job of convincing people that they did that when they were just one part of the funnel.One company we haven\u2019t spent much time talking about is Amazon. We\u2019ve been hearing for years Amazon\u2019s coming into advertising. They\u2019re coming into advertising, and we keep hearing it now, and now there\u2019s a significant amount of money being spent on Amazon. Do you look at them as a competitor to Google and Facebook? Are they a competitor to you, or are they in another category?Yeah, so I mentioned earlier that I don\u2019t really compete with Google in the sense that ...You just spent a long time explaining why someone should buy with you instead of Google.Well yeah, but Google runs a search engine, right? And they\u2019ve done that super well. I would never try to build a search engine. I had this argument at Microsoft, where I just didn\u2019t think that we would win.You\u2019re competing for advertising dollars with them.Yeah, I want as much of that $700 billion pie as anybody, but there will be a channel that\u2019s going to do great forever, which is search. Whether that\u2019s advertising or not, it\u2019s going to come out of that advertising pie. And Google, I think, for as long as I can see in the future is going to get a share of that. But I think the stuff that\u2019s most on sale and the most undervalued and the biggest opportunity for advertisers is in the open internet, which isn\u2019t easy to get to. So in that sense, I do compete against Google, but I don\u2019t run a search engine. I don\u2019t have a space program. I don\u2019t have self-driving cars. I don\u2019t lay fiber in the Pacific Ocean. And the thing that is really interesting about Amazon is that they sell sponsored listings that are mostly connected to search, and you can make the argument that they\u2019re the second-largest search engine in America and that they are absolutely competing with Google\u2019s No. 1 priority. I compete with Google\u2019s No. 47 priority, which is their DSP that ...Their display ads.Well, not display, because display is less than 30 percent of my business. Forty-six percent of my business comes from mobile. Connected TV and video is about the same as what display is for me. So I\u2019m not competing with Google on display, but I am competing with their DSP business.But so you think Amazon is a threat to Google but not a threat to your business.Yeah. I think Amazon\u2019s primary focus and where all the surge in their advertising dollars has come from is from them monetizing Amazon.com, largely as a search engine.To people who are already selling stuff on amazon.com generally.Exactly. And they\u2019ve done super well, and it\u2019s a huge opportunity.I think if you said, \u201cWell, these are slotting fees,\u201d right? Because that\u2019s kind of what they are, right? They\u2019re paying to get their stuff in front of someone who\u2019s coming in to shop, that becomes a less sexy story, but maybe a more accurate one. Yeah, so and slotting fees, you could make the argument that it\u2019s the new end cap, that they\u2019re trying to compete with what the end cap was at Walmart 15 years ago. You could also make the argument that it\u2019s sponsored listings that compete with high-ranked keywords on Google. I think both of those are legitimate arguments. It\u2019s hard to make the argument that it\u2019s an objective omnichannel DSP. That\u2019s not really what they\u2019re doing.I don\u2019t want to try to unpack \u201comnichannel DSP.\u201d I do want to ask you about ... This will involve acronyms, but GDPR, let\u2019s just call it regulation.All right. You want to avoid omnichannel but we\u2019re going to go to GDPR.Let\u2019s talk about regulation. There\u2019s an overall push. There\u2019s a bunch of digital advertising regulation went into effect this spring in Europe, but it affects American companies, and there is now constant talk about more regulation coming, whether it\u2019s realistic or not. How does that affect your business?So GDPR has been actually fantastic for out business, and it\u2019s in part because we\u2019ve been privacy-centric from the very beginning, and we also have this luxury of only transacting in anonymous data, so back to our Users A and M and Z. We only take benign behaviors and connect those to anonymous IDs. We don\u2019t gather data or have to manage data the way that Google does through a search engine, where you basically give them every detail about your life. So when every health condition you\u2019ve ever had you enter into Google, or every political opinion you\u2019ve ever had you type into Facebook, those sorts of things never get transacted with The Trade Desk and certainly not correlated to directly identifiable information.See, I mean, those things are really meant to, in large part, sort of slow down Google and Facebook.Well, I think it\u2019s meant to ... In broad strokes, what GDPR is after is very noble, which is to ask that ecosystem to better explain the quid pro quo of the internet, which is that you get free content in exchange for seeing ads and sharing some amount of data.And we would like, in theory, it\u2019s built on this idea that you, the consumer, or the reader, whatever it is, you\u2019re going to opt in. You\u2019re going to raise your hand and say, \u201cI want in on this.\u201d That\u2019s exactly right. The reality, you get this pop-up thing and it says, \u201cClick this so you can keep reading,\u201d and you click it ...Yeah, or yeah, \u201cRead this 74-page EULA and we\u2019ll explain clearly.\u201dIt\u2019s marginally better than where it used to be, which was there is no chance to opt in and you could raise your hand and opt out, but you had to find the little click mark on the ad. No real person ever did it. Lots of people bought ad blockers or got ad blockers as a response, but they didn\u2019t actually click out. But anyway, that doesn\u2019t affect your business.No, so because of the fact that we have always been transacting in a way that\u2019s compliant with GDPR, it wasn\u2019t a big change for us. And as a result, as companies have shied away from those who they\u2019re less sure of, and in some cases that includes Facebook, dollars have moved over to us. So Germany for us, which is sort of in the middle of the GDPR debate, grew last quarter for us, 200 percent over Q3. We\u2019ve been in that market for four years. It\u2019s a material increases as a result of just GDPR.Other big trends ... We talked about video broadly, but lots of folks trying to do what Netflix and Hulu are doing, which is sell you something direct to the consumer. Disney will launch something next year. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re hoping to partake in that burst of new people selling stuff directly to consumers. You think there\u2019s a role for you in there?Yeah, so in all those numbers I was sharing earlier on just the huge success that connected TV has been for us, that is where it\u2019s coming from.So that\u2019s already happening.Yeah, so the first group that we had lots of success with was virtual MVPDs, because as those are competing with each other\u2019s ...The Slings of the world.Yeah, exactly. And there\u2019s dozens of others, and as they\u2019re competing with each other they can\u2019t afford to have salespeople pounding the pavement, so programmatic is the only way for them to get ads with reasonable CPMs. And of course, as those become more data-driven it produces amazing CPMs so that they can actually sustain their business. And then, of course, lots of those come as skinny bundles. So there\u2019s, of your 500 stations, there\u2019s 15, 20 in there. That means the other 480 are working really hard to develop relationships directly with consumers, and in almost all cases we\u2019re working with them so that we can be the primary source of demand.I feel like this is your pitch book now. So we\u2019re explaining all the opportunities for you, and the last one would be China. Right? Yeah.Or a big one would be China.Yeah, China\u2019s humongous, of course. Billion consumers. One of the things we think we\u2019re in a really great position regarding is just the fact that we\u2019re objective. So we\u2019ve never played on the sell side, and so as a result we can partner with everybody in media. So there\u2019s lots of people in TV, for instance, that say, \u201cI never want to partner with Google or Facebook or Amazon, because I\u2019m afraid of them, paying a tax forever.\u201d So it\u2019s the reason a lot of premium content has been resistant to monetize on YouTube. They\u2019re just afraid of a tax.A tax, meaning?Meaning Google would take a share of that that is too high. So as a result of us not ever owning media, we can partner with Google, which we have.Because you\u2019re not competing with them in the way that Google and Facebook inevitably do with some of their partners that have suppliers.That\u2019s right. And then we can also partner with Fox, or we can also partner with Comcast. I also partner with AT&T.So explain the China connection.... but also partner with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent at exactly the same time.In 2018 there\u2019s a lot of saber-rattling between China and the U.S. Does that factor into sort of how you think that might go? Do you see a point where maybe you can\u2019t do business in China? You\u2019re based in Southern California.Yeah, so I moved to Hong Kong in March of this year.Oh, really?I\u2019ve lived in Asia for the last six months, and it\u2019s all about the opportunity in Asia. So during that time, we announced partnerships with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. We just announced our partnership with Tencent publicly earlier this week, and that includes all their video assets and things like iQiyi.So if you\u2019re partnering with a Chinese company, you have to be approved, essentially, by the state there.That\u2019s right.Do you feel like those deals are going to start raising flags in the U.S., and or that someone, especially now that you got the ... Well, who knows politically, but do you think that politically in the U.S. people might say, \u201cWe would like you to back off that business\u201d?No. I personally think the world is way too big and integrated for that to be stopped, and I think the saber-rattling is ridiculous and bad for both economies.So you think at some point that both sides return to their corners and move on.Well, that\u2019s assuming that leaders will be rational, which isn\u2019t always the case.Tough. Tough case to make this week, or any week of the last year and a half.But because I believe those vectors are so huge, and because the opportunity and the dependence we have on the Chinese to manufacture and they have on us to spend, those two dependencies make it so we need each other desperately, and there\u2019s not really anything that can stop them.Jeff, this is great. I was right. We should do this more often.Yes, we should.Either recorded or not. I don\u2019t know that I learned everything I need to learn about ad tech, but I learned a lot, so thank you. We\u2019ll have to do it again, then. It\u2019s always a spirited discussion, and there\u2019s so much to talk about.Thank you for coming.Thank you.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
