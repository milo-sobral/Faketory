{"id": "Elon Musk: The Recode interview", "paragraph": "I\u2019ll be honest, I have been email haranguing Tesla and SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk for months about talking to me and today on Recode Decode, we have a special interview with one of the most-loved, often-controversial and generally most-talked-about figures in tech.On Halloween night, we sat down at Tesla HQ in Palo Alto for an 80-minute conversation about how those companies are faring, why he was working 120-hour weeks, his public animosity for the press, Donald Trump\u2019s Space Force, accepting money from Saudi Arabia and more. Also on the menu: Musk\u2019s rabid fans on Twitter, dying on Mars, a Tesla pickup truck that will look like something out of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and talk of an electric bike and VTOL plane \u2014 but not a Tesla scooter because those \u201clack dignity,\u201d apparently.There is one question I forgot to ask: Whether he thought he should remain CEO of Tesla after a year of terrible errors and why he thinks he deserves that job. But he answered that in many indirect ways here, presenting a more rested, happier and in-control entrepreneur who seems to be undaunted by his troubles. My favorite response showed he did understand those issues and his \u201cself-inflicted wounds\u201d: \u201cYeah, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s, like, self-inflicted wounds. In fact, my brother said, \u2018Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?\u2019 You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don\u2019t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?\u201dWhy indeed? Take a listen:You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a condensed version of my conversation with Elon Musk. You can read a full transcript of the interview here.Kara Swisher: I\u2019m here with Elon Musk at the headquarters of Tesla. We\u2019re gonna talk about Tesla, we\u2019re gonna talk about SpaceX, we\u2019re gonna talk about this year, we\u2019re gonna talk about The Boring Company, and anything else Elon wants to talk about, because people like to hear you talk. Let\u2019s start from the beginning, about this year. You\u2019ve given some very interesting interviews. You\u2019ve gotten on Twitter, made some mistakes.Elon Musk: What\u2019s Twitter?What\u2019s Twitter? Okay, let\u2019s start with Twitter. I have an obsession with Twitter, too, and an addiction. What happens with you and Twitter?Well, I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter.And why?I find it entertaining. I think, \u201cOh, other people might find this entertaining.\u201d Sometimes they do.Just at night? What are you, at home you\u2019re doing this?Yeah. Mostly at home. I spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It\u2019s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.Yeah, well people pay attention when you do that. Yeah. It\u2019s pretty interesting what my most ... What people are most interested in, like some little tweet about \u201cI love anime.\u201d That was it. But it was lowercase \u201ci\u201d, black heart, \u201canime,\u201d and people loved that. That was like one of my most popular tweets.What about the things they didn\u2019t love? Are you under strict orders not to do that? Is that correct? Will you be? Will you have to change your Twitter behavior?Not really. I think it\u2019s mostly just if it\u2019s something that might cause a substantial movement in the stock during trading hours. That\u2019s about it.Do you consider it a communications medium? How do you look at it? I look at it as a way to learn things, kinda stay in touch with what\u2019s happening. It feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s kinda weird. I guess I sometimes use Twitter to express myself, and that\u2019s a weird thing to do, I suppose.Not so much. It isn\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s very funny, other times it\u2019s not so funny.Some people use their hair to express themselves. I use Twitter.You pick fights with the press over Twitter, and then you have all your fans, of which there are many. Are you aware of what they do once you start them off?Well, I have to say, my regard for the press has dropped quite dramatically.Explain that, please.The amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable. Take that Wall Street Journal front-page article about, like, \u201cThe FBI is closing in.\u201d That is utterly false. That\u2019s absurd. To print such a falsehood on the front page of a major newspaper is outrageous. Like, why are they even journalists? They\u2019re terrible. Terrible people.I get that, but do you understand the mood in this country around the press and the dangers of attacking, especially when the president is doing that? In quite an aggressive, \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and everything else. It\u2019s disturbing when someone like you as a leader does that, too, or goes along with it.The answer is for the press to be honest and truthful, and research their articles and correct things properly when they are false. Which they don\u2019t do.Okay. But I\u2019m asking if you understand where it goes to.Yes, of course I do.What do you think of that? Are you worried about unleashing a dangerous cycle that a lot of the press are worried about? Justifiably. I suggest the press take it to heart and do better.What about what Donald Trump does, about \u201cenemy of the people\u201d? Do you look at it that way?No.Just that you don\u2019t like falsehoods.Yeah. There are good journalists and there are bad ones, and unfortunately the feedback loop for good versus bad is inverted, so the more salacious that an article is, the more salacious the headline is, the more clicks it\u2019s gonna get. Then somebody is not a journalist, they are an ad salesman.What about things that are just critical of you that you don\u2019t like? Do you think you\u2019re particularly sensitive? No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, \u201cOh. My article\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just thin-skinned.\u201d No, your article is false and you don\u2019t want to admit it.Do you take criticism to heart correctly?Yes.Give me an example of something if you could.How do you think rockets get to orbit?That\u2019s a fair point.Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won\u2019t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.Right. And therefore?I have a strong interest in the truth.All right. And you are \u2014Much more than journalists do.What I\u2019m trying to get to is, do you want to acknowledge when you do this it does set off ... People beyond you that listen to you, you have a fan base that\u2019s quite rabid, I would say.No, I wouldn\u2019t say that.No? I think they\u2019re great.All of them?No, not all of them.Let\u2019s talk about this year. What has gone on this year with you? It\u2019s been a very difficult year. We had the Model 3 production ramp, which was excruciatingly difficult. It is incredibly difficult to survive as a car company. Incredibly difficult. People have no idea how much pain people at Tesla went through, including myself. It was excruciating.Talk about that toll.Pretty sure I burnt out a bunch of neurons during this process. Running both SpaceX and Tesla is an incredibly difficult ... You realize we\u2019re fighting the incredibly competitive car companies. They make very good cars. They\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. They are entrenched. Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, you name it. All those car brands. And the history of car companies in America is terrible. The only ones that haven\u2019t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. That\u2019s it. Everyone else has gone bankrupt.You put too much pressure on yourself this year, or it just is what you\u2019re doing?It sounds like you\u2019re not hearing me. Making a car company successful is monumentally difficult. There have been many attempts to create a car company and they have all failed, even the ones that have had a strong base of customers, thousands of dealers, thousands of service centers, they\u2019ve already spent the capital for the factories, like GM and Chrysler, still went bankrupt in the last recession. Ford and Tesla made it barely through the last recession. There\u2019s a good chance Ford doesn\u2019t make it in the next recession. So, as a startup, a car company, it is far more difficult to be successful than if you\u2019re an established, entrenched brand. It is absurd that Tesla is alive. Absurd! Absurd.What do you credit that to?Excruciating effort.By you and \u2014Hundred-hour weeks by everyone.By everyone here at Tesla. Yes. There wasn\u2019t some other way to do this.What I want to get at is why you\u2019re doing that. It\u2019s not a trivial \u2026 Why do you think you want to push yourself that hard? Well, the other option would have been, Tesla dies.Right.Yeah. Tesla cannot die. Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation. The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production.Which I think most people credit you for doing. Pushing everyone else into it at the same time, correct?Yes. The success of Tesla is, by far, the biggest forcing function for the other carmakers to get into into electric cars. They\u2019ve said so.No, there\u2019s no question. I was just having a discussion with someone the other day, and I said, \u201cHe has pushed everybody into this, really dramatically. There wouldn\u2019t have been this much investment. There wouldn\u2019t have been this.\u201d Yes. It\u2019s very important for the future of the world. It\u2019s very important for all life on Earth. This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn\u2019t matter. If we do not solve the environment, we\u2019re all damned.And this way via sustainable transportation.Yes. It sort of blows my mind, all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars. It\u2019s outrageous. You\u2019re doing this to yourself because you think that the world depends ... Not the fate of the world. You\u2019re not a cartoon character. No, I think the electrification of transport, and there\u2019s also an important part of Tesla which is solar and stationary batteries, because you need to generate electricity in a standard, sustainable way with solar and then store it at night when the sun goes down with batteries, and then use that energy from the sun to power cars. Without Tesla, this would still happen. There would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years.So, pushing it forward by that much.Yes. I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that Tesla has advanced sustainable energy by at least five years, conservatively, and maybe closer to 10, and then if we continue to make progress, we might advance it by 20 years. This could be all the difference in the world.What is the toll on you? What has been the toll on you and your employees? How do you think about that? It\u2019s been terrible. This year felt like five years of aging, frankly. The worst year of my entire career. Insanely painful.Was there any other way to do it? You didn\u2019t think there was any other way to have it happen? Why this year? For this past year, it\u2019s been because of the Model 3 production ramp. Myself and others at Tesla, we had to go in and fix the mistakes in the Model 3 production system, and there were a lot of them. I personally solved a bunch. Jerome [Guillen] solved a bunch. Everyone helped, the entire team. Javier [Verdura], Franz [von Holzhausen], Deepak [Ahuja], everyone. It was ... like, we had the legal team delivering cars in Q3. Todd [Maron] is great. There was a lot of people ... Everyone had to basically go hardcore to solve the ramp.I want to get into Tesla specifically, and about the recent results, which I think people were surprised by. You surprised Wall Street and some of your competitors. But when you\u2019re thinking about doing this incredibly complex thing, do you regret some of the things you\u2019ve done to slow it down itself? You know, some of your tweets, some of it is self-inflicted. Do you not see it that way?Yeah, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s, like, self-inflicted wounds. In fact, my brother said, \u201cLook, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?\u201d You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don\u2019t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?So why do you do that?It\u2019s not intentional. Sometimes you\u2019re just under a lot of pressure, and you\u2019re not getting much sleep, you\u2019re under massive pressure, and you make mistakes.Is that over? Do you feel like that\u2019s over? Do you feel calmer now?It\u2019s totally over. I will never make another mistake again.No, I\u2019m teasing you. But how do you ... You look well. You don\u2019t look under a lot of pressure. You seem rested. Yeah. Things are back to a hard work schedule, but not an insane work schedule. I was, there were times when, some weeks ... I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours or something nutty. You\u2019re gonna go a little bonkers if you work 120 hours a week. Now we\u2019re down to 80 or 90. It\u2019s pretty manageable.And you had talked in the New York Times about using Ambien and stuff like that. That was to regulate your sleep, correct? Yeah. It\u2019s not like for fun or something.No, not at all. No, it\u2019s just like, if you\u2019re super-stressed, you can\u2019t go to sleep. You either have a choice of, like, okay, I\u2019ll have zero sleep and then my brain won\u2019t work tomorrow, or you\u2019re gonna take some kind of sleep medication to fall asleep.You turned in a great quarter. How do you look at where you\u2019re going with the Model 3 and others?I think at Tesla we\u2019re doing pretty well right now. Tesla\u2019s not staring death in the face. We\u2019re in, I think, a pretty good position. We don\u2019t want to be complacent, but it\u2019s not ... Up until around September, we were really faced with, like, \u201cWe must solve this or we\u2019re gonna die,\u201d constantly. I feel like we\u2019re no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation.What, is death over and sitting in a seat nearby? Well, you never want to get complacent, so we still need to work hard, but I think we\u2019re over the hump. We\u2019re certainly over the hump on Model 3 production. For us, making 5,000 cars in a week for Model 3 is not a big deal. That\u2019s just normal. Now we\u2019re working on raising to 6,000 and then 7,000 Model 3s a week, while still keeping costs under control. We could probably do 6,000 or more, maybe 6,500 Model 3s a week right now, but it would have to stress people out and do tons of overtime.Talk about the new navigation feature. Drive on Navigation?Right.That\u2019s I think one of the first major steps toward full self-driving. You can enter in an address, and from highway on-ramp to highway off-ramp, the car will change lanes. It will go from one highway to the next automatically, and take off-ramp automatically. It\u2019s pretty wild. It\u2019ll overtake a slow car. It\u2019s basically integrating navigation with the Autopilot capability. That\u2019s why we call it Navigate on Autopilot, or Drive on Nav.What are the challenges that you face with these technologies now, from your perspective?Well, the main challenge has been improving the neural net so that we can recognize all types of objects from all eight cameras. There are eight cameras: Three forward, two on each side, and one rear. The big challenge has been solving a wide range of corner cases. So if you have a \u2014These are things that just happen. Yeah, the roads are pretty messy, so you could have, say, skid marks on the road that look like a line. Sometimes tar seams look like a line. Sometimes the lines are just painted wrong, for some reason. One of our biggest challenges, actually, with Drive on Navigation was dealing with forks and gores, where if a lane is splitting, you need to be confident that you\u2019re going either left or right, not down the center. And the car will come to a halt at the first intersection.Now we\u2019re integrating stop signs, traffic lights, being able to do, say, hard right turns or hairpin bends and that kind of thing.What about regulations? The regulatory environment right now? Because that\u2019s gonna be part of it, or else building out infrastructure that will have sensors in roads or things like that? How do you look at that, or you\u2019re just not even thinking about it?Yeah, we\u2019re not really thinking about it. We\u2019re assuming that there won\u2019t be \u2014You\u2019re not assuming.No. The car needs to drive better than a human driver using the same inputs as a human driver. Eyes are basically just cameras. All creatures on Earth navigate with cameras. A fish eagle can see a fish from far away and take into account the refractive index of the water, dive down and get the fish from far away. There\u2019s no question that image-recognition neural nets and cameras, you can be superhuman at driving with just cameras.You don\u2019t need anything else, from the government or from infrastructure or anything. I was recently talking to the Mercedes people. They were talking about sensors in the roads.Yeah, that\u2019s hopeless. That would, at best, be a specialized solution, and whatever city puts stuff in roads ... You can always make something work for a specific solution, like some special-case solution in some town, you can make that easy, but what you really want is a general solution for self-driving that works worldwide.I\u2019d love you to sort of assess the competitive landscape. Faraday just lost another founder today, which was the hot company, or the allegedly hot company, I think that\u2019s probably easier to say it that way. Lucid got a billion dollars. How do you assess \u2014 Google\u2019s working on stuff, Uber still seems to be hanging in there. I\u2019d love to get your assessment of all of them.Yeah. I don\u2019t really think that much about competitors. I just say like, you know, how do we make our cars as good as possible? How do we make sure we have like the best engineering and manufacturing talent in the world?It\u2019s sort of like the old adage with, you know, running ... If you start looking at the other runners, it\u2019s not good, you know. Like, you can lose races because of that.Which one of them, do you think, is the furthest ahead or closest to you all?Self-driving, maybe Google, Waymo? I don\u2019t think anyone is close to Tesla in terms of achieving a general solution for working on \u2014Overall solution.Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it, but in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there\u2019s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there\u2019s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And best to my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution except ... and I think no one is likely to achieve a generalized solution to self-driving before Tesla. I could be surprised, but...So none of the car companies. None of the car companies. No.Do you ever look and go, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s interesting what they\u2019re doing there.\u201dThe other car companies ... I don\u2019t wanna sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving.You know, I think we\u2019ll get to full self-driving next year. As a generalized solution, I think. But that\u2019s a ... Like, we\u2019re on track to do that next year. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think anyone else is on track to do it next year.So the challenge you face is financial, though. Getting funding and stuff like that. And you\u2019ve gotten ... Saudis had bought a big bunch of your stock, that\u2019s just separate, they \u2014They might have sold it, I don\u2019t know.Yeah, we don\u2019t know what they have now. But where do you get the money? Talk about the finances of doing this, because that\u2019s what could really hurt you, is not having enough capital.You know ... I mean, as I said earlier this year, I think we will be cash-flow positive for all quarters going forward.All quarters going forward. So do you need more investment?No, I don\u2019t think so.Do you need to go private? Are you still contemplating that?We don\u2019t need to go private. I think we could execute better if we were private.Without all the attention?Yeah, you know, not to harp on those short-sellers, because people think I have this obsession with them, but I spent like 1 percent [or] less of time thinking about them \u2014It\u2019s the tweets, Elon. But go ahead.Less than 1 percent of my tweets have anything to do with short-sellers. But the issue is that there\u2019s a group of people who are quite smart, very mean, and have a strong financial interest in Tesla\u2019s downfall.And what that results in is a constant attack on the Tesla brand, on me personally, on the executive team, on our cars. You know, every mistake we make is amplified. Going private would definitely result in some short-term drama. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re private, and then we went public five years from now. Then the area under the curve of brand damage by short-sellers would be probably less than the short-term difficulty of going private in the first place. That was the approximate calculus. And then also being public, particularly when everyone at the company is a shareholder, causes a lot of distraction when the share price moves around a lot. It tends to end up being like a mood, to some degree, a mood thermometer. So it\u2019s like the stock goes down, people are sad and feel undercompensated. And then when the stock goes up, people are exuberant, overly exuberant, and you get distracted thinking about what you\u2019re going to buy.Right, right.So, like, neither of these things are great. When you have big moves in the stock, this just causes a distraction.Okay. All right, so last thing on this, on Tesla, these new products. The truck, the Roadster, do you have another thing you\u2019re making?Ha-ha. We definitely do.Do you have a vertical lift and takeoff?The supersonic VTOL jet, electric jet.Yeah. Perhaps a hovercraft like Larry Page, I don\u2019t know.No, hovercrafts are pretty straightforward.Yeah. Okay, sure. For you.A supersonic vertical-takeoff-and-landing electric jet would be interesting to do at some point, I think. But my head would definitely explode if I tried to do that right now.But I\u2019ve been thinking about that design for nine years. It\u2019s great.It\u2019s great? It\u2019s in your head?Yeah. I mean, I wrote down some of it, but ...But the truck is more immediate, [and] the Roadster? When do those come online? I think it\u2019s literally the most exciting product lineup of any company in the world. Certainly from a consumer standpoint. I\u2019ll just go through the things that are publicly announced.You\u2019ve got the Model Y, which is the midsize SUV. You\u2019ve got the Semi truck, which is, can be great for really heavy transport. It\u2019ll be like the heaviest class of truck, of industrial truck.We\u2019ve got the next-generation Roadster. Which will be the fastest sports car on every dimension. Fastest acceleration, fastest top speed, best handling. It\u2019s important to have an electric sports car that\u2019s faster than the fastest gasoline sports car. And it helps address that halo effect that gasoline sports cars have. So I think it\u2019s important to do that to show that, you know, electric is the best architecture.Then we\u2019ve got the pickup truck, which \u2014 actually, I\u2019m personally most excited about the pickup truck.Why\u2019s that?Well I can\u2019t talk about the details, but it\u2019s gonna be like a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, \u201cBlade Runner\u201d pickup truck. It\u2019s gonna be awesome, it\u2019s gonna be amazing. This will be heart-stopping. It stops my heart. It\u2019s like, oh, it\u2019s great.Who do you wanna sell that to? People that buy F\u2014 whatever?You know, I actually don\u2019t know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don\u2019t care.Okay.I mean I do care, eventually, you know. Like sure, I care. We wanna get gasoline, diesel pickup trucks off the road.Right.It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there\u2019s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we\u2019ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it\u2019s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.Do you have a motorcycle?No. I rode motorbikes a lot when I was a kid. So I did, like, dirt biking and then rode a motorcycle on the road. And then I almost got killed when I was 17. Most people are paralyzed, but depending on how you count it, the probability of death in a motorcycle versus \u2014It\u2019s quite high.It\u2019s 25 times higher.Yeah, my brother is a doctor. He calls them donor-mobiles, actually.Yeah. Like organ donors. So, we\u2019re not gonna make motorcycles. But a few more Tesla products that are cool: We\u2019re almost done with the development of the solar tile roof. So we have those on a few hundred roofs right now. And we\u2019re just doing testing to make sure they have long-term durability.These are tile roofs, these are tiles on the roofs? Yeah.Yeah, the solar tile roof where it looks like a normal, beautiful tile roof. But it\u2019s actually solar. And, like, that development process is longer than we\u2019d like, because we\u2019ve got to make sure that the roof\u2019s gonna stand up for 30 years.Sure.And even when you do accelerated lab testing on a solar roof, it still takes a while. And we\u2019ve gotta put a lot of work into making the installation process easy, so it doesn\u2019t take ages to install a roof.Then we\u2019ve got the Powerwall battery storage system. We\u2019ve got the Powerpack, which is used for utilities on industrial scale. We\u2019re gonna have some other exciting announcements on the stationary storage front. So when you \u2014This is within the homes?I can\u2019t talk more about it, but there\u2019s \u2014Presumably.We have a large product on the stationary storage side that I think will be very compelling for utility customers.Okay, all right. So, a Roadster. Any planes?No plans to make planes at Tesla.Well let\u2019s get to rockets, then. SpaceX. Last time we talked, you said you wanted to die on Mars, just not on landing. Which was a very funny joke, although it\u2019s probably not a joke, it\u2019s probably \u2014Well, it\u2019d be ironic if that had happened. I have to be careful about tempting fate, because I think often the most ironic outcome is the most probable.It just very often seems like reality tries to ... Actually, technically, there\u2019s a friend of mine, Jonah Nolan, who had this like modification of Occam\u2019s razor where he said he thinks \u201cthe most ironic outcome is the most likely.\u201d And then I think that there\u2019s some truth to that. And then also I think sometimes the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. Instead of discussing your death, let\u2019s discuss what\u2019s going on at SpaceX. What are some of the things you\u2019re doing?We successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the most powerful rocket in the world by a factor of two. So that\u2019s twice the power, twice the thrust of the next biggest rocket. And we actually launched a Tesla \u2014 my Tesla Roadster \u2014 to Mars orbit. The reason we did that is actually because, normally, when a new rocket is launched, you just put a dummy payload, which is like a block of concrete or something. Right. Not creative in any way.Super-boring. So we were like, okay, what is the least boring thing we can launch?And then next year, the exciting things are we\u2019re gonna be launching astronauts for the first time to the space station. It\u2019ll really be the first time a vehicle from the United States launches astronauts into orbit since the Space Shuttle, which \u2014Which has been some years, right?2010 or something like that? Since then, the United States has relied upon the Russian Soyuz, which actually recently has had some issues. What do you think of the Space Force? The Trump Space Force?Well, this may be a little controversial, but I actually like the idea. I think it\u2019s cool. You know, like, when the Air Force was formed, there was a lot of like pooh-poohing, and like, \u201cOh, how silly to have an Air Force!\u201d You know, because the aircraft in World War II were managed by the Army.Right.And so you had the Army and the Navy and the Coast Guard and the Marines, and then ... it became pretty obvious that you really needed a specialized division to manage aircraft. And so the Air Force was created.And people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone\u2019s like, \u201cObviously, you should have an Air Force.\u201d And I think it\u2019s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too.Out there, to do what?You know, it\u2019s basically defense in space. And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization ... You know, expanding things beyond Earth.I think we could just have a base on the moon, for example. A base on Mars. Be great to expand on the idea of a Space Force. Anyone who has an exploratory spirit, and I think that especially applies to a country like the United States, where you know it\u2019s kind of the distillation of the spirit of human exploration. I think the idea of being out there among the stars and among the planets is very exciting.All right. And, Mars. Last time we talked, it was 2024, was it? That you talked about getting there?Yeah, we\u2019re still aiming for 2024.Okay. And you going? Or someone going?I don\u2019t know if I will go or not. It may be just an unmanned mission, you know. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019ll be people onboard or not.But there is a Mars rendezvous opportunity, \u2019cause you can only do a launch to Mars roughly every two years. So around the 2024 timeframe, there\u2019s a rendezvous opportunity for Mars, which hopefully we can catch. There\u2019s one in 2022 \u2014So an unmanned flight to Mars?Hopefully, there are people on board. But I think there\u2019s a pretty good chance of at least having an unmanned craft go to Mars. I think we will try to do this.Do you think NASA should continue to exist, or all these space agencies by the government? Yeah, I certainly think NASA should continue to exist, NASA does a lot of really useful things, and these go beyond astronaut transport. There are missions to rovers on Mars that are thanks to NASA. There are these planetary probes, there\u2019s the Hubble Telescope. NASA does a tremendous amount of good, and ideally we should actually increase the budget of NASA. I think it\u2019s high time that we went beyond Earth orbit again. I think it\u2019s very exciting and inspiring, and I think it really gets the whole world fired up.When the first humans stepped foot on the Moon, it was probably the most inspiring thing, maybe in history? We should try to do more of that stuff.How do you look at what [Jeff] Bezos is doing with Blue Origin, because I suppose that\u2019s the most comparable private thing going on?Yeah, I think it\u2019s great that Jeff is spending lots of money on space. I think it will encounter some challenges getting to orbit; it\u2019s remarkably difficult getting to orbit. But he has the resources to overcome those difficulties. He\u2019s got some spare change in the couch, I think.You\u2019re not buying a newspaper, are you?No, I don\u2019t generally acquire things.Yeah, just curious.I create companies, but I don\u2019t really acquire them. So I wouldn\u2019t ... I have no plans. It does seem to be popular these days.So let\u2019s finish up the last two things. Boring Company, I was just with Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles \u2014Oh, great, yeah. Eric\u2019s been a great supporter.Yeah, he has. He says, \u201cAnything to cut traffic.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care. I was like, \u201cWhy do you think these people are interested in traffic so much?\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause no matter how rich you are, everybody can get caught in traffic. And so they just want to do something about it.\u201dYeah, Eric\u2019s been really supportive of our activity in L.A. I mean, technically, our first tunnels are in Hawthorne. But we do expect to, over time, create a network of tunnels under greater L.A. And I think this is really the key to getting around the city very fast. You\u2019ve got to go 3-D. Our offices are 3-D and dense, but we then have a 2-D road transport network.So you\u2019re thinking all around, lots of roads within the tunnels?Yeah, many levels of tunnels, so \u2014Right, like a subway system?Yeah, but even subways tend to be essentially two-dimensional. You\u2019ll have a subway cross another subway, but they\u2019ve never really tried to make many layers of subways. The cost of tunneling, historically, has been prohibitive. And they\u2019ve also been incredibly slow. The typical cost for a subway, per-mile cost for a subway in the U.S. has been about a billion dollars a mile, so that is not a very scalable solution.So tunnels?You could certainly have a subway system which had many layers of tunnels, but the tunnels are so prohibitively expensive that they don\u2019t do it. But you can go down 100 levels if you want to; you could have 100 layers of tunnels on top of each other. You can go further down than you can go up. So the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. But, really, the key is a massive improvement in tunneling technology. That\u2019s the linchpin, that\u2019s fundamentally what it amounts to. And as I got sort of digging into tunnels ... Ha-ha, good one.Do you say that? Please don\u2019t do that, you need to stop. Is that how you amuse yourself?Yeah, yeah, no, I\u2019ve got a million of \u2019em.\u201cDigging in?\u201dTunnels are really so underappreciated. They have no place to go but down.Oh my god. All right, okay. These are dad jokes, you know that?I am a dad, so \u2014I\u2019m glad you\u2019re amused with yourself, go ahead.No, no, it\u2019s a terrible habit. I laugh at my own jokes, even with the terrible ones. So, what I discovered is that there are massive improvements possible in tunneling technology.When will one be useful? The Hawthorne one, it\u2019s a test tunnel?Yeah, we\u2019re about to finish the first test tunnel.At what cost?I don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s probably ... Excluding the equipment, probably cost us $10 million for a mile. It\u2019s one-way, admittedly, but \u2014So when will people be able to use it, actually use it?We\u2019re planning on having an opening party on Dec. 10th, in six weeks.One thing I didn\u2019t ask: When you had been looking to go private with Tesla, you had talked to the Saudis. How do you feel about them now? I ask every internet executive this now, given the amount of money they have in the system.Yeah, well I mean, it\u2019s important to appreciate that the Saudis have been approaching me for two years about going private. It wasn\u2019t like spur-of-the-moment.But I\u2019m talking about in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s murder.Yeah, I mean, that sounds pretty bad. So ... that is not good. That is bad.That is bad.That was really bad, it was really \u2014Would you take their money now?I think we probably would not, yes.Okay, and what about their influence in Silicon Valley, given the billions that are being poured in here?I know I can\u2019t speak to that, I mean, it\u2019s not ... Saudi Arabia\u2019s an entire country, so I think you don\u2019t want to, if there\u2019s one really bad thing that occurred, nail down the whole country, it\u2019s not great.It\u2019s their ruler.Sure.It\u2019s their ruler, it\u2019s the guy who runs everything.They didn\u2019t elect him, you know?No, they didn\u2019t, that\u2019s right. No, I get that, I\u2019m not impugning all Saudis, but it is the government.I think we should just consider that there is a whole country, and there\u2019s, you know ... There are a lot of good people in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis who are outside of Saudi Arabia. So I think you cannot paint an entire country with one brush.No, no, I\u2019m just talking about the people who have the money.I think there are serious issues, it\u2019s not good.And what about the techlash itself? You had been a critic of how \u2014 the responsibility around AI, around diversity of AI. About the power that\u2019s held by Facebook and Google and others, in previous interviews we\u2019ve done. How do you look at that now?It probably makes sense if something is responsible for a public good, and could potentially negatively affect elections or something like that, that there probably should be some regulatory oversight to ensure that we\u2019re not negatively affecting the democratic process. That the quality of news is good and not unduly influenced. These seem like sensible things.At the time we\u2019d talked a couple years ago, you were worried about the power that Google and Facebook were assembling in AI, and you were worried about AI itself. And I think one of the things that you had said that really struck me was that it wasn\u2019t going to kill us, it would treat us like house cats. I thought that was a really striking way to think about it.In the long term, as AI gets probably much smarter than humans, the relative intelligence ratio is probably similar to that between a person and a cat, maybe bigger. I do think we need to be very careful about the advancement of AI and \u2014And you\u2019re still worried about it in that way?My recommendation for the longest time has been consistent. I think we ought to have a government committee that starts off with insight, gaining insight. Spends a year or two gaining insight about AI or other technologies that are maybe dangerous, but especially AI. And then, based on that insight, comes up with rules in consultation with industry that give the highest probability for a safe advent of AI.You think that \u2014 do you see that happening?I do not.How are you feeling about the future, when what appears to be reality ...?For some reason, I feel optimistic. And I\u2019m not sure if that is irrational or not.Does this polarization affect you? You\u2019ve pulled yourself off the Trump councils, I know you and I talked about whether ... I said you shouldn\u2019t go, \u2019cause he was gonna screw you, remember? Well, you were right.I am right, thank you, Elon. I know that. But you feel, in the midst of this polarization, these bombings, the president continually being divisive, you feel optimistic?Yeah. By the way, I still think it was worth trying to be on the Trump councils, and especially just to be an advocate for climate, I did my absolute best.Yes, I know you did. I think I called you, I think I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not Jesus, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201dI definitely do not think I am Jesus.No, I know you don\u2019t. I think I was just trying to egg you into getting off the councils.Arguably, it was unlikely, but it was worth a shot, yeah.Right, would you do it again?Do you mean now, or ...?Yeah.I don\u2019t know, are there councils?No. But you\u2019re optimistic, given all this polarization? Are you thinking about the midterm elections?I am thinking about the midterm elections, and I did vote, by the way.Me, too. Today.Though I do wonder what effect a vote in California has. There\u2019s so much gerrymandering of electoral districts that it seems like ... I voted for the sake of voting, but things are very divisive right now, politically. But it\u2019s probably not wise for me to wade into political debates, it\u2019s a no-win situation.Right, I got it. But how do you feel \u2014 as a citizen, how do you feel?I definitely wish people wouldn\u2019t yell at each other quite so much, I wish there was less hate.Right, okay, my last question. If you had to redo anything this year, Elon, what would it be? It\u2019s fair to say I would probably not have tweeted some of the things I tweeted, that was probably unwise. And probably not gotten into some of the online fights that I got into. I probably shouldn\u2019t have attacked journalists, probably shouldn\u2019t have done that.I don\u2019t know why you do it.Yes.Yeah, do you want to say you\u2019re sorry? You can if you want.I\u2019m sorry to some journalists.Okay, I\u2019ll give you that, I\u2019ll give you that. Okay, I\u2019ll give you that. Elon, podcast secured.Thank you, Kara. It was great to see you.It\u2019s been a really fascinating discussion, and I will think about buying an electric car, probably not. I mean, why not?Make a scooter. Make a scooter and I\u2019ll go for it. They actually are electric, what am I talking about? I don\u2019t know, there was some people in the studio who wanted to make a scooter, but I was like, \u201cUh, no.\u201dI love the scooter, no, get on the scooter.It lacks dignity.No, it doesn\u2019t lack dignity.Yes, they do.They don\u2019t lack dignity, what are you talking about?Have you tried driving one of those things? They \u2014Yes, I do it all the time, I look fantastic.They do not, you are laboring under an illusion.All right, well, everybody at Lime, don\u2019t worry, Elon Musk is not coming for you.Electric bike. I think we might do an electric bike, yeah.All right, perhaps. All right, Elon Musk, thank you very much. I appreciate it.That was a pleasure, thank you. It was good to see you.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.A Verge affiliate site"}
