{"id": "Airbnb is donating $5 million toward helping the homeless in San Francisco", "paragraph": "Airbnb is making its biggest donation yet in its hometown \u2014 $5 million \u2014 toward helping address the homelessness crisis in San Francisco. The announcement comes at a time when politicians and social justice organizations are increasingly calling upon tech companies to give more to the city where they created their wealth. Last week, San Franciscans voted to pass a \u201chomelessness tax\u201d \u2014 Prop C \u2014 on large corporations in the city.The issue has divided the tech community. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff helped bring national attention to Prop C by sparring on Twitter with tech CEOs such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in defense of the measure, and accusing some San Francisco billionaires of hoarding their wealth instead of opening their pocketbooks to help the city\u2019s most needy.While Airbnb has taken no official stance on Prop C, the donation is a sign that the company is willing to publicly commit to a bigger role in helping out on the issue.\u201cWe are proud to call this city our home, and we know we have a deep responsibility to step up and help find solutions to some of our hometown\u2019s most pressing issues, including homelessness,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post this morning.It\u2019s a far cry from what some called a tone-deaf attitude a few years back, when the company ran a \u201cDear San Francisco\u201d ad campaign telling the city how to spend the taxes it collects from the company.Airbnb has yet to announce the specifics about how it will distribute the funds, but the  company has talked with organizations and leaders such as Benioff and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and nonprofits The Tipping Point Foundation and Hamilton House, according to a spokesperson for Airbnb.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
