{"id": "Washington pummels Facebook: \u2018Big tech can no longer be trusted\u2019", "paragraph": "Facebook is, once again, a political pi\u00f1ata.In the aftermath of a New York Times story that meticulously revealed Facebook\u2019s cloddish response to the disinformation and hacking campaigns around the 2016 election, the company is battling renewed criticism from Washington, D.C. \n    Related\n  It\u2019s not like Facebook has had much of a break \u2014 though after both Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg testified extensively before Congress, you might think that the company\u2019s brass had lowered the temperature from its Washington critics. But as the company\u2019s internal deliberations become public, it\u2019s getting harder for Facebook to present the \u201ceverything is fine\u201d messaging on Capitol Hill.The toughest pummeling came from Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who said the story was a \u201cchilling reminder that big tech can no longer be trusted.\u201d\u201cYesterday, we learned that when Mark Zuckerberg told the American people that Russian interference was a \u2018pretty crazy idea,\u2019 he knew this was flatly untrue,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cRather than take responsibility for a profound breach of trust, Facebook executives for months sought to withhold significant information and deflect criticism. Worse, in its evasion, Facebook hired toxic political operators that sought to mislead the public and disparage critics of the company.\u201dMark Warner, a loud Facebook critic as the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, took a little victory lap on Thursday, saying that his committee\u2019s work is to thank for exposing Facebook\u2019s problems in the first place.\u201cThe New York Times story reinforces the fact that, but for consistent pressure brought to bear by the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s bipartisan investigation, we would still be in the dark about the extent of Russian activity on Facebook during the 2016 election,\u201d Warner said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say that the cooperation has improved significantly, but what\u2019s evident from the story is that for a long period of months, the company hoped this problem would simply just go away.\u201dBen Sasse, a Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, interrogated Zuckerberg during his Capitol Hill visit. Here\u2019s how Sasse reacted to the Times story:\u201cInstead of turning this into another lazy debate about the left, the right, and the 2016 election, Silicon Valley and Washington should be working to combat the very real threat that information operations can pour gasoline on nearly every culture war that divides the American people,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cFacebook needs to stop treating this like a PR crisis and Washington needs to stop treating this like a partisan opportunity \u2014 this is a real national security threat.\u201d Several Senate Democrats appear to have in their crosshairs an opposition-research company, Definers Public Affairs, that Facebook reportedly hired to spread dirt on its competitors. Warner\u2019s colleague on the committee, Amy Klobuchar, led a group of Democrats who sent a letter to the Department of Justice to see if Facebook broke any campaign-finance rules with this arrangement, among other requests.\u201cWe write to urge that you expand any investigation into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to include whether Facebook \u2014 or any other entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook \u2014 retaliated against critics or public officials seeking to regulate the platform, or hid vital information from the public,\u201d wrote Klobuchar alongside Blumenthal, Sen. Mazie Hirono and Sen. Chris Coons.The Times reported that Definers tried to cast the criticism of the company as pushed by George Soros, a prominent Jewish, liberal philanthropist. Senate Democrat Ron Wyden keyed in on that part, and was harsh.\u201cIndividuals that promote anti-Semitic bile, like Definers, and the people at Facebook who hired them, threaten not just our safety, but our democracy,\u201d Wyden tweeted. \u201cFacebook has not only refused to effectively crack down on hate-spewing Nazis, the New York Times revealed it actually encouraged anti-Semitism by hiring degenerate right-wing propagandists to concoct conspiracies that tap into anti-Semitic biases.\u201dSo what happens now? Wyden is calling for the Senate to adopt new privacy rules that he has pushed after saying: \u201cA corporation that stoops this low in response to legitimate criticism should not be trusted with your personal information.\u201dAnd Scott Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, reiterated his call for Zuckerberg to step down as the chairman of Facebook\u2019s board of directors: \u201cRenegade executives who are focused only on growth regardless of the risks \u2014 and withhold information from the board \u2014 put their company, shareholders, and in Facebook\u2019s case, our democracy in jeopardy.\u201dBut don\u2019t expect that to happen. If history is any guide, Facebook will keep plowing ahead, Washington will keep slapping it around, and few of the fundamentals will change.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
