{"id": "Full Q&A: \u2018Good and Mad\u2019 author Rebecca Traister on Recode Decode", "paragraph": "New York magazine writer Rebecca Traister, the author of a new book about women\u2019s anger called \u201cGood and Mad,\u201d says it is way, way too soon to pat ourselves on the back for the gains of the #MeToo movement.\u201cI don\u2019t see any of this ending in our lifetimes,\u201d Traister said on the latest episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should. This has been centuries behind us, and it\u2019s centuries ahead of us, and the aberration and the error was in not being mad all the time, being somehow convinced that we didn\u2019t have anything to be mad about.\u201d\u201cWhatever happens in the midterms, whatever happens in 2020, this is not fixed with an election,\u201d she added. \u201c... In so many ways it\u2019s so much easier to think of this as a story about individual bad people, and individual politicians, and if we could just get rid of Donald Trump or just get rid of Harvey Weinstein or Les Moonves, we\u2019ll solve the problem, when the real project ahead of us is remaking the entire system. And that is a project that will extend well beyond our lifetimes, but to which we must all commit.\u201dTraister said there\u2019s a long, clear history women using their anger to change culture and policy, some of which has been whitewashed by those who ostensibly agree with the outcome. And when people lose their historical memory for the slow, often frustrating pace of social change, they can feel burned out by setbacks.But whether #MeToo supporters are hitting the history books or hitting the streets to protest, Traister said there\u2019s one \u201cuniversal\u201d thing they all can do to avoid burnout.\u201cHere\u2019s the solution to exhaustion, is you become part of a group and a network where, when you need to take care of yourself, you can and know that you are connected to people who are doing the work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you tell those people when they need to take a break and take care of themselves. That\u2019s the solution. The exhaustion comes when we\u2019re on our own and feeling alone and driven into this fury, and then there\u2019s no-one to rely on for support or help.\u201dYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Rebecca.Kara Swisher: Today in the Red Chair is Rebecca Traister, a fantastic writer for New York Magazine, one of my favorites, and The Cut. She\u2019s also the author of a new book called \u201cGood and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women\u2019s Anger.\u201d Rebecca, this is a very good day to talk.Rebecca Traister: Very good day, very bad day.Very bad day. Welcome to Recode Decode.Thanks for having me.So I want to talk about your book and your background. But I do want to get into today. This is just a disturbing day for the media and others. And there\u2019s a lot of rage going around and obviously these pipe bombs are being found all over the place, aimed at Democrats, essentially. And you have a president responding.And the media.And the media, and the president responding saying it\u2019s their fault or that they did it to themselves or something like that. And so I\u2019m really kind of irritated right now, I\u2019m particularly irritated. And also because it all falls into this stuff.But let\u2019s talk a little bit about your background, how you got to this. I like to know what people have done and how they get places. So give us a little bit of your background of how you got to this topic and writing in general.Well I didn\u2019t have any particular grand plan to become a journalist. It always felt like a very glamorous career. I grew up the daughter of academics, and the idea of writing something and putting my name on it and getting paid for it was basically the equivalent of being a movie star. And I didn\u2019t go to journalism school. I went to Northwestern, which has an incredible journalism school.It does, it does.But I did not go to Medill. I got a degree in American Studies. I studied literature. And then when I came to New York after college, I actually worked for ... my first job was for an actor, as an assistant. I thought maybe I would work in the movies.How did that go?It was a personal assistant job.Yeah, yeah, exactly.It was a lot of coffee and a lot of delivered expensive sushi and some crazy travel with famous people. And then in my mid-20s I got a job as an assistant at a magazine that was being edited by Tina Brown and that was being funded by Harvey Weinstein.Oh yeah.Talk Magazine.Talk Magazine, oh man.And I was a secretary there. I was the secretary to the number two editor.That must have been a ride.It was, I was there ... almost my entire tenure there was before it launched.Oh, wow.I quit very quickly after the first issue. So it was like a year of preparing to publish a magazine.That must have been a hot mess.Ohh.Hot mess is how I\u2019d...I met a lot of really good friends there. And I actually, that\u2019s where I met journalists, the young writers and editors who worked there [were] so talented. And they encouraged me to think about becoming a journalist myself.Right.And helped me to get a job as a fact checker and a reporter at the New York Observer, which is a weekly newspaper. And when I was there, I was taught sort of the very nuts and bolts of how to be a reporter. And I was put on all kinds of beats that I didn\u2019t much care about, real estate sales and the gossip column. But I learned how to meet a deadline, and how to write a lede. And I always had feminist politics, I grew up in a home that was political. My father came from a super left New York family. His relatives had been party leaders in the mid-20th century. And my mom came from a Republican household but had turned left.So I always had left politics, and I was particularly interested as a student in various kinds of inequality \u2014 gender inequality, racial inequity, and how they shaped literature.And social justice.And social justice. But it wasn\u2019t quite ... I wasn\u2019t an activist. I don\u2019t quite know how to describe it. On campus, I never took part in a Take Back the Night march, which was happening a little bit on my campus in the 90s. I was not an activist by any stretch of the imagination. I often wonder, if I could go back and ask myself\u2026. I knew no one called themselves a feminist. I was in a million classrooms where people would make an observation that began with, \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but ... \u201c It was deep anti-feminist backlash time. I wish I could go back and actually know the answer to the question of would I have actually called myself a feminist then? I don\u2019t know whether I would have.And you certainly didn\u2019t object to those.No. I was feminist in my curiosity and in how I read the literature that I was studying. But I don\u2019t know how ... I was just not an activist feminist by any stretch of the imagination. But I had curiosities and about gender, but I couldn\u2019t have imagined making it a career. And then I got a job at Salon, the online magazine. And it was writing a sort of squishy section about \u201cwomen\u2019s stuff,\u201d like sex or education. It could have been anything, just what used to be called \u201cThe Mothers Who Think\u201d column. And I started to write from a sort of rudimentary feminist point of view. And this was in 2003, 2004. And those pieces started to get readers, which then there was an incentive for my bosses to have me keep writing from a feminist perspective. So I got to develop a beat. And I became a feminist journalist. A lot of ...Were you following in anyone\u2019s footsteps? I mean Gloria Steinem was a feminist journalism. You remember the Playboy piece?Absolutely. There had been a very robust feminist media through the 70s. And there had been ... Katha Pollitt was writing feminism in The Nation throughout that deep backlash period, where basically there wasn\u2019t anybody else. Ellen Goodman, to a certain extent.But she was cute.Anna Quindlen. That stuff wasn\u2019t, except for Katha, who was super feminist, in mainstream press, there wasn\u2019t like a politicized feminism.As it had been before.As it had been before, through the 80s and 90s, that had sort of disappeared. The notion of a feminist media that is now, for anybody listening now, they\u2019re like, \u201cSure, there\u2019s a feminist media. There\u2019s a feminist blogosphere, there\u2019s a feminist \u2026\u201d You know. That was not ...There was one, and then there wasn\u2019t one.And then there wasn\u2019t one for a long time. And so this was a period in which ...Actually, it was very similar, what happened to gay publications. There was a whole bunch of gay, like Advocate and everything else because there was nowhere to go. And then the mainstream media subsumed all of that stuff. So it was present, but not heavily present.Right. And there was a feminism on the margins. There was a zine culture, there was a music culture, riot grrrl feminism, but it was not anywhere near a mainstream set of media or pop culture, for a long time. But about the time that I started experimenting, writing basically pop culture criticism from a feminist perspective, there were other people, other journalists my age, I think there was that sense, it was like a generation that hadn\u2019t lived through the post-movement vilification of whatever disruptions you\u2019d made. And it was like, there was a sort of hunger to like, wait, can we go back to talking about this now?Right.And that was happening, I was doing it, but there were also dozens of other people doing it. Some of them coming out of activist spheres, out of the Dean campaign and the netroots stuff in 2004 came a lot of women who were irritated by gender politics on the left. So that was the sort of moment that the feminist blogosphere, as it was then called, sort of blossomed. And those were the years during which I first started developing my beat. And it was a lot of pop culture criticism, and then ...What were you aiming to do? What was the goal for you?I wish that I had had a cogent kind sort of vision of what I was trying to do. I felt it was exhilarating because it was like I could look... It was a great freedom of getting to make my own beat, and getting to decide what I got to write about and then considering it through a feminist lens. Now obviously, especially at the beginning, I hadn\u2019t been schooled in any of this stuff. I actually hadn\u2019t taken Women\u2019s Studies classes, I didn\u2019t know much about social history in the United States, I really didn\u2019t. And so a lot of the stuff that I wrote then was quite blinkered, with regards to gender and race and class.What do you mean?It was very rudimentary stuff. I didn\u2019t take ... there was no history, there was no texture. It was kind of like, \u201cWell, this seems sexist!\u201d I don\u2019t mean to \u2026 some of it was smart! I\u2019m not a stupid person. But it was totally unschooled. It had none of what I aim to do now, 15 years later, which is trying to tell a bigger story.\u201dThat seems sexist!\u201dRight. Seriously, that was a lot of ....\u201cPantyhose!\u201dRight! \u201cHigh heels, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d It was like the Seinfeld routine of feminism. It wasn\u2019t quite that bad, but it was very, there wasn\u2019t a sense of this stuff that had come before. For example, you say, \u201cOh, well Gloria Steinem was doing this kind of stuff. This is what Ms. Magazine was.\u201d Well I hadn\u2019t, at that point, I knew what Ms Magazine was, but I hadn\u2019t read those stories. And one of the things that happens, and this is not within lots of social movements, that sort of get pushback in a backlash and then get revivified by another generation. The generation that emerges doesn\u2019t know that the people have been there 30 years before. And I think that\u2019s okay, by the way, and I think there are frustrations, that\u2019s part of what leads to generational frustration. But by the way, there\u2019s a certain exhilaration in thinking you\u2019re discovering something for the first time that can hook you into these ideas. You don\u2019t necessarily come into these things wanting to say like, \u201cWell, my foremothers were writing these exact same sentences.\u201dAnd let\u2019s go all the way back to the Declaration of Sentiments, perhaps.Yes. That\u2019s a pretty good document.Right. And in fact, in the book I just published, one of the most moving pieces of journalism that I came across was one by Vivian Gornick, the brilliant writer and essayist. And she was writing in the 1990s, looking back and having been part of that second wave in the 1970s. And talking about the exhilaration that she felt reading some of the suffragists and abolitionists when she was a young feminist in the 70s, and thinking \u201cOh my God, these people, they\u2019re saying what we were saying a hundred years ago!\u201d And she writes about how it was thrilling, but that it wasn\u2019t yet sobering. And that it should have been sobering. And of course, the reason that it should have been sobering is because it was like, wait, if people were saying this a hundred years ago, and we\u2019re still saying it today, then something happened in those intervening hundred years where we didn\u2019t get to the promised land.Yeah, exactly. Absolutely. They were quite woke back then.Yeah. Well, about some things. They were very racist, in ways we\u2019re still ... those are the long-term...Issues, absolutely. Between people of color and women of color.Right. The inequities that have marked really every progressive coalition and that are very damaging to them. And #MeToo.I mean, everything. But anyway, the early work was very much just a thrill at getting to like ... honestly, and a lot of it was this pop culture stuff, a lot of it was like \u201cBritney Spears cut all her hair off, and it\u2019s a tabloid story, but wait a minute, I think this actually has \u2026\u201dBigger repercussions.Well yeah. And there\u2019s something about a pattern around gender and power and remaking oneself and the power to control your own image. I don\u2019t even remember what I wrote about that. But that was the sort of initial entry point is like, \u201cWait, I could look at the world through these glasses and see it in a way that I don\u2019t think is being talked about enough.\u201d And that was true. It was really kind of a desert out there.Now, of course, that sort of, \u201cLet\u2019s look at this from a gendered perspective, or a perspective that takes into account inequalities,\u201d there\u2019s much more of that all around us.In fact, it\u2019s woven through stuff. Exactly, exactly. But that wasn\u2019t really true 15 years ago.Right. So, the book. It\u2019s kind of a perfect storm, it\u2019s a terrible storm right now, of anger and rage, which had been building.Yeah.Which, it happened in the 70s too. It happened in Elizabeth Cady Stanton\u2019s time.Yeah, it has to build to a boiling point. And especially when it comes ... the book is about women\u2019s anger about all kinds of injustice. So it\u2019s about women who exploded with anger over racial injustice and violence and how their anger, in fact, was catalytic to a civil rights movement, to the abolition movement, to the gay rights movement. But when it comes specifically to women\u2019s anger at gender inequality, there\u2019s a specific structural thing that makes it hard and makes it one of the reasons it only happens every 50 or 60 years. Because if you\u2019re going to get angry about gendered inequality, because women are a majority population, an oppressed majority, which is a rare and delicate thing, it means that every woman has men in her life and every man has women in his life. And that means that the people you\u2019re identifying as your oppressors are the people with whom you have some of your most intimate relationships. Familial, your fathers, your brothers, your friends, your, in many cases, your lovers or your partners, your sons. And that intimacy and the fact that to challenge the power dynamic in those relationships means disturbing the nature of those relationships makes it an incredibly heavy lift and hard to get a mass number of women angry enough that they\u2019re willing to sort of wreak that havoc on their personal and their professional and therefore economic lives.I get it, I have two sons.Right.I am always saying like, \u201cOh, mediocre men.\u201d And my son\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s sexist.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah. But it\u2019s true.\u201dRight. This is one of the things I hear all the time is, \u201cMy sons.\u201d From all kinds of angles. This is hard, hard emotional work to bring a social justice movement into your own family. No, absolutely. I\u2019m always like, \u201cNot you. But the rest of them.\u201dRight, right. And then you\u2019re like, \u201cBut you\u2026 ?\u201d Like what is ... and me, and what is my role here, and what is, you know \u2026 ?Yeah, I\u2019m often saying, I go, I sometimes say, \u201cAll men,\u201d and then my son goes, \u201cNot all men!\u201d And I\u2019ll be like, \u201cOf course it\u2019s not.\u201d You say it off the top of your head. And I go, \u201cMany men.\u201d And then I have to correct myself and say, \u201cMost.\u201d And then I\u2019m like, it fascinates me. So it led to the book, and we\u2019re going to get into more details in doing this. You thought it deserved more.Well it was like that initial lens that I had that I could look at the world and think about it with regard to gendered inequality.Right.There was a kind of revelation I had between the 2016 election and the beginning of 2017 that was like, \u201cOh my God, anger.\u201d Wait, I knew anger had always undergirded,  I wouldn\u2019t have written about this stuff if I hadn\u2019t been angry about the inequalities. Right.But I\u2019d never thought of anger as a motivating factor. I think in many ways, women are trained not to consider their own anger, to distance themselves from it, to not focus on it, to obscure it. But I could see it, in the years I\u2019d been doing this writing and learning some of the history that I\u2019d never been taught, and also looking around at the world as it is and what needs to happen as we move forward, I was like, \u201cWait. Anger is a thread that connects all this stuff I\u2019ve been learning and thinking about and reconsidering.\u201d And in fact, it\u2019s a thing we\u2019re not supposed to look directly at, if we\u2019re women. So that was the sort of motivating idea behind the book.I agree. I think that\u2019s what changed the gay rights movement, anger. Backed up. They were right. Everyone was like, \u201cWhoa, careful, let\u2019s get along, let\u2019s compromise.\u201d And I kept thinking, no, that\u2019s exactly what has to happen, the only way it\u2019s going to make change is by being angry. And they changed everything. Not the compromisers. The compromisers did not do it. It was the angry people.In the book, this is what I write about chaos. And one of the fears about anger, especially from people who have less power, and therefore when they challenge ... anger coming from the powerful to the less powerful isn\u2019t chaos. That\u2019s how power works, right? That\u2019s police killings. That\u2019s not chaos, that\u2019s control. But when people have less power challenge the power system, it becomes chaotic and scary. But act up is a perfect example of that, and I write in the book about Stonewall. And that was also a moment ...No, we say no anymore.\u201cI\u2019m angry, I\u2019m going to throw something.\u201d But if you do that, and you\u2019re the person who has less power, that\u2019s how you get characterized as a mob. As a riot.Right. And we\u2019re going to talk about that, as \u201cmobs not jobs,\u201d I am literally livid right now, I could tell you so many things. Why now has this happened? You\u2019ve written this book to talk about this and what it does, and the power of anger and how it creates chaos and also social change.Well I think that the anger had been building. And it had been building before the 2016 election. There was this period, the 80s, Reagan, the 90s, the Clintons, the Bush ...I\u2019m still mad about the Reagan administration, just so you know.Well, you should be. Because part of what happened is in the wake of those late 20th century, disruptive, chaotic social movements, right? Where people who had historically been barred from certain kinds of power stage mass movements to disrupt and change the way the systems worked. And so you had a civil rights movement, a gay rights movement, a women\u2019s movement in the 60s and 70s that changed the laws, changed the norms, changed the assumptions. And, dramatically in many ways, though [they] did not fix them, altered the ways that institutions worked. The ways that political and educational and economic structures were composed and who could participate in them and who deserved protection under them, right? And that was an extremely chaotic period in the United States.And because, ultimately, it did not stop the United States from being a white patriarchy, where, you know, power was still aligned to white people in the United States and men had still a significantly higher share of it. There was a kind of retraction after that chaos. And what we call in feminism, Susan Faludi wrote the book called \u201cBacklash.\u201d It was the post-feminist backlash period, during which, part of the work of backlash and quelling that chaos and stopping the disruption was in vilifying those who had caused it, which is where you get all the bad stereotypes about angry men hating sexless, humorless feminists.You know the joke, I hate to quote a Roseanne Barr joke, but it\u2019s a good one.Which one?She has, I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s like man-hating lesbians and stuff like that, and she goes, \u201cI don\u2019t know why they think lesbians hate men. They don\u2019t have to sleep with them.\u201d That\u2019s a good one.That\u2019s a good joke. Roseanne used to be like a ...She used to be funny.She used to be, and she used to be like a-Now she\u2019s real mad.And she\u2019s so mad. Yeah.Or something else. So but the other part of that is telling people that, \u201cOh, you fixed it all. We\u2019re post-race, we\u2019re post-feminism.\u201d There\u2019s nothing left to be angry about, right? If you\u2019re still angry about inequality, then you\u2019re somehow theatrical. You\u2019re borrowing your outrage from another era, right?Right.And this is a myth ... America, and especially the people who have the most access to power, the white middle class, is most likely to be the storytellers, to control the cultural narratives, the pop cultural narratives, the political stories. The politicians are all like to be people who, themselves, are insulated from some of the effects of what was always pernicious-Right. They have no idea.... and continuing inequality, right? And so they could tell themselves, in part to preserve their own continued power, there\u2019s nothing left to be-Well, because they aren\u2019t being attacked ever. They had no idea.Right. Right. And they didn\u2019t want to have it. It\u2019s not just that they have no idea. It\u2019s that you have no-That\u2019s an interesting question, because when you think about a lot of the stuff that\u2019s going around, #MeToo ... We cover it from Silicon Valley\u2019s perspective, and we had covered the Ellen Pao trial, and we\u2019d covered Susan Fowler at Uber and stuff like that where that was that manifestation of it. That was the tech manifestation of it. And I always think women had 10 stories like this, everybody, and they ranged from very minor ... They weren\u2019t minor. None of them were minor like \u201csweetie\u201d and that kind of stuff, to the very disturbing, really sexual assault, essentially. And every woman had 10 stories like that somewhere along that continuum, and every man was surprised by it. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize. It was fascinating! I had no idea.\u201dWe just had such a ... I\u2019ve thought about this a lot, because there was this period right before the 2016 election, this kind of the amnesia. The degree to which people who don\u2019t experience it don\u2019t want to think about how ubiquitous these kinds of inequities are. So right before the 2016 election, after the Access Hollywood tape, there\u2019s this period that we\u2019ve kind of forgotten-This is the Trump ...Yeah, after the release of the Access Hollywood tape and then women coming forward with their names. The People reporter, the woman on the airplane telling stories about how Trump had groped or assaulted them. And there was this outpouring. It was a hashtag campaign. It was millions of women telling stories, and I had conversations that fall, that month, leading up to the election in 2016, with men saying, \u201cI had no idea.\u201d A senator said to me, \u201cMy wife got groped on the subway,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOf course she got groped on the subway. We all get groped on the subway. How is this a surprise to you?\u201d And men saying, \u201cI had no idea. My eyes are open. I had no idea how frequent this was.\u201d Okay, and I was like, \u201cWow, maybe men are really seeing.\u201d A year later, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein reporting, there is the #MeToo movement, which of course is a later iteration of Tarana Burke\u2019s \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, which she founded and led in 2006 and on. And during that moment, I have all these conversations with men who are like, \u201cOh, my God. I had no idea how common this was!\u201d And I was like, \u201cBut we did just talk about this a year ago, right?\u201dYeah.And then this summer and fall during Christine Blasey-Ford, when you had a whole new batch of women, many of them in that case actually older women, talking about-What happened.... you know, what they\u2019d experienced in high school-Happened to me. ... and college.Happened to everybody.Again, of course, it happened to everybody. But I also had all these conversations with men being like, \u201cI just had no idea,\u201d and I was like, \u201cYou guys! We have now talked about this three times! How can you ...\u201d First of all, we don\u2019t want to think about the things that are hard, which is also ties into the answer of how could people who don\u2019t have to be angry because they have certain comforts and privileges, how are they anesthetized to not feel the anger, to not see the inequality? It\u2019s because it\u2019s easier, and we know from the way people talk now, like, \u201cCan\u2019t we just go back to when Twitter was about bad TV?\u201d There\u2019s a desire to go back to a point where we\u2019re not in the midst of a fight for the country\u2019s soul, where we\u2019re not in the midst of a fight where we\u2019re likely to suffer horrible, depressing, terrifying defeats, where we don\u2019t have to look straight every day at the kind of violence and suffering that has always been right there, but there were not circumstances that forced us to look at it. Right?Exactly.And but it\u2019s that desire that\u2019s so dangerous. That desire, which is natural and human-Was to let it go away.... was to pretend things were better than they were. If you were a member of a class and a population-It\u2019s fine.... that could take advantage of the opportunities that had been won and didn\u2019t have to look at what-Now we can relax.... had not been won.Now we can relax.Right? And that was the story of the 80s and the 90s, and then, of course, it sort of hit a symbolically ... You know, with the election of Barack Obama, which was read by many in a mainstream popular media as a signal that, like, \u201cSee? Racism was a stage through which this country has successfully passed. We have elected a black president.\u201d Well, and the stories around Hillary Clinton contributed to that, too. \u201cLook, the next president is going to a woman, inevitably. She might as well have been the president.\u201d And that, it was all part of this decades-long lie that was absorbed by the people who had the power to propagate it that we had fixed the glaring and defining inequities on which this country had been built.But there was anger that was bubbling up resistant-Underneath. Underneath.... to that narrative. So you had Occupy Wall Street, which was a furious demonstration in response to economic inequality. Black Lives Matter. That comes during the Obama administration when it\u2019s activists who are furious at the state killing of African Americans who are ... and in fact, thanks to the media and the ability to show streaming video of kids ...Kids getting killed.... getting killed that echoes some of the way that visual media was used to show the ravages of lynching Emmett Till\u2019s body. That is part of what enables Black Lives Matter to erupt in the way that it does, and this determination, an angry determination, to make those who don\u2019t want to look look at the violence that is being enacted by the state against African Americans all the time. And that movement becomes incredibly important to shaping our politics.It\u2019s interesting you say that about it. When you even say, \u201cLook,\u201d they don\u2019t look. I have relatives, and I\u2019m like, \u201cLook at the videos.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWell...\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cThere\u2019s videos now, and you still won\u2019t accept it.\u201dRight. Well, but that\u2019s true of every ... I mean, one of the myths about the civil rights movement is that it had wide public support and that, you know, no. It was, a minority of Americans were supportive of the Civil Rights movement. In retrospect, again, it\u2019s the way that we talk about Dr. Martin Luther King in a kind of sanitized way that doesn\u2019t even acknowledge the anger that drove him. There\u2019s a way we want to flatter ourselves always in retrospect by talking about all of the great strides we\u2019ve made without talking about how a majority of Americans resisted those strides in the moment that they were happening.Absolutely.So, but there\u2019s no question that Black Lives Matter changed the nature of the discourse around politics, pushed politicians, many of whom, if you look back at 2016, still both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were resistant to talking, being challenged by Black Lives Matter activists.So you\u2019re talking about the idea of rage being useful. So when you\u2019re talking about in the context of women, women get mad all the ... Yeah, like you said, I get mad and it doesn\u2019t ever seem to push the ball forward, to use a terrible ...Well, I think we don\u2019t-Manly.I think we don\u2019t often acknowledge the ways in which their anger may be politically consequential. So for example, the women who first started saying, \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Those are the women who founded that movement, which then becomes a mass protest movement that shapes, not just a protest culture, but a football culture, right? This is our industries, our businesses, our national pastimes. Right. Right. Fair point. That\u2019s absolutely true.Right, and I think that that\u2019s true of a lot of our history, because we\u2019re discouraged from considering women\u2019s anger as politically viable and politically consequential. What we don\u2019t see ... We can acknowledge Rosa Parks and Mamie Till as catalytic figures in the Civil Rights movement, but we never talk about their anger. Rosa Parks is brought to us as an extremely tired, saintly-Saintly..... and stoic figure, and we, until very recently Danielle McGuire\u2019s book Dark End of the Street helped change the national conversation about Rosa Parks, but that\u2019s a conversation that women within the Civil Rights movement, that Pauli Murray and Gloria Richardson were anxious to have during the Civil Rights movement, saying, \u201cWait, let\u2019s take a fuller look at Rosa Parks.\u201d Rosa Parks was a lifelong furious fighter against racial injustice. She was an investigator for the NAACP who investigated the gang rapes of black women by white men in the Jim Crow South, and investigated often false claims of sexual violence made by white women against black men.Right. She did. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.This was her life-That was her job, yeah.... was anger at racism and racial violence. One of the reasons that we are still able to write off women\u2019s anger so easily in a popular narrative as hysterical, marginal, unstable is because we haven\u2019t ever gone back and appreciated the ways in which angry women have shaped our rules.Right. Harriet Tubman.Harriet Tubman!She was pissed.She was pissed! You know who else was pissed? Here\u2019s a good example of the way we-You\u2019re right, Rosa Parks is always seen as this sort of saint. It\u2019s true.But think ...Gentle. What do you know about Abigail Adams?She was mad. I read the letters.Okay. Right. If you\u2019ve read the whole letters, you know she was mad.Yeah. Not mad, not insane. She was angry.Angry. By the way, it\u2019s not probably a coincidence that \u201cmad\u201d works in both directions-Right. Yes. That\u2019s true. ... especially when it comes to women.That\u2019s a fair point. Yeah, \u201chysterical.\u201dWhen it comes to women, right? There\u2019s a ... right. So-Oh, someone the other day called me ... I have to remember. It was one of those, hysterical. But go ahead.The way that I was taught about Abigail Adams, which is largely through PBS documentaries, right? Is that in the story of the founding-The love story.... Which, of course, is the story of our founding is we revere the disruptive-Fathers.... and chaotic rage of our founding fathers, who you know, N.B., were white men. Right?Yeah, and then the avuncular Ben Franklin.Then built a country. Right. But in the storytelling of that there\u2019s always this one line from Abigail Adams that gets sort of put on the museum walls or in the PBS documentaries, which is, \u201cRemember the ladies,\u201d she writes to her husband, John. Right? \u201cRemember the ladies as you make this \u2026\u201d Right, that was the big feminist statement, but if you actually go back and you read Abigail Adams\u2019 letter, that same letter, she uses the same language of revolution that the founders were using. She says, \u201cRemember, all men would be tyrants if they could.\u201d Right.Right? \u201cTyrants.\u201d It\u2019s the tyrannical rule of Britain that the founders are rebelling against, and then she says, basically, \u201cIf you don\u2019t include women in your vision for this new country, basically purported to be built on liberty and equality and representation, we are determined to foment a rebellion.\u201d She basically, in those letters-Threatens.She threatens a revolution, but that part, those angry parts where she\u2019s using the language of revolution around women\u2019s rights in the 1770s, we\u2019re never taught that part. We don\u2019t get the picture of Abigail Adams, who\u2019s furious to the point of threatening rebellion and using the language of tyrannical rule with regard to gender relations, right?Right.We\u2019re not told that in that same era-She\u2019s the help maid. She\u2019s the wise help maid.Right, and I was never told, I didn\u2019t know the story of MumBet, who was an enslaved woman in Massachusetts working in the home of one of the revolutionary politicians, and she hears the language of revolution and applies it to her own condition where she is badly physically abused within the home in which she is enslaved in Massachusetts, applies for her freedom, wins her freedom, and her case becomes the basis for the abolition of slavery in Massachusetts in 1783. So there\u2019s an example of a woman whose anger, borrowing from the revolutionary rhetoric in her home, leads to the change of a state law that abolishes slavery in that state. But are we ever taught the story of MumBet, who\u2019s later known as Elizabeth Freeman? No. We are never taught the history of women\u2019s anger as part of what changes the laws. Right. Right. So where are we now? You have all these various ... and there\u2019s anger washing across Twitter and social media. There\u2019s fake anger rushing across it. There\u2019s the #MeToo movement. There\u2019s all kinds of things around gender inequality and racial inequality going on. There\u2019s a president who creates anger everywhere he goes. And who has built his own power on-Anger.... the punitive anger of those who have historically felt that they had a grip on power that has been challenged by the less powerful, whose anger is-And there\u2019s so many writers now. I always say they kiss up and kick down to stop the anger from coming up.Right. You know what I mean?Well, because the anger from the powerful is-And his \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d thing is the same thing.So there\u2019s a pattern. What I was referring to before is, when the less powerful challenge the ascension or further accrual of power, this is a ... The Kavanaugh thing was a perfect example of this, right? In fact, the thing that was being threatened was that Brett Kavanaugh might not be appointed to the most powerful ... He wasn\u2019t even at risk of losing his job as a judge. He wasn\u2019t at risk of incarceration, losing his liberty. Nothing criminal. The question was would he get this massive promotion where he\u2019s going to have the power to determine the rights, ability to vote and control your bodies for millions of people for a generation or more. And the objection to his further accrual of power based on credible accusations that he had abused his power physically and sexually in his past, that was recast by the most powerful in the situation, the president, the party that was invested in his further accrual of power, as an attack on him.And I write in the book about the first time that I saw that pattern happen, and once you see it, you cannot unsee it. You realize it\u2019s happening all around you every day. Was, I noticed in 2015 when Freddie Gray was killed by police in Baltimore. He was taken on a rough ride and died of his injuries, and then there were protests in response to his death. And the way the media covered it ... I saw it everywhere. The violence \u201cstarted\u201d when protesters threw rocks, and that was the first time that that pattern leaped out at me, and I was like, \u201cOh, the violence done by the more powerful entity to the less powerful entity is essentially invisible,\u201d because that\u2019s just-No, the violence started with the riots.The violence is when there\u2019s the disruption to how power\u2019s supposed to work by challenging it. And then once you see that and you get that that\u2019s how it works, right? That the alleged physical assault, screaming, holding a screaming woman\u2019s mouth closed while trying to rip off her clothes while two men jump on her and laugh, that\u2019s not the attack in question. The \u201cattack\u201d in question is what has happened to Brett Kavanaugh and his family, right? And that is framed by the president, and not particularly challenged by a media that reports on him, that then goes with this sort of idea that there\u2019s an angry mob. The women who are yelling at the capital, the women who are so angry that they are protesting, women and men, their yelling is the only power available to them. This man has just been confirmed to the Supreme Court. The only power they have is to hold a sign and to yell through the vote. And so they are powerless in the situation, but they are cast as the aggressive mob, which is the same thing that happened during #MeToo. It was a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d right?Right.The people who were being aggressed upon were the men, who women were-Which they want to dismiss immediately, like, \u201cCan\u2019t we get this over with?\u201dYes.And the other day I was somewhere, and it was someone very powerful, and they said, \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201dNo.Not even close. You couldn\u2019t have better timing for this book, which is ...Worse timing.Worse timing. I know, I hate to say that\u2019s right. Good job! Congratulations.Yay.Yay! Everybody\u2019s pissed. Things are going downward quickly. So, #MeToo. Everyone\u2019s like, it\u2019s been about a year, right, I think, and it continues. The anger continues and everything else, and one of the things I\u2019ve noticed is everybody saying, \u201cLet\u2019s stop being angry now.\u201d And the other day someone was like, \u201cWhat would you advise people?\u201d I said, \u201cStay angry. Stay angry. Do not stop.\u201dAbsolutely.And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, don\u2019t you want to stop being angry?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201dNo.No. No, because it\u2019s not fixed, and it\u2019s the only tool available to get people doing something.Well, the anger propels people into doing all kinds of things. #MeToo is one of the expressions of the anger. Another is the historic number of women, and especially women of color, running for office. You have women whose anger at all of this has prompted them to support some of the women running for office. You have women whose anger has prompted them to join strikes, whether it\u2019s the fast food workers striking for higher wages or against, in the case of McDonald\u2019s workers, in response to pervasive sexual harassment. The teacher strikers of last spring. There are a million ways in which the moment at which you stop looking away from the things that will make you enraged and you start actually permitting yourself to feel the rage drives people to do something about that rage. And I think it\u2019s one of the mechanical, sort of tactical reasons that rage is discouraged in populations that have been offered so much less power historically.\u201cCalm down. Calm down. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dWell, and because, \u201clet\u2019s talk,\u201d but also if you quell the rage, if you discourage women from expressing it by telling them that if they do, they won\u2019t be taken seriously, they\u2019ll sound hysterical, they\u2019ll sound like children, they\u2019ll be threatening is particularly true with regard to how women of color are treated if they express anger. They\u2019re turned into militant threats in the public white imagination. And if you do that and discourage the actual expression of anger, then women wind up isolated and feeling like they\u2019re probably crazy or the only ones who feel that way, but if they express the anger and can make themselves heard with one another, they become audible and visible to one another, and then they can begin to form connections and organize. And that\u2019s when you get campaigns, activism, protest movements, strikes. Right? And that\u2019s been true throughout our history. That was true in the labor movement when a bunch of young women worked in the Lowell textile mills in New England in the 1830s and they founded one of the first labor unions and staged some of the first walkouts that were the beginning of what would become more than a century\u2019s worth of a labor movement that changed workplace safety conditions. So Lowell, another point. There\u2019s Triangle Shirtwaist Factory was another moment of that.Yes, the Atlanta washerwomen strike in 1881, which was primarily black women who were washerwomen in very tortured working conditions, making soap and things in a hot Atlanta, struck.So anger, anger, anger, anger. It doesn\u2019t seem like it matters to a lot of people. Like, here you have #MeToo and people get exhausted. They get just absolutely exhausted by ... You know that feeling, right?Yeah. Yeah. You mean from actually feeling the anger or participating in it?Yes, exactly. Yes, yes. And that, to me, is the stuff Trump does. He exhausts you with his ridiculous statements, and so you were like, \u201cWhich one was it?\u201d It\u2019s meant to do that. Right. It\u2019s meant to exhaust, although I would also say I\u2019ve been shocked by how long it\u2019s gone on. I mean, because I do. I see exactly what you\u2019re saying in this sense that being angry all the time can be exhausting, but one of the things I found writing this book and living through this period-Well, I want to know historical. What happens historically when ... What happens to-Often they, people, keep going. Right.And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re looking at. I mean, we have to remember that these movements, the civil rights movement between 1955 and 1964 and \u201865, which was when you have the Voting Rights [and] the Civil Rights Act, that\u2019s more than a decade. And of course, the activism had extended before 1955, too. Those were the two. Emmett Till\u2019s murder and the Montgomery Bus Boycott. You know, the Abolition and Suffrage Movement, in the 1830s, the Suffrage Movement begins to take root out of women who are involved in the Abolition Movement. Of course, you don\u2019t get abolition until the 1860s, so that\u2019s decades ahead. You don\u2019t get the 19th Amendment, which gave some women the right to vote, until 1920 when it\u2019s ratified, and you don\u2019t get The Civil Rights Act until 45 years after that. This is -Same with gay [rights].Right. The truth is, we feel exhausted after a couple of years. Perhaps those of us who did swallow that in some way, shape, or form, the lie that anger was out of place in the contemporary \u201cfixed\u201d world. But in fact, we look back at generations of people whose anger drove them through their lives. Propelled them, yeah. And in fact, many generations of people who died before they saw any fruits of their energies or labors. But, the fact that they gave their lives to those efforts, in fact, led to the forward motion that we then made the mistake of taking for granted. So how do you look at the current state of affairs around Me, ... I guess #MeToo would be the most prominent, but there\u2019s other gender and equality ... #MeToo is the sexual part, but there\u2019s the gender inequality in pay, there\u2019s -And the political representational inequalities. ... the political representational. And they\u2019re all branches of the same thing. I believe this is all motivated by a lot of the same thing, which is the anger of the underrepresented, the anger of the subjugated. And the tax. I was talking to someone who, we were talking about this and they were like, \u201cAnd then this happened.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cDo you know it\u2019s a tax on you? You\u2019re paying a tax that white men don\u2019t pay.\u201d Like you carry around a backpack full of rocks that you have to carry all the time. And you\u2019re taxed by systems that don\u2019t include you in how they work and how they operate, which is essentially, by the way, again, the complaint of the founders. Taxation without representation, right? Right.And so, the one thing that has to happen, and I think we have to come to grips with it, is that there is tremendous backlash. And by the way, the one thing I want to state is that the anger of women isn\u2019t always progressive. You also have women who are angry in defense of the power structure that\u2019s being challenged here. Oh, yeah. And that\u2019s white women, and that has long been the case throughout our history. And their anger is potent in this moment, too. And those are the voices -And I have to say, they drive me the craziest. Yes, yes. They drive me ... including the fact that my mother is one of them, but you know what I mean? We had such fascinating discussions around Kavanaugh and what saved it was my son, who would not put up with it which was -Really? Yeah. It was great. Did your mother change her mind at all? You know, it was interesting. I think I\u2019ve told this story. My mom was watching Kavanaugh and said, \u201cOh, he looks good. I think he\u2019s good. I don\u2019t believe her. And he\u2019s truthful.\u201d Or something, just something happened and ... She\u2019s not a Trump supporter by any stretch, but she is now, obviously. And [she] said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that could happen.\u201d And my son literally said, \u201cLast weekend I pulled two boys off of girls who were drunk.\u201d And that\u2019s his job. I\u2019ve given him that job. Yeah, I\u2019ve instructed him this is his job at parties and stuff like that. And she was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And he goes, \u201cIt happens all the time. Like, all the time. And they don\u2019t remember it, because they were drunk.\u201d Or something like that. And then her next move was, \u201cWell, the girl shouldn\u2019t have been drunk. The girls shouldn\u2019t have been drunk.\u201d And my son said, \u201cYou know when you\u2019re drunk, it doesn\u2019t mean you want to have sex, just so you know.\u201d And my mom was ... There was nowhere for her to go, and it was great. I was like literally, parenting finished, done. That kind of thing. But it took him to change her mind, not me saying, \u201cAre you crazy? You\u2019ve been sexually bothered.\u201d And, \u201cOh yes, I have, but... \u201c I think her thing was, \u201cYeah I have, but I dealt with it.\u201d \u201cDealing with it\u201d is one of the things that-\u201cI\u2019ve overcome it.\u201dRight. \u201cWhy are you complaining?\u201d Women who\u2019ve existed within the system made their peace with it and in fact benefited from being attached to those who\u2019ve had power within that system are motivated in a lot of ways-Or think they deserve it.Or think that they deserve it. And the whiteness comes into this because white women benefit from white supremacy, both themselves individually, and that cuts them off from the experiences of and alliances with women who do not benefit from white supremacy, women who are not white. This is a major dynamic going forward. And as the anger, the progressive coalition, driven in part by the anger of women, some of whom have been angry their whole lives and some of who are newly angry, is going to be met with what was already in place, which was the punitive anger of a power structure challenge. That\u2019s the Donald Trump campaign. That\u2019s birtherism. That\u2019s the call to open racism, misogyny, xenophobia. That is the wall, the, \u201cMexicans are rapists,\u201d the calls to hurt journalists that we\u2019re seeing borne out in the fact that bombs are being sent, that violence is being done. That\u2019s not new. This is what mass shooters have been operating from some of this violence for a long time. If you look at the overlap, it\u2019s anger at women who won\u2019t date them, anger at women who won\u2019t fold their clothes or ... That has already been, for a long time, the motivation of so much violence in this country, this fury at the disruptions in power that mean that certain kinds of people who historically have felt that they have a certain entitlement to power no longer feel like they have that same...I think the waking up of that group of people. Essentially you have to have had things done upon you to understand it, right? Now I\u2019m a white woman, but I\u2019m a gay woman. I remember that. I went through the period when it was very dangerous, and so I have some sense of not getting, you know what I mean? And then as you move down the stack, or up the stack as far as I\u2019m concerned, you have more and more of that so you understand it. But as you move up you don\u2019t even ... You\u2019ve never been acted upon.Well, it\u2019s how the sense that being acted upon could mean somebody questioning your appointment to the Supreme Court as somehow a form of violent aggression, especially compared to the context to the act of having been held down at a party and had your clothes ripped off, a hand put over your mouth and felt like you were going to be killed. And the idea that for some people in power, that former thing, that again the injustice of having a massive promotion in power, the further accrual of power halted or questioned could be viewed as a kind of mob act of aggression. It isn\u2019t end to the, \u201cMe Too,\u201d but that\u2019s the rear guard action, right, against it?Yeah. And it will be a forever clash, right? And in terms of ... I don\u2019t see any of this ending in our lifetimes. I don\u2019t think it should. This has been centuries behind us, and it\u2019s centuries ahead of us, and the aberration and the error was in not being mad all the time, being somehow convinced that we didn\u2019t have anything to be mad about. And of course once again, that\u2019s an affliction and a conviction that was held only by those who had the power and the insulation to trick themselves into thinking there wasn\u2019t anything to be mad about. And the thing that we have to come to grips with now, and I find this especially as there has been talk lead up to the midterms and the midterms ... Whatever happens in the midterms, whatever happens in 2020, this is not fixed with an election. This is an ongoing process.Right. We try and use those things in the same way.Right! They\u2019re crucial, they\u2019re absolutely crucial, and I don\u2019t want to take away from that. Just like the removal of extremely bad and violent men from positions of enormous power, that\u2019s a crucial step, is not having Harvey Weinstein in a position to rape women-Or Les Moonves.Or Les Moonves, not only to rape women but to shape our culture. But it is a trick to suggest, and this is part of the easy part. In so many ways it\u2019s so much easier to think of this as a story about individual bad people, and individual politicians, and if we could just get rid of Donald Trump or just get rid of Harvey Weinstein or Les Moonves, we\u2019ll solve the problem, when the real project ahead of us is remaking the entire system. And that is a project that will extend well beyond our lifetimes, but to which we must all commit.Are you hopeful when you say this?In the very long term, I\u2019m very hopeful. Well, if our planet doesn\u2019t burn. That\u2019s really the place where the hope hits a snag because we have a limited ... Something that has not been truer that we hadn\u2019t known was true in earlier periods during which people died in inversions, iterations, of this fight. We have a timer on us right now that I think ... That\u2019s where I can say that in the long term I\u2019m extremely hopeful, but I\u2019m talking the long term, you know, a century-long term. The short term, it\u2019s going to be really horrible, and people are going to lose and suffer and die and go to jail. This is our short term future, and I think we need to wrap our heads around it. And then this other factor, which is, can we rest enough control to try to stave off our natural destruction or unnatural, man-made destruction?Right. And do you ... Alright, we\u2019re bringing climate change into this-Well, it\u2019s there when I say do I have long-term hope? Yes, theoretically, if we survive.Let\u2019s finish up talking about what has to change, leaving aside climate change, I get that.Mm-hmm. Right, okay.Let\u2019s just leave that a sec for a moment. What has to change in the system right now, besides removing people from power that are the obvious abusers?It\u2019s fascinating because I was talking to someone, and they were talking about a well-known person who\u2019s gotten whacked and lost their power, and they were like, \u201cDid they really have to lose everything?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, they do. They really do.\u201d And they were like, \u201cCan\u2019t they come back?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, they can\u2019t.\u201d And they were like, \u201cWell ...\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, they can\u2019t. They do not get in.\u201d What was interesting about one of these people, they were getting into something that I had some influence over. I didn\u2019t, I was able to call the people who had influence. And they were trying to get into something, and I called them and said, \u201cIf you do this I\u2019m going to make sure they know that they know that you let this happen.\u201d And I threatened them. I literally threatened powerful people. And I said, \u201cI will make your life a living hell.\u201d And they were like, \u201cKara,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo. I\u2019m just warning you. If you don\u2019t do something about it, and if you allow this to happen ...\u201d It was really interesting. It was a really interesting thing that, I never had done that, which was interesting.That was Interesting. You were mad.I was mad. So, what do people do now with all this ... I don\u2019t think that anger is not focused, but if feels a little-It goes in lots of different directions depending on what brought you into it and what you\u2019ve learned since you\u2019ve gotten here. There are so many projects ahead of us. One of them is about, it\u2019s not just removing the individual bad guys, it\u2019s about rethinking who has power within institutions and what kinds of policies are in place that protect certain kinds of people and protect their power and add to it. So, it\u2019s about truly things that can seem unrelated, but like paid leave programs, subsidized daycare, the stuff that happens in an electoral or policy realm that determine, that contribute to-That\u2019s the tax.Who has what kinds of opportunities within the public sphere. Yeah you can\u2019t do as well because you have to go home to kids.To that end, it\u2019s a representational question within politics, and that means not just women, because we know that there women and people of color who legislate on a conservative side, too. But there also is a fundamental representational change that needs to happen. This country is governed by more than 75% white men.Oh, I thought that was just Silicon Valley.Yeah, I know. It\u2019s actually, remarkably consistent.I have this friend, this VC who\u2019s conservative, he drives me up a wall and back down it again. But he said, \u201cKara, what about people who talk about women\u2019s rights and then take money from Saudi Arabia? Why do I have to listen to them? What about people who say, \u2018Black Lives Matter,\u2019 and then they have no diversity?\u201d And I had to say, he had a point.No, it\u2019s a point. That\u2019s the point, is like we can have the individual instances of fury, but we have to engage policy. And these are things like raising wages, federal jobs guarantees, UBI, stuff that seems unthinkable right now because we\u2019re in this moment of incredible right-wing contraction. But this is the stuff that\u2019s on the table, or should be on the table, especially as the Democratic Party moves left, which I hope that it is doing. And it seems to be doing from the ground up with local and statewide candidates actually moving the body of the party, because a lot of this is about changing individuals, but it\u2019s about changing rules and laws and the system that gives people power. And so there a million different directions when you\u2019re talking about criminal justice reform, reinstating voting rights for felons, or all this kind of remaking. And the thing is, we have to think about these things in the very moment that the court, and it\u2019s not an accident that this is happening at the same moment, that the court is now with Brett Kavanaugh on it and this was always what was on the table when we elected Donald Trump and not Hillary Clinton, that the court will now have the power to depress the ability to make these kinds of changes, to further gut things like affirmative action, collective bargaining rights, reproductive rights, perhaps access to contraception itself, voting rights. They\u2019ve already gutted the voting rights act, and that\u2019s enabling this voter suppression all around the country. We\u2019re in a fight where the top powers are in a position to strangle the ability to resist, and insist on not just a reinstatement of the rights that were there, but an expansion of the kind of safety nets and policies...So that they don\u2019t come and get them next time.Right. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re on this cusp, where there is I think, has been building, a kind of understanding that we do have to remake the very fabric, the economic and political and representational structures on which this country is built. That is why we\u2019re in this moment where the top power [is] in its kind of death throes. But just because it\u2019s death throes shouldn\u2019t be comforting because they have the ability to enforce our inability to enact the changes that I think increasing numbers of people know we need to make.Let me ask you. I\u2019ve got to finish up, but are you hopeful?Yes. I have to be hopeful because if you\u2019re not hopeful then you\u2019re not going to fight, and there is nothing for us to do but fight.Right. And if you had to say what people could do right now, besides read your book, what do you imagine? Stay angry?Stay angry. Don\u2019t stop looking at the inequities of the world. Form networks. The most important thing, because everybody\u2019s driven in different ways, right? Maybe it\u2019s making changes within your own workplace, maybe it\u2019s running for office, maybe it\u2019s supporting candidates, maybe it\u2019s striking, maybe it\u2019s going to protest. And you have all these forms of anger driving you into civic engagement, getting an education about the history of social change in this country, which most of us, like we never had-We have no historical memory.Getting that education, I think, is absolutely key. Go to the library. Go read the people who are writing about the history of this, because you\u2019ll find so much that is resonant and that will help guide you forward. Labor movements, civil rights movements, all of it. So, everybody is going to be going in a different direction depending on their talents, their impulses, whatever. But I would say that a universal thing to do is find other people who share your anger, because it\u2019s the formation of networks and potential coalitions... And those coalitions are complicated. We repeat the inequities. We repeat the racial and class and gendered inequities. Every social movement in this country\u2019s history has been riddled with sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia. So, within those coalitions we also have to listen to the anger of the people we\u2019re trying to form alliances with, and take it in, and really hear it as instructive, including if some of it is at us. But form those coalitions and those networks because this is going to be a lifelong project, a lifelong struggle. And here\u2019s the solution to exhaustion, is you become part of a group and a network where when you need to take care of yourself, you can and know that you are connected to people who are doing the work and then you tell those people when they need to take a break and take care of themselves. That\u2019s the solution. The exhaustion comes when we\u2019re on our own and feeling alone and driven into this fury, and then there\u2019s no-one to rely on for support or help.Yeah, absolutely, which women do very well.So, form networks, listen to other people, be curious about what they\u2019re angry about, and then try and work with the people who you share common goals and frustrations with.Mm-hmm. I had this encounter on a plane the other day. I was reading the New York Times. I had a story in it and this women in the print publication, this women sitting next to us, flying to the midwest, she said, \u201cUgh, fake news.\u201d I was reading the New York Times. \u201cThose Hondurans, they\u2019re coming in a caravan.\u201d I turned to her and I said, \u201cWhen in your life did Honduran immigrants ever hurt you? I\u2019m just curious. Just when did an immigrant ever bother you?\u201d \u201cWell, never.\u201d And I said, \u201cSo why are you frightened of them?\u201d And we had this fascinating conversation. It was really interesting. What I was trying to do was not necessarily get to compromise, but common ground, not compromise because I didn\u2019t back off. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re terrified and scared of something you shouldn\u2019t be terrified and scared of, and it\u2019s sad that you\u2019re being manipulated.\u201d I was super in her face about that, and it was a really fascinating discussion because we got to commonality. And I was like, \u201cYou can\u2019t name one time you\u2019ve ever been under siege by an immigrant.\u201d And it was really interesting. It was really interesting, and I found it a fascinating thing.Did she react with anger?Initially, and then not. Yes, but that was okay. But I didn\u2019t back down. I thought about it. I was thinking should I continue the anger, and did.I would say conversations, communication is key, which is not the same thing as saying, \u201cGo rage everywhere,\u201d because there are real costs and censure and punishment inflicted on people who show rage in certain contexts, especially women and especially women of color. But listen for other people\u2019s rage, and talk to them.Yeah. I have lots of relatives, \u201cI\u2019m not a racist.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, you are.\u201d That\u2019s what I do. They\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m not a racist.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, you are. You\u2019re not getting off on this one.\u201d It\u2019s a really interesting time. But it\u2019s always been here, as you said. Anyway, I urge everyone to read Rebecca\u2019s fantastic book that she has written about rage. I don\u2019t want to use the word rage, right? I don\u2019t want to ... Anger.You can use the word rage. Anger.Yes. Anyway, her book is called, \u201cGood and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women\u2019s Anger.\u201d It is revolutionary. It will be. We\u2019ll see-We\u2019ll see.How it ends, how the story ends. Well, we\u2019re going to burn up apparently.We\u2019re not going to see how the story ends, because it won\u2019t extend long-We\u2019ll burn up.-After we\u2019re gone.How sad, Rebecca. Anyway, it was great talking to you. I\u2019m one of your biggest fans. Thanks for coming on the show.Thank you so much, Kara.
