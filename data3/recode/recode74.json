{"id": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 was a con, not a contest", "paragraph": "To dozens of cities across the United States, Amazon\u2019s widely publicized search for a \u201csecond headquarters\u201d looked like thousands of new jobs, up for grabs. To Pivot co-host Scott Galloway, it now looks like a \u201cruse.\u201d\u201cI lease office space all the time for my businesses and I always tell my real estate agent, \u2018We can lease any office in the world as long as I can walk there from where I live,\u2019\u201d Galloway said on the latest episode. \u201cAmazon is now talking about having three headquarters, Seattle, Crystal City and Long Island City. The Bezos\u2019s also own three homes, and the average distance from those three homes to a headquarters is 6.4 miles.\u201cThis was never a contest,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was a con meant to induce ridiculous terms that they then took to the cites all along that they knew they were going to be in.\u201dIn other words: By soliciting bids from lots of place where it was never going to move, Galloway alleges, Amazon was probably able to get more tax breaks from the pre-determined \u201cwinners.\u201d\u201cI would bet, Kara, that when they pick two cities and they went to 2 and 3, they didn\u2019t say, \u2018Well, only half our headquarters is going there, so we\u2019re going to let you cut the tax subsidies and incentives in half,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cThis just has ill will written all over it, and I think people started to figure out what was going on ... It\u2019s the Olympics on steroids. A lot of high fives and ribbon cutting, and then 10 years later, we realize it was a bad idea.\u201dYou can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott\u2019s latest episode.Kara Swisher: Hi everyone, this is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I\u2019m Kara Swisher.Scott Galloway: And I\u2019m Scott Galloway, future ambassador to Estonia after delivering southern Florida to President Beto O\u2019Rourke in 2020. Oh, Beto. I\u2019m so sad for you, Scott, that you didn\u2019t get your Beto as senator from Texas.Yeah, gets 49 percent in Texas, raises money on a national level. Hello, Mr. President. But more importantly, Kara, key question: A few days in, how are you feeling about the election?Well, it\u2019s a complicated topic and I have a lot of feelings. I have many feelings, I\u2019m full of feelings about the election. I\u2019m going to say how my son felt. So we get in the car and my son ... he wasn\u2019t with me. I was at an election party last night, and he woke up, he was reviewing all the things with me. He is 13 years old and he goes, \u201cI got to say, eh.\u201d And that\u2019s what he said. \u201cEh.\u201d He goes, \u201cDemocrats really can\u2019t deliver it, but the Republicans kinda suck too.\u201d And I was like, \u201cAnd: scene.\u201d That is exactly what the situation is. So, eh. Yeah. So you\u2019re not terribly upset, not terribly happy. Just sort of meh. Yeah. We just can\u2019t have nice things, as they say. We just can\u2019t have nice things in this country. So that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s fine. You know what? Gridlock is good. As far as I ... In this situation, I\u2019m good with gridlock, so it\u2019s fine. That\u2019s what we got. That\u2019s what we\u2019re getting. I\u2019m going to live with that. Gridlock is good. So, anyway!Bring it down to tech. Do you think this means anything in terms of the tech sector? No, no. I think they\u2019re not going to get regulated now because \u201cgridlock is good.\u201d You know what I mean? I think there won\u2019t be any moves, any serious moves, unless they can all agree that tech, that may agree on the bipartisanship that technology companies need to be regulated. Maybe that will happen. I think you\u2019re gonna see a lot of that from the states, like Gavin Newsom in California and some other states. You\u2019re going to see action that sort of makes the tech companies come to heel a little bit. On the national level, I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019m just going to have to find out. But Pelosi certainly is behind it, it\u2019s just a question whether she can get the Senate to do the same. So we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see if we\u2019re going to have a privacy bill or anything else. Probably not. Gridlock is the way, is the name of the game. Let\u2019s talk about big stories that are going on. Obviously, you had a good prediction last week about Amazon being in the Virginia, the Washington, D.C., area. And, in fact, there were some leaks that it was looking at Crystal City, Virginia, Dallas, and New York City. Actually Long Island City in New York. Tell me what you think about this. I refer to this not as a contest but a con. I think it may have blown up in Amazon\u2019s face. We\u2019ll see.Because?Time will tell, but imagine you\u2019re the wealthiest man in the world and you get to pick, or you have more options than anyone in the world, and you\u2019ve decided, \u201cOkay ...\u201d So, I\u2019ll personalize this. I lease office space all the time for my businesses and I always tell my real estate agent, \u201cWe can lease any office in the world as long as I can walk there from where I live.\u201d That is the exact same instruction that Jeff Bezos gave to this ridiculous con, this ruse. Because if you look at... Amazon is now talking about having three headquarters, Seattle, Crystal City and Long Island City. The Bezos\u2019 also own three homes, and the average distance from those three homes to a headquarters is 6.4 miles, so this was never a contest. It was a con meant to induce ridiculous terms that they then took to the cites all along that they knew they were going to be in. Also, the whole HQ2 and 3 is also a bit of a con and bad faith. It\u2019s like if you\u2019ve ever been to your kid\u2019s charity school auction and there\u2019s a frenzy for bidding on dinner with the headmaster and someone bids $9,000 and someone bids $10,000 and then they decide right then, well, we\u2019re going to do two dinners. Thank you for the $19,000. Because I would bet, Kara, that when they pick two cities and they went to 2 and 3, they didn\u2019t say, \u201cWell, only half our headquarters is going there, so we\u2019re going to let you cut the tax subsidies and incentives and half.\u201d This just has ill will written all over it, and I think people started to figure out what was going on. So what did they do? They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, the con is up. They figured out this wasn\u2019t a contest and we\u2019ve abused the Commonwealth and wasted resources and time of municipal officials. What do we do?\u201d Announce it into the busiest news cycle of the year. No accident that they announced it last night. Right? Well, here we are. Here we are. What\u2019s really interesting is having a second headquarters. I don\u2019t quite know what that means. I\u2019ve heard rumors of Apple having a second headquarters, etc. I\u2019m not sure what the point of a second headquarters is.Money. Give us money. It\u2019s a handout. Sticking your hand out. Yeah, but why? Second headquarters ...Just call it a headquarters and make it an office? It was an office, they\u2019re just going to call it\u2026 ?Yeah, but if you call it a headquarters you get everyone whipped up and every elected official wants to be the person to detonate a prosperity bomb in their Times Square, so they\u2019re willing to write big checks. So it\u2019s branding. So, it\u2019s a new stadium. Yeah, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s the Olympics on steroids. A lot of high fives and ribbon cutting, and then 10 years later, we realize it was a bad idea. Right. Well, we\u2019ll see. I mean, it\u2019ll be interesting. It does seem to have gotten flat. The balloon has gotten flat here on this Amazon headquarters. I\u2019ve always thought it was a ridiculous circus.You don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big deal. You just kinda, it\u2019s kinda come and gone. No, I said that. On CNBC they were to covering it like, oh, breathlessly. And I said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re enjoying this circus.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNot much. I don\u2019t think much of it at all.\u201d I don\u2019t think about it, really. I don\u2019t think it is that big a deal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that ... I don\u2019t know, analog places, that whole game is lost on me in every way, but I can see why the TV or whatever breathlessly covers it. It\u2019s just kind of silly and it doesn\u2019t help the ... What I really am interested in is how companies that are in the cities, like right now in San Francisco with Prop C, how the businesses helped the cities and how they take up their civic responsibility, because I think especially tech businesses really haven\u2019t picked up, in terms of what they need to, the responsibility of being a civic citizen of any city they\u2019re in. That\u2019s my focus, really. When are they going to actually behave the way banks did years ago and give money to the opera or give money to music or kids, whatever, programs and things like that. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. And you don\u2019t think, on average, they\u2019re good citizens? I think Marc Benioff has been, you know what I mean? But I don\u2019t, no. I think they operate in their little areas and they have lovely kombucha shakes up on the 10th floor and looking down and they don\u2019t participate in the city at large, and they drive up rents and I don\u2019t think ... I think there\u2019s a reason people, for example .... San Francisco, come to San Francisco and see where everything is headed, if you want to see the future. You can see haves and have-nots, filthy streets, not a lot of civic engagement by the tech community, which is the biggest employer in San Francisco. So you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see the future as far as I\u2019m concerned. We\u2019ll see if we can clean it up, but it\u2019s up to now the city officials to clean it up and figure out a way, and most of tech didn\u2019t like the idea of Prop C for lots of reasons. Some of them good, where does the money go? But in general, it\u2019s not a feeling that they ... even if they\u2019re of the city, they\u2019re not of the city. So I think companies have to start acting like they belong to a community. Thank you very much. Do you think they\u2019re going to do that on their own, or we just going to do ...I approve this ad for Kara Swisher for mayor. What? I\u2019m sorry.I\u2019m in. I\u2019m right behind Beto. Do you think it\u2019s fair or realistic to expect they\u2019re going to do it, or we need to elect people that have the backbone to hold these companies accountable?To make them do it. They should do it. They should do it, but you know, whatever their ... we have to make them. That\u2019s all. We just have to make them. Yes, exactly. And not roll over for them and give them these perks and things like that. It\u2019s just a ridiculous game. To your point ...It should be a privilege for these companies to be in San Francisco. Yeah, I agree.Not a tax break.Most beautiful city in the union. I spent 10 years there, but I don\u2019t go back a lot.Not anymore. Don\u2019t go back.When I go there, the impression I get in the way ... I would describe my experience there as, I went to go meet with an individual who runs one of these tech companies who\u2019s early 30s, a billionaire, and going into the office this thing I noticed was the number of severely mentally ill homeless people on the street below that building. I thought, \u201cWe really have become a dystopia.\u201d I mean, it is just a contrast. It\u2019s changed a lot in the past two years. It\u2019s rattling. I mean, really rattling. It is. It\u2019s rattling. And so we have to do something about that, and companies should be a part of the civic fabric of a society and they have to move in and they should do it on their own, but you know, we\u2019ll make them. We\u2019ll have to make them. That\u2019s all. Yeah.Let me finish this other big story. Go ahead.The divided Congress, what do you think that divided Congress means? So, I think there\u2019s this fissure on a bigger level, and I think of how it translates to business, and that is: We now have about 70 percent of the Senate is elected by about 30 percent of the populace. A lot of these red states don\u2019t have big populations, either they lost population or they just get two senators regardless of the fact that Wyoming has a population that\u2019s smaller than most congressional districts, but at the same time, over the last 10 years, if you look at who\u2019s accreted the majority of the income gains, they tend to be people into the cities with college educations, which is Latin for progressives. So you have the economic power or the people capturing the income gains are progressive and yet you have the political power going to the red states. So what I think you\u2019re going to see, Kara, over the next several years is kind of this \u201cwoke as a business strategy.\u201d Similar to what Nike did with Colin Kaepernick or Dick\u2019s getting rid of assault rifles. I think that a lot of companies are going to decide to try and be overtly political and appeal to progressives who don\u2019t feel represented politically, but quite frankly have all the money. So you\u2019re going to see increasing political viewpoints. Yeah, like Nike, Patagonia. Exactly. Starbucks. Companies are going to come out and say, \u201cHey, progressives, we\u2019re your company.\u201d It might be a principled thing to do.Because you have the money.It might be generally how they feel, but it\u2019s also a shareholder-driven thing to do. Yeah. That\u2019s interesting, because you have the money. That\u2019s interesting. What Land O\u2019Lakes did with that awful person. I can\u2019t even say his name. He won. I can\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re going to see a lot of that.I\u2019m not going to speak ... Whatever. Really? Oh, God. I\u2019m glad Land O\u2019Lakes did that. All right, Scott, what\u2019s up? What\u2019s next?  Let\u2019s try something out. The midterms are over, but can we come up with an assessment of how fake news ... How did social media do? Were we influenced? What happened here? What\u2019s your view? Well, it\u2019s interesting. I was just talking about this with ... I was talking to WNYC in New York about this. I think that they\u2019re trying. They\u2019re starting to clean it up, obviously. They keep announcing how many, like I took off 30 accounts, whatever. This is a cockroach problem, right? This is going to be an ongoing problem. It\u2019s not going to be suddenly just cleaned up, and so I think what we\u2019ve got to do is as these stories die down, like the Russia story, whatever, we\u2019ve got to really hold these companies\u2019 feet to the fire on persistently making it a cleaner and cleaner place. It reminds me, I was trying to think of an analogy, but it\u2019s like they\u2019re chemical companies that are dumping stuff into the river, they got to clean it up now, and they got to figure out a way. Now, look, there\u2019s been some damage. There\u2019s been some poisonings, but they\u2019ve got to clean it up now and figure out a way to do what they do and grow how they want to grow without continually doing this.So every time they make an announcement, they call me, I don\u2019t care. I was like, \u201cThis should be your job.\u201d It\u2019s like saying the New York Times should spell the word \u201cand\u201d right. I just, I feel like we\u2019ve got to make it their jobs and make sure they realize that that\u2019s what they need to do. So let\u2019s move to the how, and I want to propose an idea, and you tell me why it would or wouldn\u2019t work. I\u2019m fascinated with this concept of identity. I\u2019m in Los Angeles right now, and everyone is just so friendly in the Starbucks line, then in the moment there\u2019s a little bit of anonymity, and you\u2019re in your car, there\u2019s road rage everywhere. Then take that times 10 when you can invent a fake identity or 100 of them on Twitter or YouTube, and there\u2019s not only a lack of civility, there\u2019s people willing to engage in things that are unthinkable and damaging to the fabric of our society. Why wouldn\u2019t we demand or legislate that when people go online in \u2026 on formats that have shown themselves to be very powerful, influence elections, suppress voter turnout, that you have to have an identity and be who you say you are?Yeah. Yeah. I think that\u2019s critical. I think being anonymous makes sense in some cases. In some countries, that\u2019s the problem, and in being able to protect yourself in countries that are autocratic. So I think it\u2019s a big question, but in other countries, it\u2019s not the case. I always think that being anonymous ... And these bots, it just drives me crazy that they haven\u2019t been able to handle these bots, these bots gin up trouble and then humans get involved with them. To me, the bottom, the lowest bar is going to be get rid of bots and to make a lot of this advertising transparent. It starts with that, and then get rid of fake accounts, get rid of fake accounts and make sure everybody who has an account is a person, whether it\u2019s a good person or not, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be harder to decide. But, make sure they are actually a person. I think that\u2019s what ... I\u2019ve always thought anonymous was always a problem anywhere you go, because people act badly. I\u2019ve heard smart internet analysts say that if any sort of identity mandate was actually put in place that Twitter would basically go out of business. That you have something between a third and two-thirds of all Twitter traffic that they advertise to justify their entire ad business or their ad model would literally just go away. That two-thirds of it is bot-driven and noise. Yup, yup, yup. That\u2019s the problem. They don\u2019t want to show exactly how unpopular they actually are. You know what I mean? I think that\u2019s with a lot of things. Again, these companies would be better off creating a better service. I don\u2019t get why they want to have a shitty experience for people. That\u2019s the problem, because some of it\u2019s so wonderful. I mean, I\u2019ve had such a nice, interesting time on Twitter with this election, reading people, having opinions. It has a goodness to it that always gets superseded by the badness. To me, it\u2019s really ... it should be a business problem, that they should recognize that. Yeah. I\u2019m going to put on my tinfoil hat and come across as a conspiracy theorist, but I write a lot about politics and I\u2019ve been very critical in certain instances about the GRU in Russia. And whenever I\u2019m critical about Russian activity I immediately get comments saying, \u201cScott, love your stuff, but you got to get off the Russia bandwagon.\u201d I started noticing that same sentence structure, same theme across different areas where I post my content from different sources and different identities. Now, I genuinely believe that if I were an economy 1/15th the size of the U.S. and I wanted to wreak havoc or promote my agenda, I would identify a thousand people of influence, or in my case, a million people of influence and set these troll farms loose on them.I now believe that there are bots or bad actors going after almost anyone in responding and putting up content and they\u2019re not who they say they are. Does that sound ... am I paranoid? And which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I\u2019m wrong, but do you think this is happening? No, I think ... yes. I mean yes. Broadly, yes. These are well-orchestrated campaigns by different people. And the thing that you have to realize is they don\u2019t care what side they\u2019re on, right? That\u2019s the thing. They\u2019ll go after Samantha Bee, they\u2019ll go after Roseanne Barr, they\u2019ll go after ... What I think is gonna happen is when they start going after \u2014 and they are starting to do this \u2014 companies and affecting, like, Disney. That\u2019s happened already to Nvidia and it\u2019s happened. Like, when they start to really, especially with video manipulation and things like that, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. It\u2019s not going to be a tweet. It\u2019s going to be serious manipulation of video, of other kinds of things, and I think we\u2019re just at the beginning of that for sure. But you know, it\u2019s going to be a \u201cgreat\u201d future for us, Scott. That\u2019s where it\u2019s going. I\u2019m in a down mood today on the internets because I think they haven\u2019t...I was wondering how you were doing. I was trying to think of something to cheer you up and I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I\u2019m in LA-.You know what? Scott Walker lost. I\u2019m good with that. I feel good about that. It would have been nice to see Ted Cruz go down.Dana Rohrabacher lost.Yeah. Oh yeah. Did that Devin Nunes go or is he still there to drive us crazy?I don\u2019t think so. I think he\u2019s in a district, I think he represents his district pretty well, actually, but the honest answer is I don\u2019t know what happened. Well, good. He\u2019s not head of the committee anymore. Goodbye, Devin. He\u2019s the worst. He\u2019s the person who uses tech for bad. There\u2019s someone I would really like to ... Well, maybe I\u2019ll interview him and let\u2019s see how that goes. Anyway, last thing, we have predictions, but we\u2019re going to contextualize it, too. So we always end the show on a prediction. Give us a prediction. Let\u2019s just do a prediction. You have one. Correct? You have one to bring to us? Because you were good on the headquarters. You\u2019ve been good on a couple of predictions. Casper has still not been sold, but otherwise you\u2019ve been pretty good on it. Oh, that hurts. Casper absolutely will be sold. I think you\u2019re right.Okay. So this is more macro, but I think the consumer world is going to distill to a small number of what I call recurring revenue bundles, and similar to what Amazon has done with Prime, you\u2019re going to see some kind of mega brands, a Nike or a Walmart, decide, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m in charge of all of your, not only your shoes, but your fitness and maybe even your healthcare.\u201d You can get a knee replacement from a Nike-endorsed orthopedic surgeon. You could stay at a hotel that figures out a way to get you breakfast that\u2019s not terribly unhealthy for you, that has a gym that is Nike-approved and ...Where did you come up with this scheme? This is what I do. This is how I fake making a living.I just called it a \u201cscheme.\u201d That wasn\u2019t really nice, but it is a scheme. Where did you come up with this?Well, I think, as I said, I smoke a lot of pot, so that helps. And I have an MBA, so that\u2019s kind of the master cocktail for ridiculous business ideas that people will pay you a lot of money to hear. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to edit that out, what I just said, I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re gonna edit that out. So you would pick ...No, but I think recurring revenue bundles are going to be the next big thing.Recurring revenue bundles. If you look at a company that makes more than $10 billion or $20 billion or creates more than $10 billion or $20 billion in market value over a 12-month period, you\u2019re going to ... It\u2019s going to be an equivalent or a mimic of what Prime is to Amazon. Some of these things. Like you\u2019re an Apple person or you\u2019re a this person? I don\u2019t...100 percent, but it might go places you might not think. Apple might say, \u201cWe have a watch picking up on your health patterns. Kara, you would love Lululemon ...\u201dYeah, I\u2019m not doing that, Scott. And we\u2019re going to do a relationship with Lululemon and you\u2019re going to let us know where you are and going to deliver stuff to you and make your life easier around health and fitness. No. I\u2019m going to say no to this. I\u2019m going to give you a big fat no on this. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get into...You don\u2019t buy it?I don\u2019t buy it. I don\u2019t buy it in any way. I don\u2019t think Apple has any, I don\u2019t think they have any expertise to do this, and I don\u2019t think they have any interest in doing it, so I don\u2019t think they will. I think they\u2019re going to sell you a phone. That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do, and people are going to stick to their knitting, as I like to say. They\u2019ve all got to get into recurrent ... And by the way, the phone, I mean ...You may want them to, but they\u2019re not going to do that. Apple\u2019s not going to get me Lululemon. By the way, my son wears Lululemon. FYI. He likes their shorts.Every company \u2014 this is the key \u2014 every company has to engage in monogamous relationships. Right now they\u2019re dating, which is expensive and hard. They have to enter to monogamous relationships with consumers.Somehow you enter ... really? They can\u2019t be promiscuous? Crazy.That\u2019s 100 percent. Think about what\u2019s happened with airlines where it\u2019s all distilled down to a small number of networks. So I\u2019m flying Air France. It\u2019s an inferior airline, but I am in this monogamous relationship with Sky Team because I\u2019ve fallen in love with Delta because I fly Delta a lot, so now I do this stupid ... I\u2019m in this relationship with Sky Team that I can\u2019t get out of, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to be a series of four or five small networks, one for your media, one for your apparel, one for your travel, one for your health, and it\u2019s going to be a race to see what brand can be that, bring you that bundle.I think this is ridonkulous, Scott. It\u2019ll just be Amazon.Ridonkulous?! You\u2019re hanging out with your teenage boys too much. Ridonkulous!Amazon\u2019s just a store! Yes. No he\u2019s not, he\u2019s very smart. That\u2019s a good one. So my prediction, a bold prediction around recurring revenue bundles ...Is ridonkulous. I think Amazon is it. And your prediction is I\u2019m wrong. Because Google could have done it. That\u2019s ridiculous. Google could have done ... any of these companies did. I don\u2019t want a relationship with Google when I\u2019m getting my lunch, or Nike. I want shoes from Nike. I don\u2019t want my lunch from Nike. \u201cAh, my Nike lunch has arrived. It\u2019s delicious. It involves carrots.\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t want, say, you wouldn\u2019t want Emirates to plan all your travel. You wouldn\u2019t want ...No. I wouldn\u2019t want Emirates, because you know what? Since I\u2019ve been insulting the Saudis and everybody else so much for their dirty money, I think I would not want to fly on their airline because I think I\u2019d be flown somewhere ...Would you want Amazon to give you and your family your health insurance? No. No. I\u2019ll tell you, here\u2019s where I do like, here\u2019s where your ridonkulous idea does work. Say you\u2019re Airbnb. I do trust them on Experiences. They can do adjacent things, hotels and airlines. I could see that relationship becoming a little more serious. I would trust them because I trust them on their Airbnb home, so I could see that, if it\u2019s adjacent. If it\u2019s adjacent, Scott, I would do it. Otherwise, no thank you. Yeah. So Airbnb is absolutely one of them. Airbnb could move into all sorts of travel and just kinda take it off the table.If Airbnb suddenly wants to buy me shoes? No, thank you. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Yeah. But think about how many places that could go. Airbnb, it\u2019s either gonna be Airbnb or Expedia or another ... the Four Seasons is another kind of brand that could probably come up with a recurring revenue bundle. Yeah, the Four Seasons. Is that where you stay, Scott? Is that where you stay, is the Four Seasons?Well, this is an interesting point. Do you know what Four Seasons is? The Four Seasons ...Or are you stuck to going there?The Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, I used to always stay at those two brands. One, because they do a decent job, and two, whenever I travel someone else is paying, usually. But I\u2019ve stopped staying at these brands, and it represents kind of the end of the brand era because I no longer need to defer to the shorthand of the brand and I can go on my social graph or these weapons of diligence, TripAdvisor [and] Google. I can find out that the Waldorf, an aging brand that I would never associate with in LA, is actually the cool new hotel, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll stay.So you\u2019re seeing, at least in travel, kind of new and innovative is the bomb, and brand is declining importance, so kind of the sun has passed midday on brand. Interesting, interesting. You know what Four Seasons is? Holiday Inn for rich people, because they\u2019re all the same anywhere you go. Thank you. That was my thought on Four Seasons.Actually, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s huge variance in how the Four Seasons in Austin or Chicago, pretty weak. The Four Seasons in Toronto or in Budapest? Right, Scott, I\u2019m enjoying your hotel recommendations right now. Speaking of which ...I love hotels. I travel to hotels, not to cities.San Francisco, there\u2019s strikes going on because of robots delivering food, and one of the reasons \u2026 anyway.Although, speaking of robots, I just rented a car from Hertz and I\u2019m rethinking that in fact Uber may be worth $120 billion and we should replace every individual with the robots. Have you rented a car recently? Yes. I do it all the time. I think it\u2019s an awful experience. I had a terrible experience at Hertz.You\u2019re right. It\u2019s an awful experience. It is. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s a very good thing that needs to be developing, but we\u2019re gonna discuss that another week, because I have things to do. I\u2019ve got to go watch the Trump press conference right now.You do. What\u2019s on the slate for Kara? What is the most interesting thing you\u2019re doing this week? This week?Yeah.I\u2019m going to be interviewing Marc Benioff, but I can\u2019t tell you for who or why. It\u2019s a big interview. It\u2019s gonna be on TV.Wow, and you\u2019re a big fan of Marc\u2019s. So, Marc Benioff. Yes, I am. It\u2019s gonna be at the top of Salesforce tower. That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say. I\u2019m going to try to helicopter in and then jump from the helicopter, take a rope down the building and then crash through the window and then start the interview. What do you think?Better yet? I think he should build like a terrace and you should go have like a Mussolini speech. Yeah, something like that. Just address the entire city.Something along those lines. Anything for audience. Anyway, Scott, I\u2019ve got things to do. Good stuff, Kara. Have a good rest of the week. All right, thanks.
