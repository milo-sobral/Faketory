{"id": "Elon Musk on his year of costly tweets, journalist fights \u2014 and how it changed him", "paragraph": "Elon Musk makes no bones about it: He\u2019s had the worst year of his career \u2014 \u201cinsanely painful\u201d \u2014 and a lot of it is his own fault.\u201cThis year felt like five years of aging, frankly,\u201d he said in an interview with Kara Swisher on a new episode of the Recode Decode podcast. \u201cIn fact, my brother said: \u2018Look, if you do a self-inflicted wound, can you at least not twist the knife afterwards?\u2019 You stabbed yourself in the leg. You don\u2019t really need to twist it in your leg. Why do that?\u201dMusk, who is the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has been working 100- to 120-hour weeks and taking Ambien to help him fall asleep. But he pledged that he\u2019s turned a corner after a year of production and financial troubles at Tesla, multiplying probes into his conduct and companies, and ill-fated tweets (often sent late at night) that spurred lawsuits and questions about his judgment.\u201cI tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend a lot less time on Twitter than people probably think. It\u2019s like maybe 10-15 minutes or something.\u201d \u201cIt feels like dipping into the flow of consciousness of society. That\u2019s what it feels like. It\u2019s kinda weird,\u201d Musk added. \u201cSome people use their hair to express themselves; I use Twitter.\u201dYou can listen to the entire conversation right now in the audio player below.

At one point in the interview, he called some Wall Street Journal reporters \u201cterrible people,\u201d and said that some in the media are more akin to \u201cad salesmen.\u201d\u201cThe amount of untruthful stuff that is written is unbelievable,\u201d he said.Asked if that rhetoric was responsible given the aggressive rhetoric from the White House and amid escalating violence against reporters as recently as just last week, Musk would only say, \u201c[I] suggest the press take it to heart and do better.\u201dBy the end of the interview, Musk was reflective, saying he did regret some of the fights he picked with reporters.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he offered, \u201cto some journalists.\u201dSign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
