{"id": "Twitter is now consistently profitable", "paragraph": "It took Twitter more than a decade to become profitable, but now it seems like those profits are here to stay. Twitter reported its fourth straight profitable quarter on Thursday. The company\u2019s net income was $789 million for the quarter, but a lot of that was attributed to a massive \u201cone-time release of deferred tax asset valuation allowance,\u201d which accounted for $683 million. If you take that out, Twitter\u2019s net income was $106 million on $758 million in revenue, which was better than expected. In the past four quarters, Twitter\u2019s net profit is just over $1 billion. In the four quarters prior, Twitter lost $367 million. It\u2019s unclear how much other one-time items may have contributed to net profit in the past \u2014 Twitter doesn\u2019t usually mention anything. So here\u2019s another sign the business is improving: Twitter\u2019s adjusted earnings were $295 million for the quarter, which were up 39 percent year-over-year.It was Twitter\u2019s largest quarterly profit ever, and certainly a sign that the business \u2014 which has been somewhat disappointing in years past, thanks to the company\u2019s user growth issues \u2014 has stabilized. Twitter also reported a loss of nine million monthly active users, a decline it had prepared Wall Street for. The company has said this decline in MAUs is mostly due to its efforts to clean up the \u201chealth\u201d of the service, something CEO Jack Dorsey reiterated in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re achieving meaningful progress in our efforts to make Twitter a healthier and valuable everyday service,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a better job detecting and removing spammy and suspicious accounts at sign-up.\u201dTwitter also listed other reasons its user base declined. For example, Twitter said that GDPR, Europe\u2019s strict new data privacy law, also played a role in its user base decline. Twitter\u2019s daily user base, meanwhile, was up 9 percent over the same quarter a year ago. Twitter still doesn\u2019t break out how large that audience actually is, just how much it\u2019s growing. Still, the company is using that as a sign that its product is improving. \u201cThis quarter\u2019s strong results prove we can prioritize the long-term health of Twitter while growing the number of people who participate in public conversation,\u201d Dorsey added. Investors liked what they saw. Twitter stock was up more than 13 percent in pre-market trading.
