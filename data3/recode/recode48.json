Recode co-founder Kara Swisher shares some thoughts about Recode\u2019sroots and the road to this latest evolutionary step. [Kara Swisher / Recode]Thousands of Google employees staged walkouts around the world to protest gender inequality and a company culture that has tolerated and protected executives accused of sexual misconduct. The largest crowds were at Google\u2019s main campus in Mountain View, Calif.; hundreds also demonstrated outside of Google offices in Singapore, Japan, Israel, the U.K., Ireland and India. Here is the list of demands presented by the organizers of the walkout, including asking the company to remove mandatory arbitration clauses from employee contracts. And here are some scenes from around the world. [Shirin Ghaffary / Recode]More than 50 companies signed a letter opposing any effort by the Trump administration to roll back transgender rights. Signees include Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft, as well as non-tech firms including Nike, Dow Chemical, JP Morgan Chase, Levi Strauss and MGM Resorts. A leaked memo, reported last month by the New York Times, suggests the administration may be looking to rigidly define sex as binary and determined at birth; such a move could have a broad impact on the lives of transgender Americans. [Ina Fried / Axios]Apple ended its fiscal fourth quarter with a 29 percent revenue increase in its iPhone division \u2014 despite no change in iPhone unit sales. The company also met its overall revenue target of $62.9 billion \u2014 up from $52.5 billion this quarter last year. (Apple\u2019s Q4 quarter ended in September, meaning it only accounted for the first few weeks of the new iPhone XS and XS Max going on sale.) Apple also warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations; the disappointing forecast helped send shares down as much as 7 percent, taking roughly $70 billion off Apple\u2019s market value and forcing that value below $1 trillion. Cook also said that Apple will stop reporting unit sales for iPhone, iPad and Mac from next quarter \u2014 the start of its next financial year. [Natt Garun / The Verge]For the first time in its history, Spotify has turned a profit. The Stockholm-based music-streaming service announced Q3 earnings, reporting a net income of roughly $49 million \u2014 a share swap with Chinese tech giant Tencent gets some of the credit for that. Spotify claims 87 million paid subscribers, an increase of 40 percent compared to the same period last year; the service has 191 million global users, up 28 percent from last year. But even a profit coupled with strong subscriber and user growth wasn\u2019t enough for investors, who grumbled about missed revenue growth.
