{"id": "Voice tech like Alexa and Siri hasn\u2019t found its true calling yet: Inside the voice assistant \u2018revolution\u2019Where voice technology is succeedingConsumers aren\u2019t buying voice shoppingBig brands are going all-in on voice This is what winning could look likeWhat the future holds", "paragraph": "You can soon, if you insist, talk to your microwave \u2014 and it will listen.Amazon recently announced a $60 voice-activated microwave, along with 10 other new products using its Alexa voice assistant. Roll your eyes if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s the latest example of Amazon\u2019s obsession with making Alexa \u2014 which first launched four years ago \u2014 ubiquitous, from the kitchen to the car.And Amazon is hardly alone. Google has been ramping up its Assistant voice-powered gadget lineup, recently announcing the Google Home Hub, a smart speaker with a screen. Facebook just unveiled Portal, a device that specializes in video calls in addition to its smart speaker responsibilities. Apple has its HomePod, plus Siri \u2014 which has been around since 2011 \u2014 built in to all of its devices, from the iPhone to AirPods. Voice assistants are potentially privacy nightmares as they proceed to monitor more and more elements of our daily lives. That fear, however, hasn\u2019t seemed to put a dent in sales. As the holiday shopping season approaches, voice-powered smart speakers are again expected to be big sellers, adding to the approximately one-quarter to one-third of the U.S. population that already owns a smart speaker and uses a voice assistant at least once a month. Voice interfaces have been adopted faster than nearly any other technology in history. And with big sales has come big hype, thanks in part to breathless prognostications about our voice-driven future:While some of this will likely come to pass, the hype might be disguising where we really are with voice technology: Earlier than we think. About a third of smart speaker owners end up using them less after the first month, according to an NPR and Edison Research report earlier this year. Just a little more than half said they wouldn\u2019t want to go back to life without a smart speaker. While people are certainly enthusiastic about the new technology, it\u2019s not exactly life-changing yet. Today, voice assistants and smart speakers have proven to be popular ways to turn on the radio or dim the lights or get weather information. But to be revolutionary, they will need to find a greater calling \u2014 a new, breakout application.That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t already proving useful.Human-to-machine voice interactions are inevitable. And as affordable consumer devices and fast wireless networks proliferate \u2014 most voice-assistant processing happens on far-away servers \u2014 they are driving real utility and are changing how we interact with machines. Playing music and other audio content is far and away the most successful current use case for voice assistants. Anywhere from 70 percent to 90 percent of smart speaker users say they have streamed music on a smart speaker, depending on the study. About half of that amount do so daily. These statistics are meaningful, showing major change in how we consume media.Indeed, people who listen to Spotify on smart speakers are more likely to listen to music every day, according to the streaming music company, than Spotify users overall. They\u2019re also more likely to listen to music on weekends and request nostalgic songs.Old-school radio is feeling the smart speaker love as well. This time last year, 4 percent of National Public Radio\u2019s live listening hours came through smart speakers. It\u2019s now at 19 percent, according to Tamar Charney, managing director for personalization and curation at NPR. Importantly for public radio, which is funded by listeners, this listening is accretive, as NPR hasn\u2019t seen declines on other platforms. \u201cThe more time people listen, the more engaged they are with the content and the more likely they are to donate,\u201d Charney said. (Public radio stations now regularly remind listeners that they can ask their smart speakers to stream NPR.) \u201cSmart speakers single-handedly brought radio back to the home,\u201d according to Bret Kinsella, founder of the Voicebot blog and podcast, which are dedicated completely to voice technology. \u201cThe killer voice app is calling up music.\u201dEven podcasts, which can be more difficult to surface with voice assistants, are seeing a boost. People often spend twice as long listening to podcasts on smart speakers as they do on their phones, according Cara Meverden, founder of voice-controlled podcast curation app Scout FM.Even more compelling for the advertising-led world of podcasts, smart speaker listeners are less prone to skipping through advertising than those who listen on computers or phones.\u201cPeople are much less likely to skip ads on Alexa. It\u2019s more inconvenient to tell your Alexa to skip forward 30 seconds than it is to just let the ads play,\u201d Meverden told Recode. \u201cSmart speaker listeners are much more passive,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople with voice interfaces tend to accept what\u2019s given to them.\u201dVoice technology has also helped bring smart home devices \u2014 thermostats, lights, locks and any other appliances that can be controlled from anywhere \u2014 closer to the mainstream. Google\u2019s Assistant now works with more than 10,000 smart home devices from other manufacturers. Alexa works with more than 20,000.Instead of having to set up your remote-controlled lights or program a smart home hub, voice assistants have shouldered a lot of the complexity. In some cases, it\u2019s only a matter of plugging in the device and then commanding your voice assistant to control it.\u201cIt used to be that the only person who could use [the smart home device] was the person who set it up,\u201d Google Director of Product Management and Hardware Micah Collins told Recode. \u201cUsing the voice interface to control things represented a huge change in usability.\u201dThat has caused sales of smart home devices to increase. The worldwide smart home device market \u2014 including smart speakers, digital media adapters, lighting, thermostats, home monitoring and security devices \u2014 is expected to grow 27 percent this year to about 550 million units, according to IDC.The impact has been felt throughout the smart home industry.A majority of Leviton\u2019s smart light switches and outlets have been accessed using Alexa or Google Assistant. Has it helped sales? \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d said Leviton product manager James Shurte. \u201cVoice control is really the primary driver of more mass market smart home options.\u201dVoice assistants helped smart lock maker August double its revenue last year. \u201cOnce people buy smart speakers, they want to do things with them \u2014 connect them to lights and locks,\u201d according to August co-founder and CEO Jason Johnson. \u201cThey look for things to buy to make use of the speakers they\u2019re purchasing.\u201dIn a perfectly set-up house, you can control the sound, the temperature and locks with your voice. You can command streaming media to play with the movement of your lips. It\u2019s all very cool and Jetsons-y. But it\u2019s also stuff most could have done pretty easily without voice technology, by walking a few feet or by clicking on an app. While streaming radio and smart home controls seem like useful-enough functions of smart speakers, it would be disappointing if that\u2019s as far as voice assistants end up taking us. The life-changing thing you couldn\u2019t do without voice doesn\u2019t seem to exist yet. One thing that companies hope will happen \u2014 but hasn\u2019t yet \u2014 is that people will start using their voice assistants to effortlessly buy all kinds of stuff. Most surveys show that only around 20 percent of smart speaker users have ever used their device to make a purchase. The number that shop monthly is half that. A more alarming report for retailers by The Information said that just 2 percent of Alexa users had made a purchase with the device this year, through early August. Whatever the number is, it\u2019s not yet what retailers are dreaming of.Indeed, the majority of people still prefer to shop at physical stores, according to a May survey by Voicebot. Not even 1 percent of Americans said they would rather shop on a smart speaker.Perhaps in response, Amazon has been trying to convince consumer brands to feature Alexa shopping commands on their advertisements and packaging.It\u2019s certainly telling that the latest iteration of smart speakers all have screens. It points to the current limits of voice technology, especially when it comes to commerce. \u201cI think shopping is still very early days, especially for voice-only products,\u201d Google\u2019s Collins told Recode. \u201cShopping is predominantly a visual and tactile experience.\u201dWith voice, you only get one or two options when you\u2019re searching for a product, not pages and pages of a product catalog, like you might be accustomed to online. That makes it more ideal for household consumables \u2014 rather than, say, clothing \u2014 because they are low-cost, need to be reordered frequently and don\u2019t require as much consideration as discretionary purchases with higher price tags. Still, that\u2019s a potential king-maker moment for brands. Becoming the first toilet paper suggestion on a voice assistant can mean being the first toilet paper purchase.Some 85 percent of consumers who\u2019ve made a voice-assisted purchase say they\u2019ve bought the first option presented, according to a study from marketing agency Digitas.So big brands are trying to get first-mover advantage; they\u2019re not waiting for shopping to get off the ground before they start their voice strategies.\u201cWe believe that the impact of voice is going to be a bigger impact on the consumer journey than Google search was in the 2000s,\u201d Campbell\u2019s VP of Digital Marketing Matt Pritchard told Recode. \u201cTwo or four years from now, smarter people than me say voice will be the preferred way to search. If you haven\u2019t converted your code or site experience to be ready, you\u2019re going to be behind.\u201dHow it works now: If you ask Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Assistant to buy, say, shampoo, they\u2019ll surface what they think you\u2019ll want. Alexa uses several criteria to suggest a purchase option: Your order history, whether a product is eligible for free Prime shipping and whether the product has the \u201cAmazon\u2019s Choice\u201d seal of approval \u2014 \u201chighly rated, well-priced products available to ship immediately.\u201dGoogle picks products from Google Express merchants that are most relevant to the query. It also considers purchase history and information about user preferences, as well as an item\u2019s availability and proximity.Both companies say there is no favoring of specific retailers \u2014 or their own products.Brands also can\u2019t pay for visibility \u2014 yet. For now, Amazon and Google are trying to build trust among new \u2014 few \u2014 voice buyers by making their search results as relevant as possible. It doesn\u2019t, however, take much imagination to see a future in which Amazon or Google merchants could pay to have their products suggested by their smart assistants \u2014 like sponsored ads that crowd their websites \u2014 as a way to generate more ad dollars.Until then, brands are mostly using voice for marketing and awareness campaigns around their products. That often includes updating search keywords to reflect how people actually talk, offering more web content in general and beefing up brand FAQs so that they accurately answer queries customers might ask.The best examples of this are when a brand provides a vital utility related to its product. That utility usually comes in the form of a skill or action, which is basically a voice assistant\u2019s version of a mobile app.Tide, for example, created a popular voice skill that explains how to get different stains out of different fabrics.Campbell\u2019s offers step-by-step recipes based on items you have in your house. \u201cWe want to get closer to consumers so we can better know and better understand them,\u201d Campbell\u2019s Pritchard said.Patr\u00f3n Spirits Company suggests new cocktails to try and coaches you through preparing them at home.Since these brands would like to spread their messages as far as possible, they aren\u2019t sticking to just one voice assistant, but rather creating skills and experiences for all smart devices.\u201cAmazon is more of a bet on purchasing, while Google is more for browsing or education,\u201d  Patr\u00f3n VP of Digital Marketing Adrian Parker told Recode. \u201cBoth are in our strategy.\u201d Companies that complement or compete with the major voice players are keeping an open mind as well.Spotify, Sonos and Qualcomm, which all work in conjunction with smart speakers and voice assistants, are being neutral on which platforms they work with so they can reach the most customers.\u201cWe have a uniform, open platform that effectively scales across all voice control systems,\u201d according to Rahul Patel, senior VP and GM of connectivity and networking at Qualcomm, a company that provides software and processing power for other brands\u2019 smart devices. The company recently released an audio chip specifically designed to integrate headphones with digital assistants. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking sides; we\u2019re supporting everyone.\u201dSonos, which is known for its high-end speakers that work with Alexa and soon Google Assistant, is also remaining neutral.\u201cInstead of trapping people in walled gardens, Sonos\u2019 design is to be open and work with whatever voice assistant you want to use,\u201d according to Antoine Leblond, VP of software.  It\u2019s too soon in the voice revolution to call a winner, but companies are certainly staking their claims.Siri had a few years\u2019 head start among voice assistants and is now actively used on half a billion devices, including on iPhones, MacBook Pros and Apple Watches. However, Apple\u2019s voice assistant has been riddled with problems that caused it to largely squander that lead.Google Assistant, thanks to Android\u2019s omnipresence, also claims that it\u2019s on half a billion devices.Amazon is the smart speaker leader for now, though it\u2019s hamstrung by not having its own phone. The company is making up for that deficit by doubling down on loading other devices with Alexa in the hope of cornering the smart home and auto markets. Importantly, it recently unveiled a low-cost Alexa-enabled chip that can make stupid devices smart.In the second quarter of this year, Amazon had 41 percent of global smart speaker shipments, followed by Google at 28 percent, according to Strategy Analytics data. In the U.S., Amazon makes up about 65 percent of installed speakers as of September, according to a Voicebot survey.Market share, however, isn\u2019t everything. The future will likely include a number of smart assistants, depending on where you are and what you want to do. Juniper estimates that the average smartphone user will engage with three voice assistant platforms by 2022. \u201cNo single smart assistant platform can provide the complete portfolio of services and devices that consumers are looking for,\u201d according to Adam Wright, a senior research analyst at IDC.For Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, what\u2019s most important is getting users to participate in their ecosystems. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to forgo revenue from hardware for new customers using their services,\u201d Wright said.In Amazon\u2019s case, that means getting people to buy more through Prime and to subscribe to Amazon Music. For Google, it\u2019s encouraging interaction with its search and other products like Gmail, YouTube and Maps \u2014 all of which produce ad dollars for it. Microsoft\u2019s Cortana \u2014 which also works with Alexa \u2014 wants people to use its Office suite. Indeed, Microsoft is leaning its efforts heavily into enterprise, recently releasing a platform that lets companies build their own workplace skills with Cortana. Apple, in addition to looking for Apple Music subscribers, is making a hardware play. Unlike the others, Apple makes it more difficult for third parties to create hardware for Apple devices. Until recently, outside device makers had to include a physical Apple chip in their products that significantly drove up the material costs. Still, Apple charges royalties and has to approve partner devices. While it slows growth, this sort of environment allows Apple to guarantee a higher quality in its few devices and perhaps more of their own hardware sales in the future.Voice assistants have gotten good at answering one-off questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s the capital of North Dakota?\u201d or, \u201cWhat time is the Cavaliers game tonight?\u201d But their ability to follow a line of thought or figure out what a pronoun is referring to is limited. A voice assistant is capable of three or four back-and-forth interactions at most, barring it from having a true conversation, though it\u2019s incrementally getting better.For consumers, what matters most is that voice technology works, regardless of what name the assistant goes by. But, assuming that the devices someday attain a level of accuracy similar to one another, which device and assistant consumers use will likely come down to other preferences. People who prefer shopping on Amazon might pick Alexa, while Walmart and Target shoppers might like Google Assistant better. Those who want a wide variety of smart home device options will have those with Google and Amazon. Those who prefer the Apple universe and its high-end products will end up with Siri.Fortunately for voice enthusiasts, we\u2019re still in early days. Smart speakers, like training wheels, are getting people more used to talking to their devices. However, the future of voice probably won\u2019t be on speakers at all. The major speaker makers have all added screens to their assistants. Samsung, smartly, is putting its voice assistant Bixby on its TVs, which have the potential to become the smart assistant hub of choice.The key element is the voice assistant, regardless of what device it resides in. Smart assistants will creep into every aspect of our lives and will be available at home and away. Some see a future in which stores and other public places are outfitted with voice assistants that will be able to recognize you and adapt their responses to your individual needs. For now voice assistants are still working on figuring out what you\u2019re saying in the first place. What we ultimately do with this surfeit of voice technology remains to be seen. Think of the mouse in the \u201980s. The new way of interacting with computers was met with scorn, but that was less about the concept than the possibilities and execution. At first the mouse\u2019s precision was poor and software hadn\u2019t yet figured out how to smartly utilize the new technology. Fast-forward nearly 40 years and it\u2019s tough to imagine design software and video games without a mouse or touch pad. Voice is much more intuitive than a mouse, but we\u2019re still trying to find ways to make voice work.\u201cThere\u2019s always been a tendency to force the \u2018old\u2019 onto the \u2018new\u2019 when it comes to emerging technology platforms \u2014 the first ads on television, for example, were essentially radio ads, read out loud,\u201d Will Hall, chief creative officer of Rain, a digital agency that specializes in voice, told Recode, regarding early attempts at voice advertising. \u201cEventually TV ads evolved into multi-sensory stories \u2014 images of a car driving down the highway, music blaring \u2014 and so will the voice experience.\u201d Until we find the app, use-case or invention that could only be possible using voice, we\u2019re still just repurposing online content for your ears.
