{"id": "What happens to free speech when we all live in a virtual world?", "paragraph": "Palmer Luckey thinks a lot about the future of technology, but he doesn\u2019t worry much about it. The Oculus founder, who is now building tech for the military, doesn\u2019t lose sleep over the kinds of concerns that weigh on a lot of technologists, like artificial intelligence or facial recognition software. \u201cI\u2019m a big optimist on technology,\u201d Luckey said Thursday from the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon. \u201cIn science fiction, so often technology is portrayed as this doomsday technology, like one thing or another is going to crush us all. I think that the reality is actually pretty boring. \u201cSociety is going to continue to get better, technology is going to continue to get better. [We\u2019ll] have little stumbles along the way, but fundamentally the nature of humanity is not going to change too much,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get through all this stuff.\u201dThat\u2019s not a huge surprise coming from Luckey, whose entire career has been on the forefront of building new technologies. He sold his virtual reality company, Oculus, to Facebook for $3 billion well before VR was a mainstream technology. (It still isn\u2019t.) But what if Luckey had to pick something on the tech horizon to worry about? Free speech, Luckey said. That\u2019s not surprising considering there are some who believe Luckey may have been fired from Facebook for being a conservative. (Not true, says Mark Zuckerberg.) But Luckey\u2019s concern is probably not what you think. He believes that, eventually, we will all spend \u201chuge portions of our lives in virtual environments,\u201d presumably like the movie \u201cReady Player One\u201d or like the virtual avatars Facebook pushes as a way to stay connected with family and friends.  \u201cI worry about a time in the future where people are spending a huge amount of time in virtual spaces and do not have the ability to talk about certain ideas, with the ability to really have any concept of free speech,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cI worry about a world where we have a hypothetical right to free speech ... out in the real world, and that that right doesn\u2019t matter because very few people even spend most of their time there.\u201dIt\u2019s an interesting concept. If it\u2019s true that we\u2019re all going to spend time \u201cliving\u201d in virtual reality, who will be tasked with making the rules of that society? The government? The tech company that created it? Will there be any rules? It\u2019s certainly not a problem right now \u2014 at least not in virtual worlds. VR headsets are far from mainstream. Augmented reality headsets, which blend the real world and virtual worlds, are in their infancy. Free speech in the real world is still a major problem for tech companies trying to police their platforms for racist or dangerous speech. Just ask Luckey\u2019s old employer, Facebook. But Luckey is clearly planning for a world most of us cannot yet imagine. \u201cI also think that worry is happening on a timeline that\u2019s so long,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we\u2019re going to solve those problems well before it\u2019s any kind of doomsday.\u201d Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
