{"id": "The \u2018Stories\u2019 product that Facebook copied from Snapchat is now Facebook\u2019s future", "paragraph": "Stories is the most interesting and important product at Facebook.That much was evident during Facebook\u2019s third-quarter earnings call today, an interesting and uncharacteristically transparent call with investors during which CEO Mark Zuckerberg name-dropped multiple competitors and admitted that Facebook has had trouble building a business around some of its core features, like video and private messaging. Stories, the ephemeral photo and video posts that Facebook copied from Snapchat, was mentioned continuously throughout the hour-long call \u2014 a total of 71 times, according to the call transcript.Stories has been a huge hit inside of Facebook\u2019s apps, especially Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg even said that people will share more to Stories than they will to Facebook or Instagram\u2019s feeds in the \u201cnot-too-distant future,\u201d making Stories one of the most dominant ways that people share photos and videos online. \u201cI just think that this is the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cPeople want to share in ways that don\u2019t stick around permanently, and I want to be sure that we fully embrace this.\u201d \n    Related\n  There is a problem with Facebook\u2019s obsession with Stories, though: The business isn\u2019t there yet, which means that as users turn their time and attention to Stories, and away from the feed, Facebook is scrambling to build a business that can capitalize on that shift in attention. \u201cThis happened very quickly. This whole trend has been \u2014 is much newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall,\u201d Zuckerberg said of the user adoption. On the monetization front, Zuckerberg was blunt. \u201cWe\u2019re earlier in developing our ads products for Stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make as much money from them as we do from feed ads.\u201dFacebook has talked about this before, but the interest in Stories has never been so high. Part of the reason is that Facebook has said for years now that it\u2019s  looking for places outside of the core feed to sell advertising, something that is particularly important given that Facebook isn\u2019t growing as quickly as it has in the past. Despite selling ads inside Messenger, inside its Craigslist competitor Marketplace, and inside its new video section, Watch, Stories seems to be Facebook\u2019s best option to make more money off the set of users it already has. In the meantime, expect Facebook\u2019s revenue growth to slow down while the company gets advertisers to buy into Stories and its vertical video ad formats. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get ads in Stories to perform as well as feed over time, and that the opportunity will be even bigger, because it looks like Stories will be a bigger medium than feed has been,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you just yet what that time frame is going to look like,\u201d he added. Zuckerberg rarely mentions Facebook\u2019s competitors. When he does, it\u2019s usually because Facebook is outperforming them, and he almost never calls them out by name. That wasn\u2019t the case on today\u2019s earnings call. In the first few minutes of Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared remarks, he mentioned YouTube, Apple (specifically iMessage), Pinterest, Twitter and LinkedIn. \u201cWhile [Facebook\u2019s video section] Watch is growing very quickly, we\u2019re well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience,\u201d Zuckerberg said, offering a rare admission that Facebook is not just competing with someone, but actually losing to that competitor. Zuckerberg then talked a bit about Facebook\u2019s strength as a messaging service \u2014 it owns WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, each with more than 1.4 billion users \u2014 before he name-dropped Apple. \u201cWe\u2019re leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is iMessage,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIn important countries like in the U.S. where the iPhone is strong, Apple bundles iMessage as the default texting app and is still ahead.\u201dWhat ... is going on? It\u2019s certainly possible that Zuckerberg is seeding the idea that Facebook isn\u2019t as dominant as everyone thinks in order to ward off potential antitrust concerns. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Zuckerberg was asked by Congress who Facebook\u2019s competitors are, and he didn\u2019t have a good answer. A lot of people left that hearing with the idea that, perhaps, Facebook has an internet monopoly. As my former colleague Tony Romm pointed out on Twitter, Zuckerberg may be bracing for a change in congressional control. Whatever the reason, it was rare.  You should expect to see even more Facebook video in your feed moving forward. That\u2019s because Zuckerberg claims that Facebook has had to \u201crate-limit its growth\u201d on the network because it was cutting into other behaviors Facebook wanted to encourage, like \u201csocial interactions.\u201d\u201cWe needed to figure out a way that video can grow but people can also keep on interacting and doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd now I think we\u2019re starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate that it wants to.\u201dOn one hand, it\u2019s bizarre that Zuckerberg and Facebook would cut back on video distribution, considering how hard it has pushed video \u2014 both live and produced video \u2014 on its publishing partners over the years. (Though the company has said in the past it wants to cut back on passive video consumption.)But the bad news with more video is that, like Stories, Facebook hasn\u2019t built the kind of robust business around video ads that it has around its regular feed ads. \u201cVideo monetizes significantly less well per minute than people interacting in feed,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAs video grows, it will still displace some other services where we we\u2019d probably make more money.\u201dIt was the second admission from Zuckerberg, along with Stories, that users are starting to spend time using products and features that Facebook doesn\u2019t monetize well. You can expect these to come back up if and when Facebook\u2019s revenue growth starts to become a problem down the line. Facebook\u2019s user base in its most valuable markets \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Europe \u2014 is no longer growing. That isn\u2019t a shock, as we\u2019ve seen this trend coming for the last few quarters, but today\u2019s earnings call made it official. Facebook\u2019s U.S. audience hasn\u2019t grown in the past two quarters, and the company reported its second straight audience decline in Europe. Facebook is massive in the U.S. and Europe, and eventually, the company was bound to run out of potential new users in those markets. But it still matters, because those markets are the most valuable to Facebook\u2019s business. Each user in the U.S. generated $27.61 in revenue for Facebook last quarter. Each user in the \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d region generated just $2.67 in revenue. The top three growth markets for new Facebook users last quarter: India, Indonesia and the Philippines.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.The city has seen some of the worst air quality in the world in the past few days.The company is under fire, again, this time for years of dirty tricks exposed by the New York Times.Plus: How Facebook, Google and Amazon got away with not being regulated; the FCC gives Elon Musk the green light to launch more than 7,000 internet satellites; the word of the year is ...Also: Zuckerberg gave Sandberg his personal vote of confidence following a damning New York Times story published Wednesday.A Verge affiliate site"}
