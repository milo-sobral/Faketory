{"id": "Facebook\u2019s top execs \u2018make tobacco executives look like Mr. Rogers\u2019", "paragraph": "Facebook has endured scandal after scandal in the past two years. This one feels different.The New York Times published a jaw-dropping report Wednesday that laid out how the company sought to cover up knowledge of Russian meddling and discredit its critics; the paper said COO Sheryl Sandberg oversaw a campaign of dirty tricks while CEO Mark Zuckerberg ignored problems or deflected responsibility. And in short order, once-implausible questions about whether Zuckerberg would fire Sandberg or policy VP Joel Kaplan have become plausible.But Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher says no matter what, the buck has to stop with Zuckerberg himself.\u201cSheryl Sandberg ... really comes off the worst in this story, although I still cannot stand the ability of people to pretend that this is not all Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she said on the latest episode of Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway. \u201cHe is the CEO. He has 60 percent. He\u2019s an adult, and they\u2019re treating him like this sort of adult boy king who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s ridiculous. He knows exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201dGalloway said he did not take any pleasure in criticizing Sandberg because she had \u201cwritten eloquently on personal loss and the important discussion around gender equality.\u201d But he mused that those accomplishments gave her \u201cunfair\u201d protection, and that it might also be true that she will be \u201cunfairly punished.\u201d (Zuckerberg, for his part, said Sandberg \u201cwill continue to be\u201d at the company and credited her with leading the efforts to clean up Facebook thus far.)\u201cWinston Churchill said at the outset of World War II, \u2018Never have so many owed so much to so few,\u2019\u201d Galloway said on the new podcast. \u201cAnd it got me thinking. Can you think of any individuals who have made so much money doing so much damage? I mean, they make tobacco executives look like Mr. Rogers.\u201dYou can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts \u2014 including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott\u2019s latest episode.Hi, everyone. This is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I\u2019m Kara Swisher.And I\u2019m Scott Galloway here with breaking news. HQ-14A is Kara\u2019s, you guessed it, Fiesta. Congratulations, Kara.No problem.Well done.You know, we were going to talk about this Amazon HQ2 mess, which was also sort of bad press for them this cycle because of where they selected, and some objections to them picking places where you had predicted they would pick. So they announced a second headquarters in New York City, and also a sub in Washington, D.C., along with a smaller facility in Nashville, which is basically one of their distribution facilities.We were going to talk about this, but really there\u2019s nothing to talk about today but Facebook, right? Correct? I mean, this New York Times story which really brought together a lot of stuff. A lot of amazing reporting has been going on over Cambridge Analytica from the Guardian and from lots and lots of sources. I\u2019ve been whacking at them in the New York Times in my opinion column and stuff like that, but this really brought together a lot of stuff, and included some facts and details that were so disturbing in terms of deflection and trying to push blame elsewhere that even I, who have been really critical of Facebook, was astonished by it.So I\u2019d just love to get your take, or whatever you want to talk about.Well, first, what are you hearing? Before we jump on here, you just started reading a letter. You know these people. I don\u2019t. What are you hearing?I think the repercussions, especially for Sheryl Sandberg, who really comes off the worst in this story, although I still cannot stand the ability of people to pretend that this is not all Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s responsibility. He is the CEO. He has 60 percent. He\u2019s an adult, and they\u2019re treating him like this sort of adult boy king who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s ridiculous. He knows exactly what\u2019s going on. And so to begin, I will say let\u2019s put the responsibility where it belongs, on the person who controls the company completely, and that\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.But he\u2019s got all these executives, including Sheryl Sandberg, who is the COO; Elliot Schrage, who has left, but he was the head of policy and communications; Joel Kaplan, their man in Washington; and this group of people and many others at the top really did, as I have been saying, abrogate their responsibility for what happened. And not only that, they had a bunch of dirty tricks to do so. You know what I mean? According to the New York Times.So there\u2019s going to be all these repercussions on all of them in terms of their personal relationships, in terms of their outside of Facebook profiles, which Sheryl Sandberg has a big one from \u201cLean In\u201d and stuff like that. But this is a letter from Patrick ... I just got it sent to me by someone. Patrick Gaspard, the president of the Open Society Foundation, just saying, \u201cThe notion that your company at your direction actively engaged in the same behavior to try to discredit people exercising their First Amendment rights to protest Facebook\u2019s role in disseminating vile propaganda is frankly astonishing to me. It\u2019s disappointing to see how you have failed to monitor hate and misinformation on Facebook\u2019s platform to now learning that you are active in promoting this distortion is beyond the pale.\u201d I mean, you\u2019re going to see tons of this, I think.There\u2019s going to be a lot of it.No question.But my question for you is, don\u2019t you believe ... And people say I\u2019m piling on, but I\u2019ve been at the bottom of the scrum for a while, and I\u2019ve always been very reticent to be critical of Ms. Sandberg, because I believe she is a protected class of a protected class.Meaning what? Meaning ... Well, she\u2019s an inspiring woman. She\u2019s written eloquently on personal loss and the important discussion around gender equality. And what has happened is I believe she\u2019s the ultimate sheep\u2019s clothing around a wolf.That\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s an interesting way to put it.She has been the most effective heat shield in history.Yes.Think about this. Let\u2019s talk about Fox. What if Rupert Murdoch ... What if it came out, and you and I have similar feelings about Fox, but what if it came out that the Wall Street Journal was taking ads that were sowing havoc, and that their online properties had been weaponized by the GRU, and it ended up that Rupert Murdoch hadn\u2019t put in place any safeguards whatsoever to stop the contamination of our elections.Yeah. Right. I said it this morning on ...Would he even travel to the U.S.? I don\u2019t think he would, because I think he\u2019d be worried he\u2019d be arrested when he deplaned. Right. No, I agree. I mean, what\u2019s interesting ... Someone just wrote me this, actually. I\u2019ll read it directly. \u201cSome will settle down, but I think she looks really bad coming out of this. As you say, in a way, she\u2019s the most vulnerable since she\u2019s a professional hired woman, and Zuckerberg is the founder, a dude no one thought he had people skills, altruistic motives.\u201d Anyway, everyone expects so little from men. You know what I mean? She will bear the brunt of this, but you\u2019re right.That\u2019s interesting. Yeah.But they\u2019re all responsible. Look, they\u2019re all highly paid. They\u2019re billionaires.Great point.They\u2019re beyond billionaires.You know what quote comes to mind for me? I love war history, and Winston Churchill said at the outset of World War II, \u201cNever have so many owed so much to so few,\u201d and it got me thinking. Can you think of any individuals who have made so much money doing so much damage?No. No.I mean, they make tobacco executives look like Mr. Rogers.Well, you know, it\u2019s interesting you say that, because just this week I interviewed Marc Benioff for a show that\u2019s going to be on Sunday on MSNBC. It\u2019s one of my specials there called \u201cRevolution.\u201d Thank you for that ad. And it\u2019s actually a really good interview, but in it \u2014 and there\u2019s clips out there \u2014 he talks about them being ... He said, \u201cFacebook is a cigarette company.\u201d And then I said, \u201cWell, people die from cigarettes.\u201d And he kept going, he goes, \u201cYes, and they\u2019re a cigarette company.\u201dThey\u2019re dying on Facebook. People are being pulled out of cars.Yeah, and so it was really interesting. Recently, before Marc\u2019s interview, I did one with Tim Cook, and same thing, he had some real criticisms of Facebook. And at one point, I asked him, \u201cWhat would you do if you were in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s situation?\u201d He said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201dYeah, that was a great line.It prompted so much anger from Facebook. I remember at the time they focused not on what Tim was saying, which was a very cogent discussion of what they should do. Instead, focusing on that one comment, and as it turns out, Mark was so petty that after he heard that comment in this New York Times article, he switched the phones to Android. I mean ... Which is serious punishment. Have you tried using an Android phone?No. No, I don\u2019t. I use Apple.Oh, my God. Using an Android phone is like paying for dinner with a Discover card. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cDon\u2019t have sex with me.\u201d It\u2019s the ultimate prophylactic that says \u201cI should be ...\u201dOh, Scott. Once again.\u201dI should be screened out of the gene pool.\u201d If you use an Android phone or have a Discover card, your family tree should come to an end.Instead of listening to very cogent feedback from someone who is pretty good at his job, they would focus on that, and they were so focused on the comment. And I kept saying, \u201cCan you listen to what he said? Are you not adults? So what, they took a little shot at you.\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019re doing it for PR.\u201d As it turns out, they tried to slime Apple. They tried to slime George Soros because he said negative things. They hired this horrible group of people called The Definers, who believe in sort of aggressive ...The Definers? Is that a cult where everyone\u2019s wearing Nikes and then drinking cyanide?I know, they just wander around. And the guy from The Definers quoted, \u201cWe like to muddy the waters.\u201d He just said it. Like, good. That\u2019s what he does. So it was fine that he said it on the record.But right now the \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorrys\u201d just are not going to cut it. Once again, like with Beacon, or whatever thing that Facebook does that\u2019s shitty, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is not good enough now. And what\u2019s really interesting is what the repercussions will be. First, they\u2019ll be personal repercussions on all these executives, especially Sheryl Sandberg. There\u2019s no question.What does that look like, though? I was thinking this morning, we\u2019re all going to be in violent agreement.Getting dumped from things. Getting dumped from committees. Especially around the anti- \u2026 the stuff around George Soros, and the sliming. All right. Getting dumped from lots of groups, I think, one. Or boards, or something like that. I do think that might be coming. Just not wanting to be affiliated with them.Two, and it depends on what comes out after this, because once this floodgate opens that the New York Times has opened, more is going to come. All of a sudden, everyone\u2019s going to drop a dime on everybody. Yeah, I agree.So then that\u2019s the repercussions of everybody dropping more dimes, and you know there\u2019s emails and everything else, so that\u2019s one thing.The second thing, which I think is more serious, and Facebook put out a statement this morning about it, saying that one part of when they knew was incorrect in the New York Times story because they have testified before Congress, and these politicians coming after them, and they were already coming after them, is going to increase exponentially. And Facebook\u2019s attempt to push it off onto Google or Twitter or others is just not going to work. They are the target of these politicians, and you know that Senator Warner, Senator Burr, Senator Klobuchar and various congresspeople are going to just come at these people real hard, and that\u2019s really the danger, to me.But when it comes after them ...I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just worse.... is it antitrust? Is it regulation?It could be any. It\u2019s going to be worse now. This is going to be worse.Now, the issue is ... Let me be fair to Facebook. They\u2019ve done a lot of things since then to fix stuff. Like, I think they\u2019re announcing some stuff soon about more to do it, but they\u2019ve been doing a lot to fix it. It\u2019s just that Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and I quote it in a column I\u2019m doing for the New York Times this week \u2014 he cannot focus on what happened. He only wants to focus on fixing things, as if he ... It\u2019s like you said, an arsonist cleaning up the mess or something. That wasn\u2019t you, that was Anand, but you know, the idea that they\u2019re the ones to clean this mess up.Yeah. What surprises me is that people are surprised, because this is an individual ... And I like your point about ... You know, the fear is, all right, big tech.... and all of a sudden, what might happen is we fire the woman. Right? There\u2019s only one woman who\u2019s the senior executive, and all of a sudden she\u2019s about to become ... I think she was unfairly protected, but I wonder if she\u2019s about to be unfairly punished, to your point. I think it\u2019s an interesting point, because you\u2019re right. He\u2019s responsible. He\u2019s the CEO. And the controlling shareholder.Yeah, and he controls the company, but I\u2019m a little surprised that people are surprised that he\u2019s not their Jesus Christ, because look at his background. All right? He dropped out of college. He screwed over his close friends in college. Then he royally screwed over his best friend soon after he started Facebook. His first professional endeavor was a website that evaluated women on their physical appearance, and he last year proposed a third class of stocks that said he could sell all his stock in Facebook and still control a flock more vast than Christianity. I mean, what could go wrong? Doesn\u2019t this person just reek of poor character, and been totally insular? It\u2019s hard to imagine how a guy like this who became a billionaire so young, became so powerful, doesn\u2019t become totally insular and detached.I remember that interview you did where he started sweating like a maniac when he just didn\u2019t understand that people were worried about him knowing a lot of information about them, and he just seemed totally flummoxed by the whole thing. I\u2019m just surprised that people give him as much credit, that they\u2019re shocked that this stuff is going on. Because the article, some of it\u2019s really ugly, but isn\u2019t it just more of the same?Yes.Isn\u2019t it everything we already knew?Yes, it is. It is. It is. It is. This is something ... This is why I\u2019ve been going crazy about this for so long is because they literally are the personification of this group-think in Silicon Valley that everything they do is bathed in gold. Every decision they make. And they live in violent agreement with each other. You can see it in the lack of diversity. You can see it in the lack of ... Without a lot of voices in the room. Now, they say they disagree, but they don\u2019t. There\u2019s nobody putting brakes on any of these people, because we treat them like boy kings. It\u2019s as if my teenagers were running the show, you know what I mean? And, by the way, my 13-year-old would do a better job, honestly.I agree.Because they think about these things.I think whether this has repercussions ... And we should move onto the next thing. Whether this has repercussions, here\u2019s the deal. Young people aren\u2019t using this product as much, and the issue is that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see it. Is it going to affect advertising? Is it going to affect usage and stuff like that? And I do think there is a lot of risk with Congressional inquiries into this.I think you\u2019re half right. I think that a red state DA or kind of a flyer might be a small Latin American nation or small northern European nation just outright bans Facebook.Well, yeah, Margrethe Vestager\u2019s been so strong on this for years.Yeah, but you might see someone like Uruguay just say, you know what, we\u2019re banning Facebook where you just can\u2019t have it here. You could see a country just go gangster on these guys.In terms of the actual business, I always maintain that people talk a big game about being angry at Facebook and where do they go to express their outrage? Instagram.Instagram, right. I actually don\u2019t see the business letting up and advertisers don\u2019t really have any choice.I don\u2019t know, with the Kevin Systrom, I wrote about that with him leaving, I thought that was a very bad sign.Yeah, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see their business decelerating, that\u2019s the weird thing.I\u2019m gonna disagree with you on this.There\u2019s a dissonance here, but where does P&G and Unilever go? If they decided to pull their advertising from Facebook and Instagram.Listen, we\u2019ve seen this before with AOL. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve seen it.Hold on, they\u2019d be lauded for their noble, principled stand and then their stock would go down three to five percent the next day \u2018cause everyone would wonder how they\u2019re gonna drive traffic to tide.com. These guys have no choice. This is a danger of a monopoly or duopoly, advertisers don\u2019t have any choice.We\u2019ll see. These things die very slowly but this is not, these are not good directionals \u2018cause the question is if they fire anybody, which they won\u2019t. The lack of accountability. The very least, this lawyer Joel Kaplan in Washington seems quite ... his misjudgments are quite perplexing to me, including sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh at the hearings. Talk about conflict of interest. This is a person who\u2019s Facebook\u2019s person in Washington. And he can have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, just keep it to himself. On both sides, by the way, speaking of, I can\u2019t believe I used that term.But it\u2019s just, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see. I\u2019m gonna disagree. I think this is a really bad.I have a couple of questions, though, from a person who\u2019s not a journalist but a commentator. You\u2019re a journalist. Couple things stood out in the article to me. First is, they\u2019re clearly going after each other. Yes.That is clearly ... the board members went off the record.Erskine Bowles. Erskine Bowles was very angry, it looked like in that story.And he\u2019s clearly ...I heard that.Going on background.Well I don\u2019t know. Guessing.Or somebody is.I would guess, yes.Information\u2019s coming out of the boardroom.Yes, that\u2019s what ... The dime dropping is going to be the problem. I haven\u2019t even looked at my emails today. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s 20 dimes dropping into Kara Swisher\u2019s email.And a couple political ramifications, I believed until about a month ago that Sheryl Sandberg was probably one of the five or six most likely nominees for the Democratic nomination for president.I said no. Ugh, no, you\u2019re wrong.I think she was planning to run for president ...No.And then ...You\u2019re wrong.That\u2019s done now. The other thing is, I think Charles Schumer just got himself a competitor for his next election.I agree.He looks terrible here.I\u2019d have to say, I noted, I did a podcast with him in which he kept praising Facebook and I was like, \u201cWhat are you talking about? They\u2019re a disaster.\u201d It was, I put up the exchange today on Twitter and at the time, I was perplexed by it.But now that he went after Warner and Burr, now I get it. Or Warner, I guess. Just Warner, \u2018cause he\u2019s on his side, but I was, at the time, I literally finished the podcast and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat was that? He has no sense that there is some issues here with this company.\u201d Then I thought, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just a luddite.\u201d You know what I mean? Maybe he just doesn\u2019t get it, but I guess he got it. I agree.Last thing, the scariest thing I thought about the article \u2014 and you tell me what you thought the most disturbing thing \u2026 the fact that they actually fomented the notion that Soros was behind this.Yes, it was. Man...Oh my gosh. They\u2019re trading in conspiracy theories.The Definers.It\u2019s just wow, that is really, I mean, that is the stuff of a movie.Gotta tell you, how much of an asshole do you have to be to call yourself The Definers?The Definers. Yeah, that sounds like a bad \u201970s rock band.\u201cWe\u2019re the Definers.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re The Definers. Our latest hit ...\u201dYes.\u201cNext up, The Definers.\u201dYou can see them sitting \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s gonna be all guys sitting there going, \u201cThat\u2019s a cool name.\u201d No woman would sit there and go, \u201cYeah, I call myself The Definer.\u201dThe Definers. That is dudes.Oh my god.Yeah, that\u2019s dudes.Jeez Louise. All right.What was the scariest thing in your mind that came out of that article? What was the most shocking thing?Oh, I gotta read it again. I gotta take notes. The dirty tricks. I saw them react like petty assholes to a lot of stuff, but this was like whoa. Then I remembered what they did a couple years ago against Google. They fomented a fake kinda thing at Google and got in trouble for it. Then I remember calling, I remember when they did that.I, again, shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The dirty tricks are very disappointing and the treatment of Alex Stamos \u2014 who I know pretty well, who I knew at Yahoo had tried to uncover a lot of hacking stuff \u2014 I don\u2019t think he ... he probably should have told them quicker and stuff like that, but instead of focusing on the fact that he didn\u2019t tell them quicker or tell them correctly, was that versus, \u201cOh my god, we have a leak.\u201dBut he\u2019s clearly the whistleblower here, right?Oh yeah.He\u2019s the person who called the Times. He comes out of this actually looking pretty good.He\u2019s talked a lot. He\u2019s been on podcasts and stuff like that. He\u2019s now at Stanford teaching. I like him a lot. I\u2019ve dealt with him a lot when he was at Yahoo. A lot of these CEOs wanna cover up this stuff or find a way to make it less horrible and he\u2019s not one of them, it seemed like it. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s talking to who, but clearly, there\u2019s 50 people talking here. There\u2019s gonna be 500 people talking now.All right, next thing. Let\u2019s go into an ad break. We\u2019re gonna take a quick break and when we get back, we\u2019ll talk more.In the next advertiser segment, brought to you by Quickbooks, we\u2019ll hear from a business owner who turned their side hustle into a full time career. Thanks to the sponsor of our show, Quickbooks for Nat\u2019s story. Learn more at Quickbooks.com, that\u2019s Quickbooks.com, now back to our show with Scott Galloway.All right, Scott, that was the overplayed, sorry, it\u2019s not overplayed by any stretch, but what\u2019s the most under-reported story this week?Sure, I think a pretty big deal is that Apple has decided to officially distribute their iPhones on Amazon.Mm-hmm. That is a big deal. It didn\u2019t get a lot of attention, you\u2019re right. It did not.Yeah, effectively, one of the keys to building a brand is your distribution, right? Hermes doesn\u2019t distribute through Walmart. Levis, Red Tab won\u2019t even distribute through J.C. Penney. Actually, they\u2019re in J.C. Penney but they won\u2019t distribute through orange tab through different points of distribution \u2018cause you wanna line up, right?Macy\u2019s won\u2019t carry anything that\u2019s in Sears. The distribution has a big impact on a consumer\u2019s perception of your brand. Apple, the ultimate luxury brand, is now on Amazon. That\u2019s a big move. I believe that it\u2019s another signal that Apple has jumped the shark and we\u2019re at peak Apple.Really? Okay. Talk about that.If you were to say what is the most value creative decision in the history of business, most people would say it\u2019s Apple\u2019s introduction of the iPhone.Okay.The rocket ship that took them to a trillion. I think they get the brand right, but the decision wrong. I think the ultimate gangster move here that created the first trillion dollar company was Apple\u2019s decision to take literally billions of dollars out of broadcast advertising.They actually under-indexed on advertising to pour into this dying medium called stores. They have made these temples to the brand that are just mindblowing in terms of how good they are and how good you feel about ...I still am happy in an Apple store, I have to say. I was just in one.They\u2019re wonderful. Then if you buy an Android phone \u2014 back to Android \u2014 you go into a place with bad lighting with a guy named Roy and he sells you an Android phone and all you can think about is going back to the Apple store.Yeah.Distribution is ...They should have food at the Apple store, don\u2019t you think?They should have a cafeteria there. I\u2019d live there.I would live there.I would like to live there.I would work there.Anyways, they ... Incredible, incredible bold decision to create, I think they have $7 billion or $8 billion in leases, 500 and whatever 50 stores around. When they go into Amazon, I think they\u2019re basically saying we need the growth and they\u2019re denigrating their distribution. I worry over time ...That\u2019s a fair point.If it\u2019s the beginning of the end of their margin.That is an interesting point you make.Their margin support.I think I agree. They gotta sell more iPhones. I do think about that. I didn\u2019t really buy the new iPhone. I didn\u2019t. It just wasn\u2019t enough. You know what I mean? I probably will, probably get to it. I was on that year plan I don\u2019t understand whatsoever. I\u2019ll probably replace them in some way, my kids too. But you\u2019re right, I think they have to sell more, and obviously the issues in China where they\u2019ve been having a lot of growth are gonna be myriad going forward, especially with these tariffs and trade talks. That is, if the Trump people can stop being in the reality show of attacking each other every day inside the White House, if they can focus on it. But some of this China stuff I think is problematic for them.Then there is the question of whether they have a new product that\u2019s really exciting that I will spend more money on. I will spend more money to maintain my Apple presence, but is there something exciting that I would spend a lot of money on?Everyone talks about services, but this is gonna be really interesting because even Nike, which you\u2019d argue is one of the best brands in the world, when they had decided to officially distribute or eliminate a number of SKUs on Amazon, it didn\u2019t work. Even Nike couldn\u2019t force Amazon to clean up all the gray market stuff, unauthorized distribution.I\u2019ve bought Apple things on Amazon. I have.Accessories though, right? Or refurbished phone?Yeah, accessories. Not refurbished phones. I don\u2019t buy refurbished phones.Yeah.Sorry, my friend.This is a fairly big deal but it\u2019ll be interesting ...I agree.To see if it works \u2018cause typically ...Under-reported, I agree with you on this.Typically, Amazon, they always say ... Amazon says we\u2019re partnering with Apple and Apple says we\u2019re partnering with Amazon. Typically, Amazon partners with a brand the way a virus partners with a host, and that is, it works out really well for one of them. I\u2019ll be curious if this works for Apple, and it\u2019ll be reported kinda six months in what happened.Right. My only unreported thing is today the Saudi prosecutor seeks death penalty for five people allegedly involved in the journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death. I mean, honestly, this was reported a lot but it sort of fell off the pages during the midterms. But, honestly, these people ... What I tweeted was the lying liars have lied, what a surprise and they\u2019re thugs. Again, good luck taking their money, Uber and others. I just think it should ...Basically these are the five guys ...This is what we should keep reporting on. The witnesses who are gonna be killed, yes, that is what they are. They\u2019re the fall guys. Basically, they were doing their job.We\u2019ll see.They were sent to assassinate someone and they did what they ...I don\u2019t know. Hopefully not. Hopefully these people will bang at it and remains a reported story and they link it to the higher parts of the government. There\u2019s no question to me that these people don\u2019t breathe without permission. You know what I mean? In these countries, especially. To pretend ... Again, someone died. In this case it was an actual murder, but nothing happens at the top of any of these companies or any of these countries without these people knowing, I\u2019m sorry.Yeah, someone knowing.And pretending like you\u2019re some adult, I just don\u2019t ... You know, one of the things that was interesting in that New York Times piece, I had had a problem with Mark answering my questions about the impact of his inventions on real people and about people dying. In the New York Times piece, the board got really frustrated when they were revealing the Russia problems, he whirred through solutions without discussing why it happened.You know what I mean? The same thing. It\u2019s the same idea and they were very frustrated by, it\u2019s whirring was the ... That\u2019s what he does. He whirs. Anyway, it was interesting.Should we talk about a win of the week? I wanna plug something.Win of the week, yes, let\u2019s do that. Win of the week, go ahead.My colleague at NY Eastern, Jonathan Haidt, who is just this rockstar thinker.Is this the guy I wrote the ... which book did he write?\u201dThe Coddling of the American Mind.\u201dCoddling, yes, coddling.It just came out. I should have him on the podcast.It is so ... oh, you should. He\u2019s fantastic. Mm-hmm.And it\u2019s really fantastic research. It shows that the rise of smartphones in combination with sort of this bulldozer concierge parenting where we clear out all the obstacles for our kids has created a generation of kids who\u2019ve never been safer \u2014 there\u2019s less drunk driving, there\u2019s less teen pregnancies \u2014 but we\u2019ve also created the most emotionally venerable generation. And they get to college and they\u2019re hugely depressed. Interesting.And you can literally track this generation and now there\u2019s these ... there\u2019s colleges, including my alma mater, that are dis-inviting speakers because they\u2019re offensive.Oh, right.They\u2019re worried they will be traumatized.Oh, this is this gang who just cares about people ... oh come on, this is not our biggest problem. I\u2019m gonna disagree with you on this one. I hate all these writers that write about this. I will read his book, but I don\u2019t think them not being about to hear speakers ...We\u2019re creating a nation of snowflakes.Oh, come on. That\u2019s what college students do.We\u2019re creating a generation of snowflakes. They\u2019re a pain in the ass. These people are like, \u201cOh, we can\u2019t speak at colleges.\u201dThey\u2019re dis-invited.Like oh, I\u2019m a victim. Oh, the mob of Twitter. Oh come on.They dis-invited Sam Zell. Oh, well. I mean, is he really that bad?I don\u2019t know.I mean, for God\u2019s sake, learn from the guy. But that\u2019s what ... that happens in colleges all the time. I don\u2019t know. I just, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s our national crisis the way some of these writers have gone.You have students yelling down professors.Oh, no. Oh, you\u2019re kidding.In class and where does that happen? It happens on the East Coast. It happens on the West Coast where we have ...I don\u2019t care.... we have wealthy parents coddling their kids. So, I have a question. I know your 13-year-old is in the other room. Are you a coddler?No, I\u2019m not a coddler.I\u2019m a total coddler.Not me, no.Oh, my gosh I\u2019m a total coddler.And here\u2019s why, let me just say if someone yells someone down, they yell someone down. Who cares, Scott? Honestly, this is not our greatest crisis of America.Oh, I can\u2019t handle it. Literally, in America where everyone gets to blah all the freaking time, these people are complaining about not getting to blah. Oh, no, not that. It\u2019s the slippery ...So my dog ...They say the word slippery slope, I\u2019m gonna push them down the slippery slope. We have a Vizsla, and whenever my wife and I argue, the dog senses it and it goes upstairs. It just can\u2019t handle controversy.I\u2019m just telling you you\u2019re wrong.And I\u2019m the same way. When my wife goes after one of our kids, I freak out and I have to go upstairs. I don\u2019t can\u2019t handle it. And I realize ...They dis-invited people, so what?She is doing what they need to do. One of Jonathan Haidt\u2019s great analogies is that ...I\u2019ve heard this book is good.We have so many ... we\u2019re trying so hard using so many clean wipes around our kids\u2019 lives to disinfect them that they\u2019re not building the immunities they need.Yes, okay.I thought that was an outstanding.That is probably true, that is true. That is true.That was an outstanding analogy.That is a good analogy.I was bullied a little bit. I don\u2019t know if you were bullied.No.But I look back on it ... Oh, really? I was.Never. Not once. You did the bullying.I did not. I protected people from bullies. Wow. That\u2019s outstanding.I ran the playground, Scott. What do you think? Hello. I ran it so well.I can totally see that. I can totally see that.It was tight. I ran a tight playground.I\u2019m running your ass over in the Fiesta. So, yeah, but I think you learn coping mechanisms and when I see what happens at my kids\u2019 school, they literally ... there is just so much emphasis on protection and it may have gone too far.I\u2019m a more \u201csuck it up, sister\u201d mother type of thing.Good for you. Alex is gonna ... we\u2019re all gonna work for Alex. Alex and Louie, they\u2019re lovely. That\u2019s true. That is absolutely true, 100 percent.So Jonathan Haidt, \u201cThe Coddling of the American Mind.\u201d I get that. An outstanding book.The only thing I\u2019m gonna say is these intellectual dark web people exhaust me with their whining. Stop, like if you say stupid things, you\u2019re gonna get people attacking you. When I say stupid things on the web, people attack me. That is the game. If they want to be famous, they have to suck it up.Yeah, but there is a ... I do think there is a Princess and the Pea construct.Suck it up.Where all of a sudden everybody is just so offended and so angry at everything. Too bad.And the moment you\u2019re a victim, you\u2019re right. If you\u2019re offended by something, you\u2019re automatically right.Oh, suck it up.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the way it should be. Suck it up, Scott. Suck it up.Well, right back at you. Suck it up. I\u2019m gonna suck it up. I suck it up all the time. Snowflake. Snowflakey. I\u2019m not snow. I don\u2019t care either way. I don\u2019t care if people like me or dislike me. I do not care. It\u2019s fine if they want to bar me from things, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not gonna get all indignant. I\u2019m not gonna have a hissy.By the way, my brain almost exploded today.I can see you having a hissy.I was about to go on ... I was getting miked up to be on MSNBC and I look up and you\u2019re there on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d I was ... I did it two weeks ago or a week ago. Yeah. That was timing.That was tape recorded?Timing is beautiful.Wow, it seemed very timely. I know, with the chemical spill and everything. I look like a genius. I look like a freaking genius, I do.By the way, and you\u2019re gonna hate this question, is there just a ton of sexual energy between those two?There is. I\u2019m sorry to say.I\u2019m about ... they\u2019re about to throw down on the desk.There is energy. Oh my god.They did, they kissed for me. Go look at my Twitter, they kissed for me. I put it on Twitter.Oh my god. They\u2019re so hot. I would like to see them have sex. I\u2019ve got to say people were like ... they have a lot of detractors on Twitter, when I put that picture up. I was like, \u201cYou know what? I had the most fun at that place.\u201d They\u2019re dreamy.I am down with their whole jam. I am good with their jam. Their jam is good. I get why you don\u2019t like it. I do, so just butt out. Same thing.Nah.All right, any ... the only thing I would say for the thing that was the win was the forced arbitration thing that moved from Google to Facebook. Facebook and Airbnb. Fail. Last quick fail and then we\u2019ll go. Fail. What\u2019s the fail?Quick fail. Oh come on.Facebook, Amazon.It\u2019s gotta be, it\u2019s Facebook stuff. I know everyone\u2019s piling on, but this is just really discouraging. It\u2019s upsetting. It really is upsetting. Fail. Facebook, I hope we have the backbone and our elected officials have the backbone to do more than just whine and actually address this problem.I think the fail this week was Sarah Sanders, the editing of that video. When they had that video.Oh my gosh.That to me was ... and taking away the press.Speeding it up. And then Kellyanne Conway?I love that Fox is on CNN\u2019s side. I know.Then Kellyanne Conway said, \u201cWait, they do that on ESPN all the time.\u201d It\u2019s like slo-mo replay or something.Oh my god. Really?You know who I love though? Her husband. George Conway. Speaking of marriage jams that I love. That\u2019s awesome.He\u2019s now formed a group. It\u2019s called like ... it has some fantastic legal name. What is it? It\u2019s like Definers but it\u2019s good. It\u2019s ... what is it?I think it\u2019s the key to their marriage. I think that\u2019s foreplay. Oh my god, Scott. They are so like five minutes from divorce or something.I think he goes out and he says something and she comes home and she says, \u201cIf you say that again ... \u201c, and then they go at it. No, no.I think it\u2019s total foreplay.Scott, Scott. Oh my god. I\u2019m trying to keep this clean and you always manage to bring in like ...Do you think he has an Android phone? Do you think that\u2019s killing his vibe?Anti-Trump club. He\u2019s competing with the Federalist Society and it\u2019s called, hold on ... oh wait, this is such a good name.Do you know Kellyanne Conway? Do you know her?I have never met her. Checks and Balances. Oh my god, the group is called Checks and Balances started by George Conway. I love him.Checks and Balances. I love him. I would like to be his friend. I would like to go to their house for dinner. If they would invite me, I\u2019m here in D.C. Conways, George Conway, I have a man crush on you, like I can\u2019t stand with this Checks and Balances. It is so good. It\u2019s better than The Definers. I would not want to get in the way of Kellyanne Conway. You better be careful there. You might disappear.You know what? I can ... Don\u2019t worry about it.Seriously.I just want to be his best friend. I just want to hang with him.You want to roll with him?Yes. There is a great profile in the Washington Post about the two of them that is brilliant. It\u2019s a brilliant depiction and since then I\u2019ve just been ... they\u2019ve been my like Kardashians, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, all right, Scott. It\u2019s time to get out of here. This is a lively one this week. I will see you next week.Last thing. I know I keep expanding this. The most interesting thing that came out of your Benioff interview?Oh, that\u2019s coming on Sunday. Yes, the stuff about the homeless. I think he has been pushing this shaming, some people think of him as a blowhard. I asked him that directly. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s ... he\u2019s a good blowhard as far as I\u2019m concerned and he\u2019s pushing on the homeless stuff and pushing for them to give money and to take their hands off of their giant sums of cash and hand it out to people less fortunate and look for solutions, because it\u2019s not an easy solution in San Francisco, the homeless problem. It\u2019s not ... nobody looks good. The whole gang doesn\u2019t look good there, but these people with money and means and ideas should be part of the solution, and I like that. Go Marc.Go Marc, in this case.Superhero Marc.The best part was his shirt.He looks like a guy you want to hug. He\u2019s very big and huggable. He\u2019s big. He\u2019s like 6\u20195\u201d. He\u2019s really tall.That\u2019s a big dude. He was like eating food. He brought David Blaine. I don\u2019t know why he was there.The magician?Yeah. I said, \u201cThe magician?\u201d And he goes, \u201cWell, he\u2019s a person too.\u201d David Blaine?I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, but he\u2019s a magician.\u201d He was there. I don\u2019t know why. He had a crew. He brought David Blaine. Whatever. He was late and he brought David Blaine, so there you have it. Whatever. Wow.We had a great time. It was at the top of Salesforce Tower. You could see the ... speaking of the fires, you could see the fires and the smoke ... the smoke from the fires. It was ...Yeah, speaking of under-reported, right?No. That\u2019s been reported.Literally California is on fire and there\u2019s just so much chaos, we barely notice.It\u2019s very sad. I was there for two days.It is sad.It was hard to breathe. I actually felt like I was in Beijing or something. It was really sad and it cast a pall over the whole city and the people dying. The extent of it has not been known and it\u2019s sad that entire towns have been decimated and people have died in just terrible circumstances. Actually that\u2019s another fail of the week. I know I\u2019m all out here, to come out and say that the Forestry Service is at fault here.Oh don\u2019t even. Don\u2019t even.I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOkay, I live in Florida. Are all the hurricanes the Forestry Service\u2019s fault as well?\u201d It\u2019s just ... that\u2019s just so ...That was a depressing moment, but again, what a surprise. Yeah. There we go.Anyway, it\u2019s time to get out of here. I will thank you for doing it. We\u2019ll look forward to talking next week.
