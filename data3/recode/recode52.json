And then I think also it could be pretty helpful for maybe expanding our civilization,\u201d Musk told Kara Swisher on a new episode of Recode Decode. \u201cI do think it will become obvious over time that a Space Force is a sensible thing to do.\u201dDonald Trump pitched the new military operation this year and hopes to have it running by 2020, bringing the military into conversation with space leaders like NASA and Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It would sit alongside branches like the Army and the Air Force.Musk described the agency as similar to the Air Force, something he said was criticized as unnecessary when air wars were managed by the Army but which is now a specialized division.\u201cAnd people today may not realize back then it was wildly panned as a ridiculous thing to create the Air Force, but now everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Obviously you should have an Air Force,\u2019\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s gonna become obvious that we should have a Space Force, too.\u201dMusk predicted that his support for the Space Force would be \u201ca little controversial.\u201d He has been a critic of Trump \u2014 he served on two White House business advisory councils, but quit after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord \u2014 but he did display some Trump-like rhetoric at one point in the conversation, when criticizing people on the left who don\u2019t use electric cars.\u201cIt sort of blows my mind \u2014 all these social justice warriors driving around in diesel cars,\u201d Musk said in an aside. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201dYou can listen to the entire conversation right now in the audio player below.
