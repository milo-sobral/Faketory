{"id": "San Francisco\u2019s Prop C homelessness tax was a big win for Marc Benioff, but legal challenges may be coming", "paragraph": "Tuesday night was considered a sweeping victory for supporters of San Francisco\u2019s homelessness tax, Proposition C, after the measure won 60 percent of the popular vote. But it looks as though the battle has only just begun.Proposition C will raise the city\u2019s gross receipts tax on companies by an average of .5 percent on annual gross receipts over $50 million, with funds earmarked toward helping the homeless. Opponents are challenging the results of the election, saying that it needed to pass by two-thirds instead of a simple majority in order to stand on solid legal ground \u2014 an assertion that is not supported by the city attorney\u2019s office. The risk of legal action is now causing uncertainty among San Francisco city leaders over whether they should spend the estimated $250 million to $300 million a year the tax will bring in, since they might have to give that money back if any legal challenges are successful.Citing \u201ccurrent legal uncertainties associated with the measure,\u201d the city controller\u2019s office sent a letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed saying that it will collect taxes for Prop C beginning in 2020 but hold off on spending the funds until there\u2019s further clarity. That\u2019s assuming that current election results remain final in the coming weeks \u2014 if the numbers change (not likely) and Prop C actually has two-thirds of the vote, then a legal challenge becomes moot.Getting this resolved by the courts could take years, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, and Prop C\u2019s funding for the homeless would be sit unused in the meantime. Breed, who opposed Prop C, discussed the implications of that possibility in a press conference Wednesday.\u201cThere\u2019s still some uncertainty around Prop C. We\u2019re not sure when the funds will be available to be used,\u201d she said at the press conference, which was posted online by NBC.  \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for Prop C to go through the court systems in order to act.\u201d she said. Breed also wrote in a press release Wednesday that she agrees with voters that the city should build more housing and shelters and that \u201cbusiness can pay more to make that happen.\u201dSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff, one of Prop C\u2019s biggest supporters, dismissed legal concerns.\u201cThe people have spoken. It\u2019s a 60 percent landslide victory for them,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of a meeting with reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThere can always be legal challenges, but the reality is that the city needs to go ahead and now implement Proposition C \u2014 it\u2019s the will of the people,\u201d he said. The argument boils down to a legal question about whether special tax measures like Prop C require a two-thirds vote or just a simple majority to pass. Currently, there are two pending cases over previous San Francisco ballot measures that could either strengthen or weaken Prop C\u2019s legal footing. Because Prop C received 60 percent of the vote, it would fall short of a hypothetical two-thirds requirement \u2014 but whether that\u2019s necessary is up for debate. Jess Montejano, a spokesperson for the No on C campaign, which is led by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a statement that the city ultimately won\u2019t \u201csee a penny\u201d from the measure because the vote didn\u2019t result in a two-thirds majority.So far, opponents of Prop C have not formally filed a lawsuit on the matter, but San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera has said that if they did, his office would defend the popular vote. \u201cWe take our duty to protect the will of the voters very seriously. A clear majority of voters passed Proposition C, and we will defend their decision in court,\u201d Herrera wrote in an email to Recode sent by a spokesperson. Tech\u2019s opponents of Prop C have largely stayed out of the conversation after the vote.Square spokesman Aaron Zamost \u2014 Square, along with Stripe, was one of the most vocal opponents of Prop C \u2014 declined to comment on whether the company supports potential legal challenges to Prop C, saying, \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with City Hall to build a better San Francisco.\u201d Stripe spokeswoman Kelly Sims declined to comment, pointing to the company\u2019s previous statements in opposition to Prop C.
