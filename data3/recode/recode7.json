{"id": "Brandless wants to create the next great consumer packaged goods brand \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t built customer loyalty yet", "paragraph": "When Brandless launched in the summer of 2017, it aimed to disrupt the $760 billion U.S. consumer packaged goods industry by offering low-cost, high-quality home products and non-perishable foods.So far, that disruption hasn\u2019t been felt by major CPG retailers.The startup now sells more than 350 \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d products, ranging from non-GMO gummy candy to stainless-steel can openers, most priced at $3. They are banking on millennial buyers who want more transparency in their products and who believe in Brandless\u2019 mission, which it advertises as \u201cdeeply rooted in quality, transparency, and community-driven values.\u201dThis summer, the company received $240 million in funding from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund, which valued the company at over $500 million. For a consumer-focused company as young as Brandless, that\u2019s an incredibly rare and large investment (and why we\u2019re paying attention to a fledging e-commerce brand). It\u2019s also risky, since Brandless has entered a highly competitive space with little room for error. On the competition front, Amazon continues to expand its Amazon Basics line of products \u2014 which total more than 1,000 today \u2014and Walmart\u2019s Jet has its own brand called Uniquely J. Just this month, Target announced 70 items under its own label, Smartly, which cost just $2 each \u2014 undercutting Brandless\u2019 $3 price point.Thus far, Brandless doesn\u2019t have a notable market share in any of its product categories. Perhaps more importantly, people who do buy from Brandless don\u2019t seem to be purchasing from them again at the same rate as some of its competitors, according to data from two third-party sources.Of customers who bought from Brandless for the first time in the final quarter of 2017, 20 percent made another purchase in the following quarter and just 13 percent bought something three quarters later. That\u2019s according to new data from Edison Trends, which tracks email receipts for three million U.S. consumers.  For the following charts we looked at data for new Brandless customers in Q3 and Q4 of 2017 so we could view several subsequent quarters of data. People who\u2019ve made their first purchases in more recent quarters had levels of retention similar to these. That puts Brandless in line with Walmart.com and Target.com, which might seem like good company, but those retailers still do the vast majority of their sales in brick-and-mortar stores. That makes their online retention rates not quite as critical to current success, though they\u2019d certainly prefer higher retention rates as well.But Brandless\u2019 retention rates fall far below those of Amazon, Instacart or even Thrive Market, another young better-for-you e-commerce retailer that specializes in discounted natural and organic goods.Brandless, a private company, would not provide any data but said their internal numbers paint a better picture.Edison\u2019s retention levels, however, were consistent with data from Second Measure, a firm that analyzes billions of dollars worth of anonymized debit and credit card purchases. Second Measure found that only 11 percent of new Brandless customers in Q3 2017 were still making purchases a year later. Last quarter, Brandless customers made an average of 1.34 transactions.Retention matters especially for companies like Brandless because it trades in inexpensive goods that need to be repurchased frequently. Low customer retention means customers aren\u2019t coming back.\u201cThey are new and building awareness and therefore focused on customer acquisition, so their [retention] number won\u2019t be anywhere near a mass merchant\u2019s,\u201d said Sucharita Kodali, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research.This problem, of course, is not unique to Brandless. \u201cAcross most commerce sites, overwhelmingly purchases are one-time,\u201d according to Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce at digital marketing agency SapientRazorfish. \u201cEvery time I have a new client the problem is, how do we move from one purchase to two? How do we develop a habit around buying that product?\u201d Brandless\u2019 limited offerings, however, hinder it in that department. A person shopping on Amazon or Walmart.com or Target.com might buy kitchenware one month and a TV the next. Big-box stores carry about 100,000 products while Amazon sells hundreds of millions. It\u2019s difficult to compete in scale. \u201cIf you only have one kind of thing, it\u2019s less attractive for everyday use or every quarter use,\u201d said Noble Kuriakose, VP of data at Edison.And versions of Brandless\u2019 products, while inexpensive and purportedly of better quality, can be found at all its competitors. The company also doesn\u2019t sell fresh-food products, which are more difficult to store and transport but need to be purchased more frequently.Brandless finds itself in the uncomfortable middle ground of not being niche enough and not being broad enough \u2014 yet. It is, however, trying distinguish itself with wholesome ingredients and progressive politics.\u201cThe key for Brandless will be whether they\u2019ll be able to stay true to their purpose over time as they extend their product assortment and deliver more comprehensive offerings,\u201d said PwC Consumer Markets Leader Steve Barr. Currently, online shoppers are also spending less on Brandless goods than at its competitors. The average Brandless order size was $34 last quarter, according to Edison. That\u2019s below its peers and even below its own free-shipping minimum of $39 for non-members.Small shopping carts wouldn\u2019t matter as much if customers were coming back frequently.
