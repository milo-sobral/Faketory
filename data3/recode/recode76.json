{"id": "Google has responded to its employees\u2019 demands about sexual misconduct. Here are the changes it will and won\u2019t make.", "paragraph": "Last week, 20,000 Google employees around the world walked out of work to protest the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct claims, in one of the largest instances of tech worker collective action in history. Today, Google CEO Sundar Pichai formally responded to employees\u2019 concerns.Overall, organizers gained some wins in their demands. Helping to put an end to forced arbitration in sexual misconduct cases is a major change that could have a ripple effect across other large companies.But some of the workers\u2019 demands were unmet or only partially addressed. \u201cWe commend this progress, and the rapid action which brought it about,\u201d wrote the Google walkout organizers in a statement this afternoon. But they said the company must also address \u201cissues of systemic racism and discrimination, including pay equity and rates of promotion, and not just sexual harassment alone.\u201dThere are also still some unanswered questions about the specifics of management\u2019s proposed changes, especially whether they apply in full to the temporary, vendor and contract workers who make up a significant chunk of Google\u2019s workforce. Those workers didn\u2019t receive the email this morning about the policies and were not invited to the town hall meeting to discuss them, according to a statement from the advocacy group Tech Workers Coalition, which includes employees at Google. Temporary, vendor and contract workers are not normally invited to Google company meetings like TGIFs and All Hands, according to a spokesperson from the company.Below is a summarized list of the organizers\u2019 demands (which you can find in more detail here) and how they are \u2014 or are not \u2014 being met, based on the company\u2019s response in an action plan document it released this morning.Google did not address the demand to share compensation data with employees. It did make some commitments to changing its hiring practices at the director level and above to increase diversity.The company said it will commit to having a \u201ddiverse slate of candidates on the interview short list\u201d for new or vacated positions. Still, the company said there will be some \u201climited exceptions\u201d for highly specialized roles that require unique skills. Those exceptions need to be approved by both the VP-level hiring manager and VP of staffing and operations.3. A publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report. Google didn\u2019t concede to a public sexual harassment report but did make commitments to provide some details about sexual harassment incidents to employees.In their demands, employees asked the company for the number of harassment claims at Google over time. Management agreed to this, but only for \u201csubstantiated or partially substantiated claims.\u201d A substantiated claim is what the investigation team is able to prove through evidence, according to a Google spokesperson. The company also didn\u2019t specify if it would include other information requested, such as types of claims submitted, how many victims and accused have left Google, and if the accused received exit packages.4. A clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct. Google will create a new Internal Investigations Practice Guide that explains how sexual misconduct concerns are handled at the company, with input from employees who have made complaints previously.One key ask from the walkout organizers was for management to allow employees to be accompanied by a companion in meetings related to HR investigations involving harassment or discrimination. Google did promise to establish a process to allow that. The company will also offer new support services for employees who make sexual harassment claims, including providing them with counseling.Google also said it will create a specialty team of advisers on the Employee Relations team \u2014 which is part of HR \u2014 to look into all sexual harassment and discrimination concerns. 5. Promote the chief diversity officer to answer directly to the CEO. In addition, appoint an employee representative to the board. Google is not meeting either of those demands. The company\u2019s chief diversity officer, Danielle Brown, will not report to Sundar Pichai as requested by organizers\u2019, according to the Los Angeles Times. There was also no mention of adding an employee representative to the board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.
