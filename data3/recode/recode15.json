{"id": "We have to rewrite antitrust law to deal with tech monopolies, says \u2018Positive Populism\u2019 author Steve Hilton", "paragraph": "To effectively regulate the tech sector, we first have to unlearn a lot of things we take for granted, says \u201cPositive Populism\u201d author Steve Hilton.\u201c[There\u2019s a] story we used to tell, a true story, about whether Facebook knocked out Myspace and Google knocked out Microsoft, and these tech companies don\u2019t stay powerful for too long,\u201d Hilton said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. \u201cIt feels like that\u2019s not really true anymore.\u201dOn top of that, he told Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher, not-very-old axioms about corporate regulation no longer apply. He cited the example of onetime Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, who argued that \u201cthe size of a company is only a problem\u201d if it prevents customers from getting \u201cdecent-quality products and services at a reasonable price.\u201dToday, multiple tech giants operate in parallel to one another, giving away high-quality products for nothing, which prevents most competitors from challenging their dominance.\u201cWhen I was learning economics at university, we had this notion of predatory pricing, which is when you price your product below marginal cost in order to shut out the competition, and that was seen as a problem,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cWell, now, predatory pricing is the business model, which is we give it away free.\u201dHe proposed a \u201csacrificial\u201d idea \u2014 meaning a theoretical change that probably wouldn\u2019t work, but points in the right direction \u2014 for reining these tech monopolies: Stop leaving antitrust rulings up to \u201cthe whim of an individual regulator or a judge.\u201d\u201cThe framework that I propose [in the book] is based on market power, market concentration, which is over a certain proportion of a market, you\u2019re deemed to be a monopoly and basically part of the public sector,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cYou have maximum pay rates for a senior executive, minimum pay for workers, tight regulation on how you behave ... And let\u2019s say you\u2019re under 10 percent of the market, then you\u2019re totally competitive, and maybe there\u2019s an incentive to do that, where you have no regulation or whatever.\u201dYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast.Below, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Steve.Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is Steve Hilton, the co-founder and former CEO of Crowdpac. He\u2019s been on the show before talking about that. But he\u2019s also the host of a show on Fox News called \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d and the author of a new book. Steve, welcome to Recode Decode.Steve Hilton: Great to be back.I\u2019m gonna let you say the title of this book because it makes me laugh.What\u2019s wrong with it? Do you promise to burst out laughing like they did at the UN when President Trump ...Yes.Okay, perfect.That was the appropriate response.Okay. The new book is called \u201cPositive Populism.\u201d Yes, I know. That makes me laugh.\u201cRevolutionary ideas to rebuild economic security, family and community in America.\u201d\u201cPositive Populism.\u201d All right, before we get to it, let\u2019s explain ... you\u2019re a British political hack, essentially. Thank you very much.You worked for several different people and ...But you forgot to mention my restaurant that I started and ran, my corporate socialist responsibility consulting firm.I don\u2019t care about that. We talked about that before. What I care about ... so anyway, so since we talked ...Also the Hungarian part. I always wanna get that in.Right, since we talked, you were running Crowdpac. Explain Crowdpac for the people.So Crowdpac is a crowdfunding site for politics. The idea behind it was to make it easier for candidates \u2014 independent candidates and independent-minded candidates of all parties and none \u2014 to run for office without relying on the traditional big donors and the party machines, so that when they get elected, they wouldn\u2019t be dependent on anyone other than their constituents. Like an Indiewire for ...Well, yeah, and just to sort of enable small donors. Small donors obviously haven\u2019t had the greatest success. Obama had great success with small donors, Bernie Sanders, that\u2019s great for those big presidential campaigns. The idea was to bring that energy and dynamism of the small donor movement to every race, not just federal but state and local as well. Andy Flora, he did that, Andrew Gilham did that. A lot of people. Different candidates have different success with that. Exactly. So we were a platform to enable that. We started out very strongly of the view that we ought to be a nonpartisan platform. That was our position, and when we last spoke, that\u2019s what Crowdpac was. Right at the beginning, actually, everyone said to me, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s not how politics works in America. You\u2019re gonna have to pick a side. You won\u2019t be able to make the nonpartisan thing work because there\u2019ll be suspicion of you on both sides.\u201d And that basically turned out to be true. So I\u2019m pleased to say that Crowdpac has done really well in this cycle, particularly. But as you could predict, the energy, in terms of small donors and people running for office and the kind of independent-minded person running for office \u2014 the person who\u2019s not a political hack, who hasn\u2019t done it before \u2014 that\u2019s basically all been on the left.And so we looked at the data and basically followed the user and it turned out that, I think the last time I saw the numbers, when I basically stepped down as CEO earlier in the year, I think it was 87 percent of the candidates on Crowdpac were Democrats. So you were running a Democratic organization.Right, and like 94 percent of the dollars raised were on the left. And so it was just increasingly untenable for me to be heading up that organization.Right, because you\u2019re not increasingly on the left.Exactly. And so we made a strategic decision ...Untenable? Did they just say, get this ...No, actually, I initiated the process because it was clear that actually the Crowdpac\u2019s success was being held back by the fact that the CEO, me, was identified as being on the right. And I think that the ... so I initiated a process, we talked to senior management and the board and said, \u201cI think it makes sense for us to ...\u201dWhere does something like that go? Just create partisan fundraising organization? What happens?Well that\u2019s what Crowdpac now is. So we took a strategic decision to officially become a progressive, left-leaning organization and actually removed the small number of Republican candidates from the platform.How many were there? Like two?I don\u2019t know, a handful.Were they sort of lefty Republicans?No, I would say they were slightly more of the sort of crazy side of Republicans, those ... I know you might challenge that term as applying only to a small group.No, I do challenge that, right, these days. Everyone has a chance to go crazy for a while. So you left that, how do you look at it as a success? Because you also wanted to be an information vehicle ...Yeah that was an initial ... I think we ... typical tech mistake, frankly, looking back on it. But you learn from them. I think we wanted to do too many things, we didn\u2019t have sufficient focus. So originally, the initial idea, the very first idea that I pitched to investors when I was doing the rounds was this very focused crowdfunding platform. I literally, my stupid elevator pitch line was, \u201cKickstarter for politics.\u201d That was the phrase that I used. Very much focused on the crowdfunding. And then as time went on and I met my co-founder, Adam Bonica, who\u2019s very impressive, professor at Stanford of political science who\u2019s really done a lot of brilliant work on data and analyzing campaign finance data and what that can tell you about candidates. And so we built out this whole data model and we thought, well that\u2019s really great, because we won\u2019t just enable people to give money and candidates to raise money, we can also provide objective information about elections. So we become a broader platform and this is what ... We used this phrase, \u201cplatform for political participation\u201d \u2014 raising money, running for office and voting.And giving out information.And giving out information. So we spent a lot of time building out voter guides and profiles of candidates and races and so on. And in the end, A) that was a distraction, frankly, for our team from the core work that we initially, that was my initial plan, and in the end was the thing that really took off. And secondly, it was just from a business point of view not obvious how we would monetize that ...No, how would you? \u201cThanks a lot for the work you\u2019re doing.\u201d... in a way that wouldn\u2019t compromise the integrity of the information and make people suspicious of it. And so in the end we decided to drop all of that and it was exactly when we made that focus that things really started to take off.And it\u2019s still raising money.Yeah, absolutely.And who\u2019s running it? Who\u2019s the CEO?My co-founder Gisel Kordestani.Is running it. So what\u2019s your affiliation with it now?Well I\u2019m literally a ... I\u2019m not on the board, I came off the board and I\u2019m not in the management and I just don\u2019t have any contact with them.Because then you went over to Fox and have this new show.Well, we did it in parallel. The show\u2019s now about a year old.Right, exactly. But, what do you mean? I wanna get to your book in the next section, but the increasing politicization of things. Talk about that, because you\u2019re leaving a job because of that. Did people complain?There was a bit of that. But it wasn\u2019t just that. It was also things like ... actually, funny enough, even the designation \u201cnonpartisan\u201d was a barrier.It sounds so much better in British. Nonpartisan.Yeah, okay. Maybe that was the problem. Sounds like a cheese.Everyone should have said it with a British accent. We conducted our whole lives in a British accent.One of the things we were trying to do is to build partnerships with organizing groups, people who were helping candidates run for office and so on, and present our tools.And there\u2019s lots of them.Exactly. And some of them, we established very good relationships within. A good example I think is Sister District, for example, working partnership even when I was there. But there are others who just said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, we just don\u2019t wanna work with a nonpartisan platform. We are Democrats and we wanna work in an ecosystem that\u2019s entirely Democrat.\u201dDemocrat.And so that was happening anyway. Because they wanna target those voters.And then my increasing prominence, I was on TV and whatever. And I\u2019d always been openly a \u201cconservative,\u201d if you like, although actually I don\u2019t really like that label either. So we\u2019ll get to \u201cPositive Populism\u201d in minute. But it was never a secret.Just walk around like a conservative.That\u2019s right.I\u2019ve heard you can\u2019t do that in Silicon Valley.It\u2019s very dangerous.No, it\u2019s not.I\u2019m joking.Good God.I\u2019m joking.I know.And the thing is, it wasn\u2019t as if Crowdpac was getting a compensating increase in traction amongst Republicans because I was increasingly well-known. That wasn\u2019t happening either. So we weren\u2019t getting any benefit. From your being ...From me being on TV, as it were, and identified on the Republican side. But it was holding us back. So what is the point of this? It makes more sense to just ...Be more progressive.And also just to ...Go where your customers are.Exactly right. To catch up with the reality. And then once you make that decision \u2014 that we\u2019re officially a left-leaning platform \u2014 it just makes no sense for me to be running that. Right. And so you leave and you started this show on Fox News called \u201cThe Next Revolution.\u201d Explain that also for people, because I want them to get a context.So Sunday nights at 9 Eastern we do it live. We do it live! As someone once said.I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve been on your show. Usually from LA, although once a month from New York or D.C. And it\u2019s an opinion show. It does have a theme which comes really from my prejudices, I guess, which is ... I say every week, \u201cThis is the home of Positive Populism.\u201d The book title came from what I say every Sunday. And so what I\u2019m trying to do on the show is make an argument for exactly that. For a populist policy agenda that isn\u2019t all about being angry and yelling and screaming and complaining about things. Rather it\u2019s about saying, \u201cOkay, how do we solve the problems that have given rise to populist phenomena like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Brexit or whatever?\u201dSo that\u2019s the idea, and we do it every Sunday. And one of the things that\u2019s really distinctive about it that we did on the very first show and has really taken off is this segment we do every week called Swamp Watch, which I love, and it has had a great response, where we actually dive into the anatomy of this phrase everyone now uses, \u201cthe swamp\u201d, we\u2019re sitting in it now in D.C. as we\u2019re talking. And the connections between big money and the corporate interests and the donations and the lobbying and the revolving door between Congress and the private sector and the way that all ends up influencing policy. And we do a lot of good work, I think, exposing that. And, by the way, we do it in a very independent-minded way. So I\u2019ve gone after Wilbur Ross and Scott Pruitt and Steve Mnuchin and Ted Cruz, most recently.Oh, that\u2019s easy. That\u2019s low-hanging fruit.Well, on the connections between, for example ...Pruitt\u2019s real low-hanging fruit. But I agree with you, you\u2019re right.The way you serve on a committee and you regulate, I don\u2019t know, the transportation industry, and then you get a ton of money from transportation interest.So you take those on. You\u2019ve taken on a lot of issues. You went after a whole bunch of things that I was surprised at. So being ...I don\u2019t wanna give the wrong impression, however, that\u2019s just to make sure our listeners understand that I do try to be independent. But on the other hand, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m sort of importing a bit of MSNBC into Fox, I don\u2019t wanna give people that impression.So you\u2019re not Rachel Maddow of Fox News. Well, a little bit.Well, I like to think that we go deeper into the kind of ... because my background is in policy and government. I like to think that we go a bit deeper into some of the issues and explain why this is happening.Instead of a screamfest, the regular screamfest on both \u2014 or bag of rage which is what I call Sean Hannity, but you don\u2019t have to call him that. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. My dear colleague and friend.In any case. But that\u2019s the show, that\u2019s the show, he\u2019s mad. And yours is more like, let\u2019s look at each of these policies. You have a little mad on the show. All of them have to.Exactly, I don\u2019t want to pretend it\u2019s something it\u2019s not, but I also would like ... I think one other dimension to it ...You have a much smarter show. It\u2019s the only reason I agreed to go on it.Thank you. I think that the other thing I would say is, there\u2019s something about your tone, one\u2019s tone. I try and do it at least with a smile on my face, literally but also figuratively in the sense of trying to be positive about all this craziness that\u2019s going on and trying to direct it towards solutions.But it\u2019s to generate ... I mean, the way it\u2019s \u2026 one, it\u2019s partially entertainment to do this, to create those panels of people screaming at each other. And it\u2019s cheap, by the way. It\u2019s a really inexpensive way to do it. And it\u2019s not smart or substantive or solution-based. They\u2019re all the same in that way because they\u2019re not trying to look for solutions, they\u2019re trying to ... \u201cAre we not entertained?\u201d It\u2019s like \u201cThe Gladiator.\u201dAnd I think taking on big topics, that used to be ... you would be more in the William Safire school, considered conservative opinions that are then expressed in an intelligent way.Yeah, and also the other thing I like doing is having people on who\u2019ve written interesting books, whether they\u2019re from the right or left or no particular political place, just looking at an issue. And occasionally topics that I feel strongly about that you just wouldn\u2019t expect to see on cable. An example was \u2014 it was actually my wife who first pointed it out to me but we were both really horrified \u2014 it was an amazing story by a New York Times reporter a couple of months ago on the trade in apes. And it was one of those brilliant pieces of reporting, put it on the front page and just lengthy reporting, and you just read every word. I read every word of it and thought, \u201cThis is so good and awful. But such a good report. Let\u2019s have him on to talk about it.\u201d It was interesting because, actually, the audience responded really well to that and you might have thought, well, that\u2019s not the sort of thing, and it\u2019s animal welfare and who cares about that? Turns out, a lot of people do.Of course. But they get a steady diet of anger. Again, on both sides it\u2019s a steady of ... exactly. Literally the other night my mom said something and I went and looked on Fox News and that\u2019s just what they had said and I was like, \u201cOh my God, she\u2019s been near the television.\u201d It was really interesting. She does that all the time. It\u2019s the ability to think on your own about issues is getting harder. So your show is much like that. So you do this weekly and then from this, was the idea of \u201cPositive Populism.\u201d So why don\u2019t you start going into that and we\u2019ll talk more about it in the next segment. How do you describe that? Give me a quick definition and we\u2019ll get to it. I think the reality is that that word, populism, I know it\u2019s been around for a long time but it\u2019s been kind of revived in the last few years and applied to these various political phenomenons.On many sides.Brexit, Trump, Bernie Sanders on the left as well, not just exclusively on the right. But I think if you ask people, \u201cWell, what is populism?\u201d I think to the extent that anyone has anything to say about it, they would say, well, it\u2019s against things, it\u2019s against the elites, it\u2019s against controlled immigration, it\u2019s against big business or trade deals or whatever. It\u2019s always what it\u2019s against.I think, as I argue in the book, there\u2019s a lot of good reasons for people to be angry with some of that. But what I wanted to do was say, \u201cOkay, fine, you\u2019re angry, but how are we gonna solve that?\u201d And there\u2019s a line I use that\u2019s a bit pat but I say, \u201cAnger without an agenda just leads to further rage and frustration and actually self pity.\u201dAnd so you\u2019ve gotta turn that anger into something constructive and that\u2019s really the point of \u201cPositive Populism\u201d is that, okay, what are we for? Not just what are we against. What is populism for? What\u2019s it in favor of? What\u2019s it arguing for?So how would you define populism? When we get back in the next section I want you to talk about more specifics of what you think.I would say there\u2019s four things. And I\u2019m gonna say them and you\u2019re gonna say, \u201cWell that\u2019s a platitude.\u201d And I\u2019m gonna explain why it\u2019s not. So the first thing is that I think it\u2019s not particularity ideological, that\u2019s why I\u2019m now uncomfortable with labels like \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cright\u201d or ... it just doesn\u2019t feel right to me. It\u2019s not ideological, it\u2019s very practical and pragmatic and it\u2019s defined, in my view, not by ideology but by interests. What are the interests it\u2019s trying to advance? And to me there are three in particular. It\u2019s pro-worker, pro-family and pro-community. And you said, \u201cWell, who\u2019s against that?\u201d Well, if you look at the way policy\u2019s been constructed and implemented over the last few decades, not just the last ... it\u2019s not a partisan thing against Obama or whatever. Under Obama, Bush, all of them, policy has not been pro-worker, it\u2019s actually been in favor of the owners of capital and so on. It hasn\u2019t been pro-family. By the way, when I say pro-family I don\u2019t want people to hear that as some kind of ...Straight people. Straight, white people having children.No, I say very clearly in the sections on family, I totally ... and when I worked in the British government, we introduced marriage equality and I\u2019ve always been for it and there\u2019s an interesting argument about the way, at the same time, I\u2019m digressing now but at the same time as marriage equality has advanced, and that\u2019s a great thing, marriage has retreated in the straight world. And that\u2019s kind of an interesting thing.Only gay people wanna get married and go into the military. But go ahead.But actually there\u2019s an interesting twist to that which is also, marriage has become a class thing. So the way I put it in the book is, now marriage is for gay people and rich people. Yeah, there was just an interesting article in the Times about this. So I think that various things, not just policy, have actually helped undermine families of all kinds. And when I say pro-community, what that really means is trying to restore a sense of ... I think everything\u2019s become too centralized. Power\u2019s become too concentrated, both in the economy and in government, and so dispersing power ...Back to the locals.Exactly, is a really big theme of this. And I think that would give more people a sense of control over what goes on around them and that would make them less angry.Right, and more sense of belonging. All right, we\u2019re here talking to Steve Hilton. He\u2019s the host of \u201cNext Revolution\u201d on Fox News. He\u2019s also the author of a new book called \u201cPopular Populism.\u201d He\u2019s explaining that. When we get back we\u2019re gonna talk about what that means in practice because something\u2019s gotta give here in this country and across the world.We\u2019re here with Steve Hilton, he\u2019s the host of \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d on Fox News but he\u2019s also the author of a book called \u201cPopular Populism.\u201d He used to run a company in Silicon Valley called Crowdpac which is trying to do, especially, Kickstarter for funding of elections and information. He left that and now he\u2019s focused on his show and also on this book. So let\u2019s talk more about \u201cPopular Populism.\u201d Positive.Positive, sorry, not Popular. Popular populism, that\u2019s funny. \u201cPositive Populism,\u201d they\u2019re never paired together. So why is that? Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happened. Because I think Donald Trump has ridden the wave of angry populism. You aren\u2019t getting enough, you got screwed, the elite\u2019s got you, the whole, you know ...And not just him, let\u2019s be fair, Bernie as well. Yes, the same thing. Yeah.And actually, the language was very similar. That was one of the interesting things, I think, during the 2016 campaign, 2015/2016, those two years where they were making their arguments, is there\u2019s such huge overlap between the things that they said, Bernie and Trump. I remember Trump talked constantly about the other candidates, Bush and so on, as well as Hillary, the phrase used there, \u201cthe puppets of their donors.\u201d He talked a lot, actually. Okay, you can say he hasn\u2019t done anything about it subsequently, but in the campaign he talked a lot about the way that big money was controlling politics, exactly like Bernie did. There was a real alignment with them around trade and the way they talked about that. Even immigration. Bernie had to sort of close that down to get anywhere, but there\u2019s quite an amazing interview in 2015 Bernie gave where he said, \u201cOpen borders, that\u2019s a Koch brothers\u2019 proposal. What are we going to do? Bring in all these low-wage workers? That\u2019s going to hurt African-American kids,\u201d and whatever. Very similar arguments. I think that that is exactly ... you\u2019re right, that it was always what we\u2019re against, and I think that that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s like, well, what are we going to do about it?What else? List the other things they\u2019re against, they\u2019re against ... it\u2019s fear, it\u2019s based in fear, it\u2019s based in you\u2019re losing out, it\u2019s based in you\u2019re getting less.You\u2019re getting screwed by the ...You\u2019re getting screwed, and the other guy\u2019s doing it.Yes, that\u2019s right. And that\u2019s historical. Well, maybe not, because I\u2019m listening to the Andrew Jackson book, which is very complex, actually. Much more so than has been written about. He\u2019s not Trump at all, he has some terrible things he did and also a really interesting politician. But it\u2019s throughout U.S. history and throughout history in general, you could say the French Revolution is populism. How do you look at it over time?Yeah, and the American [Revolution], actually. I think that\u2019s right. Especially its focus on, again, it sounds a bit of a clich\u00e9, but that theme of people power, putting power in the hands of people, is a ...Which is also called mob rule, too. I mean, that\u2019s what it\u2019s been called sometimes. Well, as long as it\u2019s been dispersed, we can get into that. But I wanted to mention the historical underpinnings at least. Funnily enough, I\u2019m not a historian, I remember when this word came up in the last couple of years, I embraced it. If we get to go back, I worked as you mentioned earlier, in politics in the U.K., my first job out of college was working at the Conservative Party headquarters in the U.K., where Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. So for various reasons, my parents are Hungarian and I know that there\u2019s no connection directly between communism and Hungary and the Labor Party in the U.K., but I found myself on the right in identifying with Thatcher. Partly because she had a story in the \u201980s that she was for the workers. By the way, that was quite interesting, she sort of changed from that. So I\u2019ve always been on that side of the political fence but increasingly felt that it didn\u2019t really feel comfortable. For example, when I rose through the ranks and went and did other things, started businesses and came back, when my friend David Cameron went to become the leader and I worked with him on a policy agenda that a lot of people said, \u201cThat\u2019s not conservative,\u201d and we were accused of betraying the principles, all that stuff. And I felt \u201cyeah, actually\u201d \u2014 we didn\u2019t say it, but I just felt this label doesn\u2019t really, I think it\u2019s too ideological, it doesn\u2019t fit me. Right. So when the \u201cpopulist\u201d word started being bandied around, 2015, 2016, I thought, actually I like that. I didn\u2019t really know anything about its historical precedent, so I\u2019m not really best placed to comment on that. But I think from what I\u2019ve read and seen and heard, that is right. It\u2019s always been this resentment-driven ...Off with their heads. Yeah. This resentment-driven approach. Is that what it\u2019s like in Trump populism now? Because that\u2019s what ... It\u2019s fear-based almost, it\u2019s not positive. I think we\u2019ve just got to move beyond that. Come on, Steve. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ve got to actually solve the problem. No. I think people can remain bomb throwers. When you\u2019re campaigning, you know that you\u2019re a campaigner, and then you have to govern. Yes. But people are very comfortable in campaign mode, especially this president, is very much happy to stay there. Yeah, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m in the guess ...I\u2019m saying, populism now is seen as Trump populism. At least in this country. And the same thing in other countries. Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s really one of the reasons I wanted to write the book, because there\u2019s very little... I mean, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ll necessarily be pleased to hear this or not, but there\u2019s very little of Donald Trump anywhere in the book, because it\u2019s not about that. My argument is, long after he\u2019s gone, whether it\u2019s another two years \u2014 or, to horrify you, another six years \u2014 long after he\u2019s gone, we\u2019re still going to have these problems, because they\u2019re deep structural problems. All through the way we run the economy and society and services like education and training, the future, all the stuff we often talk about. Those are really deep, long-term problems and we\u2019re gonna have to have some answers to them. Long after he\u2019s gone, whoever comes next, Democrat, Republican, whatever. So what I really wanted to contribute to is the start of a conversation about an intellectually coherent set of ideas that would advance the interests of the people who have been left out. Is the word now \u2014 and words matter \u2014 is the word now sullied in that way, because that\u2019s how people think of it?Oh, for sure. I would absolutely acknowledge that. I say that. Because it links with nationalism, it links with ...I would say you\u2019re right, words matter. I would say, I think racism is one thing that\u2019s obviously not okay and needs to be strongly condemned. Again, I\u2019ve do that very clearly on the show, I\u2019ve tried to distinguish between racism and xenophobia. But nationalism ...But I\u2019m saying, how do you reclaim that word?Well, by this, by talking about it. But most importantly, I think, what I really care about is putting these ideas out there, regardless of whether, and these arguments out there, whether or not these exact ideas and policies get implemented is not the point, than to start a conversation, but really to build a movement of people, actually in all parties. I don\u2019t think this needs to be a right or left thing who think about this and say, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, I can advance the interest of workers in our policy conversations, and families, and believe in decentralizing power,\u201d and that all adds up to a populist message and a populist approach, whether that\u2019s through the Democrats or Republicans or Independents or whatever. It\u2019s a long-term thing. All right. So let\u2019s go through the ones you\u2019re talking about. So what would be the policies to help workers?One of the most basic things you see is this incredible economic insecurity and anxiety that comes from not being able to live on what you earn and not having a reliable income. And there\u2019s so many different measures you can look at that through. One that I think is particularly striking shows how long the problem\u2019s been going on, if you look at the 80 percent or so of, I think the term is \u201cnonmanagerial and nonsupervisory workers.\u201d I think that 80/20 thing, I know it\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it works in this setting, where I talk about the elites and so on. And of course I\u2019m one of them. Yes, you are. You\u2019re more elite than I am. Do you know that?Of course. And I totally acknowledge that. There\u2019s a difference between the elites and elitism, which is a set of policies that help the elite. Right. So you\u2019re like a nice elite.I\u2019m a traitor to my elite class because I\u2019m trying to help the workers, I guess. Anyway, the thing is that I think it\u2019s not the 1 percent, that\u2019s the point I was going to make, that we always hear about. It\u2019s more like the top 20 percent.There\u2019s a brilliant, brilliant piece in the Atlantic, cover story a couple months ago, that the author talked about the 9.9 percent, not the 99, as being the real ... and this notion of the inherited meritocracy. People who\u2019ve got there on their own merits and have risen through the ranks of education and hard work and now have captured those benefits, and people are left behind.So this data point I was going to give you, 80 percent or so are nonsupervisor, nonmanagerial workers. If you take inflation into account, their incomes have been flat since 1972. This is not just the last, the great recession. It\u2019s amazing. There\u2019s been this huge disconnect that used to be there between economic growth, productivity and the economy, and incomes, where they all went up together, roughly. And around the early \u201970s, that relationship just broke. Right. And suddenly the workers\u2019 pay was flat, but the economy still grew. Whatever. And there\u2019s lots of other measures too, and they\u2019re changing the labor market.So the policies for that one. Well, the No. 1 thing, I think, is to assert a principle, which is, if you work full-time, you should be able to live on what you earn. At the moment, there are tens of millions, probably more, I haven\u2019t looked at the exact data, who do work full-time and can\u2019t live on what they earn. Right. So earned income tax credit, they say. Because they get all these subsidies of various kinds from the government, tax credits and food stamps and so on. And of course those things are vital, because you couldn\u2019t live without them. But my argument is, you should get that from your employer, not from the government or another source.Yeah, that\u2019s a hard sell, Steve. Okay. So my idea in the book is what I call the business-friendly living wage. It\u2019s really interesting, actually, it may highlight an area for compromise. Ro Khanna from Silicon Valley, where I\u2019m based, and Bernie, just introduced a bill the other week I think it was called the Stop BEZOS Act, and the Bezos thing was some kind of acronym. And they made the point, which I 100 percent agree with, which is, this phenomenon is basically a subsidy to corporate America. So they pay their workers too little for them to live on, and the government tops off their pay. So they can get away with low wages. But at the same time, there\u2019s another bit of the equation, which is the government takes money from the companies in the form of taxation, corporate taxes and payroll taxes.So my argument is, let\u2019s raise the minimum wage to the level of the living wage, which varies from place to place depending on housing costs and transportation costs. But make sure that you can live on what you earn, you really can. Right?That\u2019s going to be very high in some places, way higher than the minimum wage. But at the same time, let\u2019s cut their corporate and payroll taxes, or both, or some combination, so that the net impact on the bottom line is neutral, so that what they don\u2019t do, which is also counterproductive, is have to lay off workers because they\u2019re more expensive, or replace them with automation. Right. Now, the Stop BEZOS Bill, the Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna thing, addresses the exact same problem but through what I would say is a worse solution, which is to take the amount of the subsidy and tax them more, so that\u2019s just increasing the tax, which I don\u2019t think is a particularly helpful thing. Right. But it shows that there\u2019s a lot of shared ground. But doing minimum wage is so controversial, it\u2019s the same thing. They consider it taxing, that\u2019s the same. Yeah, but someone\u2019s got to pay. Of course, then there are other things, like why is housing so expensive in the first place? And there\u2019s a lot of argument there. I was on Bill Maher last week and I made the point that zoning regulations are a huge factor in housing being so expensive, which is true, because there\u2019s not enough being built. And one of the reasons there\u2019s not enough being built is because zoning regulations favor the people who already have property rather than those [who need it], exactly. Look, there\u2019s lots of things we can do also to reduce the cost of living as well, but I think there\u2019s a basic dignity point, which is if you work full-time \u2014 and by the way, a lot more people still do. I know we all talk about the gig economy and so on, and there\u2019s a lot we could do there to make that fairer ...Yes, of course. That\u2019s something Gavin Newsom\u2019s been pushing, the idea that we change the way economic incentives ...But still, most people do still work in full-time regular jobs, actually. It\u2019s not just all disappeared in favor of ...But it\u2019s obviously changing, though. Yeah. But not as rapid ... Anyway, look. There\u2019s a basic dignity point and a moral point there. It creates broken societies when people feel on the edge. Exactly. And then there are other things that you could do. For example, again, this is not particularly new thinking, but perhaps new from someone on Fox News, is that there are multiple ways in which the owners of businesses treat workers unfairly.A great example is noncompetes, which are actually outlawed in California, generally, and one of the reasons I think you\u2019ve got such a dynamic tech sector. You can just quickly go to a competitor and whatever. But I think it\u2019s something like 18 percent of American workers are now covered by noncompete agreements, which is insane. These are supposed to be for genius scientists who\u2019ve got incredible ... That being applied to people who work in fast-food restaurants to stop them getting a modest pay raise by leaving McDonalds and going to Burger King, it\u2019s completely ridiculous. So there\u2019s lots of smaller steps, as well, that you can take that add up to a pro-worker policy agenda. And I think everyone should be in favor of that. You sound a little communist-y, I like it. I like this. Oh my god. Now I\u2019m really in trouble. We\u2019re here with Steve Hilton. We\u2019re talking about his new book, \u201cPositive Populism.\u201d Populism is now sort of a dirty word with a lot of people now, and it feels scary. Populism now feels awfully scary. Very mob rule, nationalistic, racist, all these things that are being linked with it, largely due to Donald Trump\u2019s pushing it. In other parts of the world \u2014 we always forget other parts of the world \u2014 where it\u2019s surging, it\u2019s a lot to do around immigration and issues around that too. So you were just talking about how to help the worker. The second one is how to help the families. I think most people agree that this country is anti-friendly to families, actually. There\u2019s no policies about maternity leave, except, say, in Silicon Valley, which has very strong ones, actually. Or California. Some people think those are onerous. What are their family policies? I would assume better maternity leave. Definitely, all of that. But I won\u2019t focus on those, because you can basically assume I agree with all of those. Right. And introduced many of them as part of the British government where I worked, or they were already there in the U.K. I want to talk about some new things. One of the things, and just to take a step back from it, I think one of the problems in this area has been that the right, for years and years, has gone and on about family values, all the time. Yes. But first of all, that hasn\u2019t extended to everyone, so it\u2019s excluded \u201cnontraditional\u201d families, as it were.Yes. We noticed. So I\u2019m against that. But the other practical thing is that they\u2019ve not been prepared to accept or even look at any kind of active help for families. It\u2019s all lectures and preaching about \u201cfamilies are good\u201d and \u201cwe love families.\u201d But when it comes to actually helping, \u201cno, that\u2019s nanny state, big government.\u201d So that\u2019s been a problem. But equally on the left, I think you\u2019ve had a problem with a rhetoric about supporting working families with practical measures, that\u2019s great. But also a reluctance to engage in some really pretty obvious science now about the importance of family stability and so on. And I think the answer to both is in the end not ideological, but practical. I\u2019ll give you an example, which is if you look at the data on when families break up, whether they\u2019re married or not, if you just look at the peak time period when typically a family that\u2019s together, when one partner leaves, it\u2019s not universal, but the peak time is within the first year of the first child being born. And it\u2019s pretty obvious why that would be. Yeah, it\u2019s a tough time. You know that. It\u2019s incredibly tough, it\u2019s stressful, you don\u2019t get any sleep, you argue, etc. So there\u2019s so much evidence now that practical help through that incredibly difficult period can help keep families together and kids growing up in a more stable home and on the right track. And there\u2019s two things I point to that are practical examples. First of all, in the U.K. there\u2019s a ... Well, I\u2019ll just start with here, in Colorado. It started in Colorado in the \u201970s, something called the nurse-family partnership, which is one of the best-evaluated social policy interventions in history, in the sense that the number of times it\u2019s been evaluated and is shown to be successful. But it\u2019s limited to at-risk populations. And the way it works is a trained nurse visits your home. They do ... In Louisiana, there\u2019s a whole bunch of them. Right. And they just help with practical things, literally. Like getting ready for the birth and then after the birth, literally how do I get the baby to sleep? Or feeding. All these things, just all the basic questions that is assumed that people know the answers to, because there\u2019s millions of books and videos and online things. But it\u2019s not the same as someone who really knows what they\u2019re doing that you trust, coming to your house. Positive government intervention. Right. And they, at the moment, that is very patchy and underfunded. So my proposal ...And it\u2019s not available for everybody. No. And it\u2019s explicitly designed right now as an intervention.Which makes sense, that\u2019s the most ...Sure, but my proposal is, I call it universal home visiting. I think it should be available. You don\u2019t want to force it on people if they really don\u2019t want it. But I can\u2019t imagine a family that wouldn\u2019t benefit from that. The most literate and well-educated and well-informed family, they can\u2019t do it either. And Kate Boo wrote an amazing piece, if you ever want to read it, about \u201cswamp nurses,\u201d it\u2019s a program in Louisiana, it\u2019s astonishing. It\u2019s a sad story because it\u2019s almost impossible to pull some of these people out of abject poverty and ignorance, the lack of education they\u2019re in. And it\u2019s wonderful. But you sat there and you were hoping so hard that it works, it made sense. It\u2019s sensible. The other thing I\u2019d say is that certainly \u2014 and I spent a lot of time on this in the U.K., there\u2019s a program in the UK called health visitors, which started I think in the Victorian era. And I wanted to greatly expand. The thing that is interesting is, the immediate reason for doing it is help with a new baby. And mothers are desperate for help, so it\u2019s a good moment to establish that trusting relationship with a professional. Yeah. So you feel like you\u2019re getting a benefit. But actually, what really is great is, over time, the visits can get less frequent and so on, from every other day to once a week to once a month and so on. But actually, they become trusted to help with other things and these other social issues that are going on. Maybe your partner\u2019s drinking too much, or there\u2019s a drug addiction incipient problem, or the health isn\u2019t that great in the family, or just mental illnesses. And what they can do is connect them to local resources that can help. And say, you know what? In a gentle way, not in a nanny way. Because they would know them. They know them. And of course part of the program would be training the visitors, as it were, in terms of what resources are available. There\u2019s a whole community aspect to that. None of this has to be the government. It\u2019ll need to be funded by the government throughout because otherwise it\u2019s not going to happen. You\u2019re not going to make this universal by relying on charity. And then the last one, community, and I want to sort of approach this in a way because most people feel that communities are breaking apart, local communities. Especially, oddly, Tom Friedman, this is a big thing of Tom Friedman\u2019s in his last book.  The idea that we move things, we push things down to the communities. Which I think has been sort of mutated by ultra-conservatives about all states rights, which has been an issue in this country from the beginning of the ... from the very beginnings of time. When actually, local is a great idea, it\u2019s just not... it\u2019s done in a way where it feels ignorant or it feels not that the ...Local doesn\u2019t mean state. I think that there\u2019s a really ...No, smaller than that. I try and sort of take ... way smaller. And so I roam through the pathway of decentralization, as it were. Yes, it\u2019s true that we should decentralize some things from the federal level to the state level, yes, but don\u2019t stop there.Give me an example. Well, healthcare for example is a good example. But way further than that, from the state ... you\u2019ve got California, fifth biggest economy in the world. If you\u2019ve got all the power in Sacramento, that is hardly localization. So from the states to cities and counties ... but the area I\u2019m really interested in and I think is probably the freshest area in the book, is the neighborhood. I think the neighbourhood is potentially an interesting area because you\u2019ve got potential human connections because you can actually see and feel and meet ... feel, probably shouldn\u2019t use that word ... You can meet people and you can look in their eyes.It\u2019s a minefield out there now!I know, I know. But the thing is that that\u2019s not going to happen just like that because you tell people, \u201cOh, you should get together and do things.\u201d People are busy, you\u2019ve got to give practical reasons for doing it, and a benefit. So one starting point is there\u2019s a ... it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 now and there\u2019s lots of ... it\u2019s been written about a lot and replicated a lot, but years ago, one of my great friends from university, she moved here, Merida, with a guy from New York and they\u2019d been living in Brooklyn for a long time and there\u2019s a place called the Park Slope Food Co-op that they took me to, which is very well-known. And the lovely thing about it is that it\u2019s a true cooperative in the sense that you can only shop there if you are a member and you have to work. Yeah, there\u2019s one in San Francisco. And just two or three quarter-hours a week or whatever. And there\u2019s a connection there. And what it really has made, that place is a community center because there\u2019s a reason for going. Yes, you got to go do your work but you get benefits, low prices, whatever. So my question was, can we try and apply that thinking to other local services? There\u2019s a concept called civic service, where let\u2019s try and think of \u2014 and this is one idea \u2014 but let\u2019s try and think of local services, it could be the local library or whatever, that could benefit from that kind of engagement. Where everybody\u2019s part of it rather than being served. Exactly. Another one is this notion of, I call it compulsory community tendering, where you require ... this could be a more forceful way of doing it where you could require local government to take services that are operated in the local area either by some distant corporation or whatever, and say we have to give the local neighbourhood the chance to run this. Now they may not want to, but maybe they do. Such as a...?Well, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it could be a health center or a clinic, I mean, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s all sorts of options people will ... a playground, the park ...Well, you know, a ...You\u2019ve got to give people reasons to get together locally and a benefit from doing it. Well, the breakdown of local communities, I think, is at the heart of so much of ...The other thing I would say about all of the ideas in the book, some of which ... I mean, I talked for a while at Stanford, and the most transformative part of that was teaching at the d.school, the design school, which is really about teaching the methodology of innovation that many of the technology firms follow, in terms of real focus on users and rapid prototyping and testing. And one of the concepts that we used at the d.school that I think is a great way of capturing the status, if you like, of some of the ideas of my book is we have this notion of a sacrificial prototype, which is, \u201cI know this is a stupid idea, I know it doesn\u2019t work, whatever, but I\u2019m going to put it out there, just to get the conversation going.\u201d It\u2019s better than just talking about something conceptually. Let\u2019s give a tangible prototype, at least an idea that is something defined and you can rip it apart and say, \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t work, and that won\u2019t work, but how about this?\u201dAnd not all of the ideas in my book, but some of them are of that nature, where I\u2019m really not ...Right, you\u2019re just going to start the conversation. Exactly. I\u2019m really not attached, or saying, \u201cYou have to implement this exactly as I\u2019ve written it down.\u201d They\u2019re ideas, they\u2019re not policies. They\u2019re there to start a conversation. So one of the things that people have, and let\u2019s talk a little bit about the tech industry, we only have a few more minutes, is this idea that tech and social media has brought down this concept where people are isolated, lonely, engaged in their phones. And it\u2019s true. It is true. How, with the techlash, and perhaps \u2014 I\u2019m going to preface it, your wife has worked for every tech company in America right now, Rachel Whetstone \u2014 but separate from that, how do you look at what\u2019s happening with those, and where do you see ... is it part of the policy, to regulate some of this? Or do you ...Oh, yeah. But if it\u2019s with another part of the argument on populism, which is the concentration of power in the economy and the way businesses have got too big, not just in tech but in every sector, and they\u2019ve been allowed to swallow up competition and stop entrepreneurs, or make it much, much harder for entrepreneurs to challenge them and knock them off their perch. And that story we used to tell, a true story, about whether Facebook knocked out Myspace and Google knocked out Microsoft, and these tech companies don\u2019t stay powerful for too long. It feels like that\u2019s not really true anymore, that story. No, I think it\u2019s a couple ... there used to be just one. I mean, was it IBM or was it AT&T or was it Microsoft, and now there\u2019s four or three and they\u2019re rolling down the highway like semi trucks. And nobody can get around them. And they\u2019re not particularly monopolies, but they kind of are. Because they don\u2019t really compete with each other, they\u2019re not ... really I think they squelch innovation, as a group. I agree. I would say Facebook, Google and Amazon. And there\u2019s an interesting ... Generally, my argument is we\u2019ve got to really rethink our whole antitrust approach to be much more aggressive, where at the moment the whole approach is based on this notion that was really introduced by Robert Bork. I mean, he\u2019s best known for the Supreme Court \u2026\u201cBeing Borked.\u201d\u2026 that whole thing, but actually probably his greatest policy contribution is this notion of consumer welfare \u2014 that\u2019s the phrase \u2014 which is that concentration of economic power ... The size of a company is only a problem if it hurts consumer welfare. In other words, if they\u2019re not getting decent-quality products and services at a reasonable price. The problem is they\u2019re getting decent quality. Right! A great quality, and the services are amazing, and nevermind price, it\u2019s free!Now, when I was learning economics at university, we had this notion of predatory pricing, which is when you price your product below marginal cost in order to shut out the competition, and that was seen as a problem. Well, now, predatory pricing is the business model, which is we give it away free. Right, and because they know the right prices to hit. I was literally at dinner with the head of Walmart the other day, and he\u2019s like, \u201cGod, their pricing at Amazon is so hard to follow.\u201d You know what I mean? They were the low-price leaders, and of course they have to chase it really fast. So I think that we\u2019ve got to broaden the ...But you have a company like Amazon ... if you\u2019re talking about communities where nobody shops anymore, or you have Facebook, nobody goes to church anymore. Google, you find things ... I mean, it\u2019s all separate. Well, there\u2019s two questions. There\u2019s the ... well, the way that it\u2019s all united is we\u2019ve got to broaden it out. We\u2019re not just consumers, we\u2019re workers and we\u2019re family members and we\u2019re community members and we\u2019re citizens who vote in elections. We\u2019re not just consumers. So the idea that regulatory framework is just on, \u201cAre you getting good stuff at cheap prices?\u201d is so out of date. So what\u2019s going to happen there? What do you see? Well, what I\u2019m arguing for \u2014 and recently I had a constructive conversation with the former head of the FTC about it and I don\u2019t think this is outlandish at all, this direction of travel \u2014 is to broaden that definition. So it\u2019s not just ... and the specific proposal that I\u2019ve got in the book \u2014 again, this probably really is one of the sacrificial prototypes \u2014 is we\u2019ve got to move away from the regulation of antitrust on the basis of the whim of an individual regulator or a judge in a case and actually have some rules here. And the framework that I propose is based on market power, market concentration, which is over a certain proportion of a market, you\u2019re deemed to be a monopoly and basically part of the public sector. So you can\u2019t pay your ...You become a utility.Yes. And for example, you have maximum pay rates for a senior executive, minimum pay for workers. Tight regulation on how you behave. A little bit lower, between 10 and 40 percent or whatever. Yeah, that\u2019s never passing. One second. You\u2019re deemed to be dominant and you have slightly less regulation. And let\u2019s say you\u2019re under 10 percent of the market, then you\u2019re totally competitive, and maybe there\u2019s an incentive to do that, where you have no regulation or whatever. And of course, as I say, people will argue about what are the right levels and so on. And it sort of depends how you define it. If you define Amazon as a retailer, it\u2019s quite a small percentage. Online retailer, very big. Book retailer, it becomes total monopoly basically. So those things will be argued about.It\u2019s difficult. That\u2019s the whole thing. You can\u2019t pin anything on them as easily ...Yes, but I think let\u2019s just start the conversation and try and get a bit more granular about it. I think there is an issue, the issue is about tech addiction, as it were. I think that is less amenable to this kind of concentration of power argument. Because I think even if you had a thousand Facebooks all with incredibly addictive technology, you\u2019d still have that problem. So my solution to it is not to use a phone at all, and I\u2019ve not had a phone for six years. That\u2019s the extreme. But I think that the future, and you know this far better than I do, but as the devices are kind of disappearing and the tech is merging more into ... Your body.In a weird way that might make it better, I don\u2019t know.Right. Except if it\u2019s all pervasive.Yes, but it means you\u2019re not literally looking at a screen. I don\u2019t know. Also, I can\u2019t tell how seriously they\u2019re taking it, frankly. I think that ...Who, the tech companies or regulators? Well, the tech companies. I think it\u2019s interesting that in the last year or so, Mark Zuckerberg has started to talk thoughtfully about using this phrase \u201ctime well spent,\u201d which came from Tristan Harris, the design ethicist who is trying to help the companies do this better. That seems to me a serious engagement with the issue at least. They\u2019re not just blowing it off. I guess. I think it\u2019s bullshit. Okay, well, that\u2019s your view. I know it\u2019s bullshit. Well, I think that ... funnily enough, I did, in my past life, I ran this company Good Business in the U.K. And one of the ... we were a corporate responsibility consulting firm, we worked with big companies. And this issue came up a lot in other contexts, particularly utility. We had some utility companies who were being obliged by the government to promote energy efficiency.No, I think people are thinking ...So the question came up quite a lot. McDonald\u2019s was one of our clients, and it was like, how do you make a virtue of trying to get your consumers to use your product less? How do you actually make that ...Well, look at Patagonia. There\u2019s a bunch of companies. I would say that there are tech leaders ... I think Kevin Systrom is one of them. Very much so. We\u2019ve talked about this stuff a lot, he\u2019s the only one that ever would engage with me on these topics, years ago. Brian Chesky. There\u2019s a couple ... I would say Marc Benioff often, when he\u2019s not being Marc Benioff, is very much so. There\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s just a question of whether they see it as not just a duty, like take your medicine, and more as this is an ethos that is good for society.And also, what we tried to argue at Good Business, and I wrote a book called \u201cGood Business: Your World Needs You,\u201d is try and see your social contribution as core. So it\u2019s not so much an add-on or the guilt ...It\u2019s not No. 14. Can you think of a way to genuinely benefit commercially from helping to solve social problems rather than create them?Absolutely. And one of the things that I always say is either you do something about this ...But that requires real creativity. ... or you buy yourself a Mercedes that is weaponized. You\u2019re going to have to have walls and you\u2019re going to have to have ... you know what I mean? And then the real, the populism, we don\u2019t like so much. The ugly populism will be dangerous for these people. But it\u2019s interesting. For example, we talked earlier about the predatory pricing, giving it away free. Well, if you start charging ... I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to do the job for them, but I think they must be creative thinking about it, but you\u2019ve got to get commercial about it otherwise it will never be serious. You\u2019ve got to rethink the business model. Absolutely, 100 percent. All right, just finishing up, last thing. What will happen to Trump populism in the last election? Very quickly. Do you mean midterms or ...Yeah, midterms and going forward. It feels very much as if the backlash to Trump\u2019s election will be the dominant focus and particularly with the mobilization of women candidates and women voters in response to a combination of both sides of Trump\u2019s victory and Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat. But that feels like the story of this particular election.And does this ugly populism peter out, as it often does? No, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important. I\u2019m serious about trying to turn this into a movement so that we put something against that that\u2019s constructive and positive, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away. I think the problems are getting worse, precisely because there isn\u2019t a policy agenda to deal with the concentration of power. And you haven\u2019t talked about immigration and the mass migration around the world. This is a bigger issue, and conflicts around the world leading to displacement of people and refugees. It\u2019s just not easy. It\u2019s interesting, it does strike me, and then we have to finish, is sometimes when Trump says things he\u2019s directionally correct and has a lizard brain for the right thing, but always is focused on the wrong thing. Like with tech companies, with their \u201cconservative bias.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not, but there is a problem over there.\u201d But he\u2019s always identifying the exact wrong problem. Exactly the wrong problem. And over here they\u2019re doing the real damage, which is ... I think one thing I would say is that he\u2019s absolutely right about China. We haven\u2019t got time to properly get into that, but I do think that that\u2019s a real shift in policy from where you saw the consensus and the foreign policy establishment, which is like, if you suck up to China and engage with them and whatever, they\u2019re going to get better on human rights, they\u2019re going to become more of a market economy, they\u2019re going to ... it\u2019s absolutely, totally wrong. You know, I\u2019m on that side too. Right. But not the way he\u2019s doing it. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s not about plastic toys, it\u2019s ...\u201dCorrect. But you know, there are signs that the regime which looks so powerful and invulnerable even a year ago, there are signs of it wobbling a bit actually and saying, \u201cHang on a second.\u201dI think they\u2019re racing right past us. I think we\u2019re focusing on the plastic toys and they\u2019re busy innovating the future of AI and everything else. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to both impede them from doing that and support our own efforts. But why focus on the plastic toys? That\u2019s over. I think that he may be in the wrong but I don\u2019t think the policy generally ... I think there are smart people in there who actually get the broader picture. Yes, absolutely. All right, Steve, this is great. Your book is called \u201cPositive Populism.\u201d It\u2019s available now, on Amazon. Yeah, you would never know ... Okay, I\u2019ve got to say this. I paid for a site called positivepopulism.org.What was it, $25?Which also enables you to buy at Barnes and Noble and independent retailers and so on. Good, good. Well, you should read it. Steve\u2019s a really thoughtful person in Silicon Valley and it\u2019s always nice to have him in and talk about these issues, because they\u2019re very important ones going forward for the whole country. And we do have to move in a positive way and you do sound a little leftie now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, you\u2019ve been hanging out in Palo Alto too long. No, it\u2019s Fox News, it\u2019s turned me left. Yeah, all right. The left wing of Fox. Here we are.I\u2019m joking. I don\u2019t like it, I think the left-right thing ...I hate it, everyone hates it.I don\u2019t buy it at all. They\u2019re exhausting, but they\u2019re more exhausting on the right, right now. But they\u2019re exhausting on all sides. Anyway, it was great talking to you. Thanks for coming on the show.
