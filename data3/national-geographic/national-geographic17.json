The flow was previously a mystery, as the mean temperature is 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius) and little glacial melting can be seen at the surface.Imaging from underneath the glacier helped solve the mystery, revealing a complex network of subglacial rivers and a subglacial lake\u2014all filled with brine high in iron, giving the falls its reddish tint.According to the study, the makeup of the brine explains the fact that it flows instead of freezes.\u201cThe brine remains liquid within the subglacial and englacial environments through latent heat of freezing coupled with elevated salt content,\u201d the study explains.The lake under the glacier has an unusually salty consistency, and because saltwater has a lower freezing point than pure water and releases heat as it freezes, it melts the ice, enabling the rivers to flow.This means that the glacier can support flowing water and also that this is the coldest glacier on Earth with constantly flowing water\u2014though this water is so filled with iron that it looks like something else entirely.The study also measured the amount of iron-rich brine in the river water and found the brine content increased as the measurements drew closer to the falls.Water temperature and brine content were also found to be related: Cracks of various sizes in the glacier let brine into the glacier. Then the brine (pictured here in red to represent the amount of iron present in the water) begins to freeze, and the latent heat warms the ice around it, upping the brine concentration in the center of the cracks.\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
