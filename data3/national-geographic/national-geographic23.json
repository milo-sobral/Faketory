The bridge seems to be of little significance; no water runs beneath it. Few, if any, of the tour buses shuttling visitors to the temple grounds every day stop for tourists to have a look.But to Dan Penny, an expert in environmental history who has studied the Angkor civilization for many years, the bridge tells an intriguing story. Its damage in the recent past, he says, is a reminder that while it was water\u2014or the control of it\u2014that built the city of Angkor, it was also water that helped destroy it.The cause of the Angkor empire\u2019s demise in the early 15th century long remained a mystery. But researchers have now shown that intense monsoon rains that followed a prolonged drought in the region caused widespread damage to the city\u2019s infrastructure, leading to its collapse.\u201cThe destruction of this bridge is suggestive of a huge flow of water, far more than the canal could cope with, coming down through the middle of the city,\u201d said Penny, who is a researcher in the geosciences department at the University of Sydney.\u201cIt did a huge amount of damage to infrastructure that people who were living here at the time simply couldn\u2019t repair.\u201dThe Angkor Wat temples in Siem Reap, Cambodia, were unknown to the West until the 19th century.The Angkor period is said to have begun in the year 802 when, from a location in the Kulen Mountains overlooking the future city plain, Jayavarman II proclaimed himself chakravartin, or \u201cgod king,\u201d of the Khmer empire. Over the next few centuries, a vast urban complex with nearly one million inhabitants emerged as Angkor grew into the biggest city of the pre-industrial world.From the beginning, water was central to the development of Angkor, which is often described as a \u201chydraulic city.\u201d Channels and reservoirs were constructed to collect and store water coming from the hills, both for flood control and for distribution for agriculture. A system of overflows and bypasses carried surplus water to the Tonle Sap Lake to the south of the city.\u201cIt was a water management infrastructure that had no equal on Earth,\u201d said Penny.Water, and the control of it, also played a religious role in Angkor society.\u201cWater was not only a resource that had to be managed in terms of agriculture and flooding,\u201d said Penny. \u201cIt was also tied up with the power of the king.\u201dThe canal network had a history of additions and modifications. Earlier channels both distributed and disposed of water. From the 12th century onwards\u2014around the time the most famous temple, Angkor Wat, was built and the empire reached its apogee\u2014the large new channels primarily disposed of water to the lake.Over the next couple of centuries, the system seems to have functioned pretty well as the city continued to flourish. But then, in the mid to late 1300s, Angkor began suffering from a persistent drought. This was followed by several years of unusually strong monsoon rains, producing extensive flooding with which the city\u2019s infrastructure seemed to have been unable to cope.The flooding caused serious erosion in the system, with links in it being systematically severed. To the south of the city, canals were choked with material eroded from the center of Angkor.The bridge at Angkor Thom was built from reused stone blocks from temples, with many of them carved in intricate ways.\u201cThat they would take apart a temple and use it for something as mundane as a bridge suggests there is something seriously going wrong,\u201d said Penny.\u201cIt has long been thought that the damage to the water management system put an end to a long period of decline at Angkor.\u201dJudging by the damage done to the bridge, which had its eastern end destroyed, the efforts to control the floodwaters were ultimately unsuccessful. In the end, the Siem Reap River, which was supposed to run under it, carved a way around the bridge. Today, the river runs about 25 feet below its original course.As the flooding destroyed the infrastructure, the city of Angkor collapsed. In 1431, it was taken by the Siamese army. Many of the temples were later overgrown by jungle, while others remained important religious sites for the Khmer. The ruins were unknown to the West until French explorers were taken there in the 1860s.

But this may have had adverse environmental consequences, destabilizing the city and eventually leading to its demise.\u201cThe medieval Khmer were confronted with a period of climatic instability that they had no experience of, and which fully changed the rules of the game that they had been playing for hundreds of years,\u201d said Penny.\u201cA similar scale of challenge is now confronting contemporary communities, as the climate begins to change.\u201d\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
