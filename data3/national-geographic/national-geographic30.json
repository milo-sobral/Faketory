Lee writes, \u201cFantastic composition Anthony. I like the way you framed the hummingbird with the flower petals, it helps draw my eye to the feeding bird. You are also offering a sense of scale to the hummingbird. Also great job shooting this moment at a high shutter speed (1/4000 second) which freezes the wings. Well done.\u201d Photograph by Anthony PenzaTop Shot features the photo with the most votes from the previous day\u2019s Daily Dozen, 12 photos selected by the Your Shot editors.
