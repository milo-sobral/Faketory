But this time around, the area near the infamous fault has caught people\u2019s attention due to a mysterious pot of bubbling mud.Refusing to stay in place, a roiling mass of carbon dioxide and slurry-like soil is migrating across the state at a pace of 20 feet a year. So far, it\u2019s carved a 24,000-square-foot basin out of the earth, and it\u2019s set to continue its crusade until whatever\u2019s driving it dies out. Scientists currently have no real idea why it\u2019s moving or if it can be stopped.So, what do we know about it?Researchers may have discovered why a mud eruption on the Indonesian island of Java has continued spewing since May 2006.This curiosity appeared in the Salton Trough, an area of California that\u2019s being stretched apart by a tectonic battle between the forces of the San Andreas Fault and the East Pacific Rise, a mid-ocean ridge. This unique environment is where the Colorado River dumps plenty of its sediment, which gets packed up so that the lower layers a few miles down get heated up and squashed a little. (Find out how a powerful earthquake snapped a tectonic plate in two.)This low-grade metamorphic action transforms the sediment into new rock types, and in the process, CO2 gets emitted. Escaping up to the soggy surface through pre-existing cracks and faults, this gas fuels features known as mud pots or\u2014if they\u2019re protruding from the ground\u2014mud volcanoes.Mud pots and volcanoes are common but normally stationary objects. That\u2019s why scientists sat up and took notice when this mud pot began to move sometime between 2015 and 2016.Currently located just north of Niland, the mud pot is moving toward Union Pacific Railroad tracks and giving engineers there a headache. A well dug to depressurize the source of the gas had no effect. Steel walls driven 80 feet into the ground were also nonchalantly circumvented; the mud pot simply ducked under them and continued its freakishly linear path of destruction.\u201cNo one has seen a moving mud pot before,\u201d says David Lynch, a consulting physicist who has long studied the area\u2019s geothermal features. Mud pots and mud volcanoes also generally don\u2019t emit much water, but this one is extremely vigorous, producing somewhere around 40,000 gallons of water a day. Lynch and other experts have taken to calling it a \u201cmud spring.\u201dSo, why is it moving? \u201cThat is the big question, and I don't know the answer,\u201d Lynch says. It isn\u2019t accelerating, as some news outlets have reported, and it certainly didn\u2019t move 60 feet in a single day. Contrary to a handful of reports, there is no link between seismic changes in the area and the mud pot\u2019s road show.\u201cThis mud spring\u2019s movement has no relation whatsoever to any variation in seismicity,\u201d says Ken Hudnut, a research geophysicist working with the U.S. Geological Survey. \u201cThe two are unrelated.\u201d The San Andreas Fault is one of the most heavily monitored seismic zones on the planet, he adds, so people can rest assured that the muddy monster isn\u2019t in any way a harbinger of a massive earthquake.In a similar vein, the traveling mud pot is not related to volcanic activity, despite the inadvertent implication when the County of Imperial recently described it as a geyser. Geothermal systems driven by magmatic heat can feature their own mud pots and mud volcanoes, as Yellowstone National Park beautifully demonstrates.But in this case, \u201cit\u2019s been thousands of years since any volcanic activity occurred down there,\u201d Hudnut says. The Salton Buttes, five volcanic domes that formed within the last 12,000 years, hint at the region\u2019s magmatic past, but they are showing no signs of eruptive activity. Also, the mud spring itself isn\u2019t at all hot or boiling, despite its appearance; rather, it\u2019s at an ambient temperature. (Here are the most dangerous U.S. volcanoes, according to the USGS.)The spring also smells of rotten eggs, a sure sign that hydrogen sulfide is being emitted. Although frequently linked to volcanic activity, in this case, bacteria may be to blame. The area contains a saline lake called the Salton Sea. Formed by the explosion of an irrigation canal in 1905, today it\u2019s kept filled by agricultural runoff water, and fertilizers can cause algae populations in the lake to soar. When the algae die, bacteria feast upon them, excreting plenty of hydrogen sulfide.It\u2019s possible that the mud spring is tapping a similarly stinky reservoir. Alternatively, the smell could have a purely geologic origin, Lynch says.Aside from the fact that it\u2019s moving, the mud pot has only deepened the mystery of whether the area\u2019s geothermal protuberances can actually be tied to the San Andreas Fault. Previous research by Lynch and Hudnut had suggested that they may be related, but a link has yet to be established.This mud spring is close to\u2014but not on\u2014the Wister Fault, a southeastern extension of the San Andreas. However, it appears to be tracing a path that\u2019s at right angles to the region\u2019s major faults. It may be following another fault crossing through the area, but then it\u2019s unclear why the mud pot hasn\u2019t turned into a fissure-like opening, so that the escaping gas could take advantage of one long crack in the ground.It looks like the muddy mystery will persist for some time. Neither the USGS nor the California Geological Survey is actively studying the phenomenon; research is costly, and they have to pick their battles. Lynch says he\u2019s working on a model to explain it, but it\u2019s \u201cnot ready for primetime yet.\u201dIn the meantime, the mud pot\u2019s path threatens to undercut existing railroad tracks, so Union Pacific is using a shoofly\u2014a track detour\u2014as a contingency plan. At present, it seems the best anyone can do is simply step out of its way.\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
