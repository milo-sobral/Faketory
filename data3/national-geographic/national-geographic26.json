{"id": "Scenes from the new Cold War unfolding at the top of the world", "paragraph": "PUBLISHED October 25, 2018On a calm, bright morning in August 2007 a pair of Russian submersibles dropped 14,000 feet to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and planted a flag made of titanium at the North Pole. It was a bold move, made with drama in mind, and images broadcast around the world of the Russian tricolor standing on the seabed drew quick condemnation in the West.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the 15th century,\u201d said Peter MacKay, then foreign minister of Canada, on CTV television. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around the world and just plant flags and say, \u2018We\u2019re claiming this territory.\u2019\u201dMacKay was technically correct; the Russian stunt held no legal weight. But his rebuke carried a note of petulance, as though he wished the whole thing had been Canada\u2019s idea. Ten years on, MacKay\u2019s reaction is easier to understand. 2007 was, at the time, one of the warmest years on record, and the Arctic summer ice pack\u2014the vast expanse of floating ice that covers the North Pole even through the summer\u2014had shrunk to the lowest levels ever recorded. The frozen polar sea, foil to human ambition for centuries, appeared to be melting, and Russia was staking a symbolic claim on whatever lay beneath the slush.Frost-faced members of a Canadian aircrew head back to hot meals and showers after enduring a week of temperatures as low as -60\u00b0C during an outdoor survival course.\u201cThe summer of 2007 saw the largest Arctic ice-loss in human history and was not predicted by even the most aggressive climate models,\u201d says Jonathan Markowitz, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. \u201cThis shock led everyone to suddenly understand that the ice was rapidly disappearing and some nations decided to start making moves.\u201dIn the decade since that \u201cshock event,\u201d the Arctic has been transformed by rising temperatures, vanishing ice, and international attention. Countries with Arctic territory\u2014and some nations with no polar borders\u2014have been scrambling for advantage on the Earth\u2019s latest frontier. Entrepreneurs, prospectors, and politicians have all turned north, recognizing that less ice means more access to the region\u2019s rich stores of fish, gas, oil, and other mineral resources.\u201cPredictions about the Arctic Ocean have been wrong,\u201d says Michael Sfraga, director of the Polar Initiative at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s an ocean opening up before us, in real time. This hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dPacificoceanBeringSeaAnchorageAlaska(U.S.)Black Rapids200 miFairbanks200 kmCherskiyChukchiSeaEastSiberianSeaUtqiagvik(Barrow)DeadhorseBeaufort SeaSiberiacanadabanksIslandLaptevSeaRussiaVictoriaIslandNordvikArcticOceanRussian ClaimQueen ElizabethIslandsNorthPoleResoluteNorilskKaraSeaHallBeachDanishClaimFranz JosefLand(Russia)BaffinIslandBaffinBayClyde RiverBarentsSeaSalekhardSvalbard(Norway)RussianClaimgreenland(Denmark)NorwegianClaimDanishClaimMurmanskrussiaNorwegianClaimJan mayen(Norway)NorwayDenmarkNorwegian SeaicelandfinlandSwedenNGM MAPSSix nations\u2014the U.S., Canada, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark\u2014have land borders above the Arctic Circle. In recent years, the receding ice has allowed increasing amounts of international shipping traffic to move between the Atlantic and Pacific.But Arctic investment has been uneven, and some nations are vastly outperforming others. Russia and Norway have been the most proactive Arctic nations, according to Markowitz, spending heavily on natural gas and oil infrastructure. Russia\u2019s ice-capable fleet is the largest in the world, numbering some 61 icebreakers and ice-hardened ships with another 10 under construction. Norway's ice-hardened fleet has grown from 5 to 11 ships. South Korean shipyards are busy building ice-hardened cargo vessels, and China has invested billions in Russia\u2019s liquid natural gas network.The Chinese are more than passive investors, however, and their Arctic maneuvers tend to generate some of the loudest headlines. In 2016, a Chinese mining company tried to buy an abandoned naval base in Greenland. In 2017, the first Chinese icebreaker sailed through the Northwest Passage on a scientific survey. And in 2018, the Chinese government published a white paper outlining its Arctic plans\u2014and its intention to play a greater role in the region.Other Arctic nations, including the United States, Canada, and Denmark, lavish far less attention on their northern territories. Sfraga and others have called the U.S. a \u201creluctant Arctic power,\u201d and Markowitz points out that although Canada often talks about raising its northern game, there\u2019s little behind the words.\u201cNational interests are largely a function of income and revenue,\u201d Markowitz says. \u201cWhat states make influence what they take, and states that make things\u2014like the U.S.\u2014are much less interested in securing Arctic resources. The Russians, on the other hand, don\u2019t make much. They don\u2019t have a Silicon Valley or a New York City and they view the Arctic as their strategic future resource base.\u201dThe disequilibrium in Arctic approaches has worried some observers and led to news headlines that regularly describe the Arctic as a kind of Wild West, or as a frigid theater where nations will square off in the next Cold War. Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea in 2014 and China\u2019s ongoing play for military dominance in the South China Sea have intensified anxiety.Markowitz, who has been tracking military development in the Arctic for years, says that Russia maintains 27 operational military bases above the Arctic Circle, more than double the number it had before the \u201cshock event\u201d of 2007. The U.S., in contrast, keeps just one base in the Arctic, an air force installation on borrowed ground in Greenland. Canada, which is second only to Russia in the size of its northern territory, has only three small Arctic bases.U.S. soldiers drop over the Donnelly Training Area near Fort Greely, Alaska. In October 2018, the training area hosted some 6,000 soldiers during a war games exercise named Arctic Anvil.Canadian and American forces do operate bases just south of the Arctic Circle, though, in Alaska and the Northwest Territories, and Sfraga said both nations are capable of rapidly dispatching aircraft, troops, and submarines into Arctic territory. The two nations are also slowly expanding their cold-weather military infrastructure. Canada is building a naval refueling base on Baffin Island, and the U.S. announced plans earlier this year to re-establish the Navy\u2019s Second Fleet, which will counter Russian activity in the North Atlantic.In the meantime, Canadian and U.S. forces, along with other members of NATO, continue to regularly train for cold weather conflict. Today, in Norway, NATO opens its largest training exercise since the end of the Cold War\u2014two-weeks of war games involving 50,000 troops from 31 nations. The massive operation, called Trident Juncture, imagines a scenario in which northern Norway is invaded, prompting allies to rush to its defense. The gallery here reveals how extreme even practicing for a war in the north can be.While the imaginary enemy in Trident Juncture isn\u2019t named, Norway shares Arctic land and sea borders with Russia, and tension between the two nations has risen in recent years. Some observers worry that future disputes between the neighbors over fishing or mineral rights could pull the NATO alliance into a conflict for which it is unprepared.Still, the Arctic remains one of the world\u2019s calmer regions, where contact between nations is relatively open and stable. Russia, Norway, the U.S., and five other Arctic countries are all members of the Arctic Council, a group formed in 1996 to encourage communication and cooperation across the pole. Even as NATO forces gather in Norway, the council continues coordinating meetings on Arctic science, environmental issues, and search-and-rescue operations.Sfraga and Markowitz agree that the Arctic Council, operating outside the military framework of NATO, offers one of the best paths forward for easing strain. Some experts also point to the south pole\u2014where an international treaty has preserved Antarctica \u201cfor peaceful purposes only\u201d\u2014as a model for what could be possible in the Arctic.\u201cKeep moving\u201d is a key principle in Arctic military operations, when anything\u2014or anyone\u2014standing still long in subzero temperatures risks freezing in place. Here, Canadian Captain Wayne LeBlanc and Master Corporal Jeff Valentiate walk north on Cornwallis Island.For now, many military and political analysts consider the Arctic an unlikely battlefield. Global warming has begun transforming the region, but the qualities that have frustrated human ambition and desire in the north for hundreds of years remain powerful.\u201cIf it came to war in the Arctic, you\u2019d really be fighting two enemies,\u201d Brigadier General Mike Nixon said last year at the headquarters of Canada\u2019s Joint Task Force North, in Yellowknife. \u201cAnd the more dangerous of them would be the cold.\u201dNixon was careful to say that Russia\u2019s Arctic military activity remains well below Cold War levels, and he dismissed the idea of potential land grabs or invasions. The cold is too intense, he said, the ice pack still vast and thick, the polar distances enormous. Planting a flag at the bottom of the sea is one thing. Sending troops across the ice is quite another.\u201cIf someone actually decided to launch an attack over the pole,\u201d Nixon said, \u201cit would quickly turn into the largest search and rescue operation the world has ever seen.\u201d\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
