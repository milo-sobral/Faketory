{"id": "'Biggest case on the planet' pits kids vs. climate change", "paragraph": "These young people are among the group suing for the right to a stable climate. Left to right they are Aji Piper, Levi Draheim, Journey Zephier, Jayden Foytlin, Miko Vergun, and Nathan Baring.PUBLISHED November 9, 2018Levi Draheim is a nine-year-old science geek. He founded an environmental club as a fourth grader and gives talks about climate change to audiences of grown-ups. His home is on a slender barrier island on Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, 21 miles south of Cape Canaveral and a five-minute walk from the beach. By mid-century, his sandy childhood playground could be submerged by rising seas. He will be just 42.Nathan Baring is 17 and a high school junior in Fairbanks, Alaska\u2014120 miles south of the Arctic Circle. He loves cold weather and skis. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Now winter snows that Baring once celebrated as early as August in Fairbanks can hold off until November.By 2050, Arctic sea ice will have virtually disappeared, and temperatures in the interior, surrounding Fairbanks, will have risen by an additional 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit, altering the boreal forest ecosystem. Nathan will be 50.\u201cI can deal with a few days of rain in February when it\u2019s supposed to be 40 below,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t deal with the idea that what my parents experienced and what I have experienced will not exist for my children. I am a winter person. I won\u2019t sit idly by and watch winter vanish.\u201dBaring and Draheim so lack confidence that they will inherit a healthy planet that they are suing the United States government for failing to adequately protect the Earth from the effects of climate change. They are among a group of 21 youths who claim the federal government\u2019s promotion of fossil fuel production and its indifference to the risks posed by greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in \u201ca dangerous destabilizing climate system\u201d that threatens the survival of future generations. That lapse violates, the court papers argue, their fundamental constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. The lawsuit also argues that the government violated the public trust doctrine, a legal concept grounded in ancient law that holds the government is responsible for protecting public resources, such as land and water\u2014or in this case, the climate system\u2014for public use.The kids\u2019 lawsuit was joined by acclaimed NASA climate scientist James Hansen, who began studying climate change in the 1970s and whose granddaughter, Sophie, is among the 21 young plaintiffs.\u201cIn my opinion, this lawsuit is made necessary by the at-best schizophrenic, if not suicidal nature of U.S. climate and energy policy,\u201d he told the court.Last fall, U.S. District Court Judge Anne Aiken agreed with the youths\u2019 claim. Her sweeping 54-page opinion laid the foundation for what looks to be a groundbreaking trial later this year. In her ruling, Aiken established, in effect, a new right for these children and teens: a right to expect they could live in a stable climate.\u201cI have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society,\u201d Aiken wrote. \u201cJust as marriage is the foundation of the family, a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.\u201dShe made clear that \u201cthis lawsuit is not about proving that climate change is happening or that human activity is driving it. For purposes of this motion, those facts are undisputed.\u201dAnd Aikens added: \u201cFederal courts too often have been cautious and overly deferential in the arena of environmental law and the world has suffered for it.\u201dMary Wood, a University of Oregon environmental law professor who pioneered the concept that the atmosphere should be treated as part of the public trust, calls the lawsuit \u201cthe biggest case on the planet.\u201d\u201cThis claim challenges the government\u2019s entire fossil-fuel philosophy. The whole thing,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThe scientists, on the other hand, are saying if we continue on our path without drastic cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, we are going to leave a barren planet that will not support broad human survival. You could not get claims more grave than that.\u201dThe lawsuit originally was filed against the Obama administration, which sought to have the case dismissed because the courts are \u201cill-suited\u201d to oversee \u201ca phenomenon that spans the globe,\u201d according to court papers.\u201cClimate change is a very serious problem,\u201d Sean Duffy, a Justice Department lawyer told the court last September. \u201cWe do not question the science. Climate change threatens our environment and our ecosystems. It alters our climate systems and it will only worsen over time. It is the result of man-made emissions. Now where (the parties) disagree is as to who determines how to address climate change in the first instance. Our position is that Congress and the Executive Branch should address climate change in the first instance and should do so by coordinating with other nations.\u201dSeveral groups representing the fossil-fuel industry, including the American Petroleum Institute, joined the lawsuit as intervenors, but disagreed \u201cto the extent of climate change, to the emissions that cause it, and to other scientific principles,\u201d Quin Sorenson, a lawyer representing the industry, argued in court.The case could prove even more consequential with the change of administration because of President Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back climate regulations put in place by his predecessor. Last week, the Trump administration shifted course on the case and asked that a federal appeals court review Judge Aiken\u2019s decision to proceed to trial.\u201cWhatever happens next, this is a case to watch,\u201d says Michael Burger, a Columbia University law professor and specialist in climate law. \u201cIt\u2019s out there, ahead of the curve. And given the change in administration and President Trump\u2019s views on climate change, this may be a potential hook to keep things moving along the climate change front. It may be the opening salvo in what will be an increasing number of lawsuits that take a rights-based approach to climate change in the United States.\u201dIn challenging the government\u2019s role in climate change on constitutional grounds Julia Olson, the plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, harkens to the realm of historic Supreme Court cases that established new constitutional protections in situations when Congress failed to act. Those cases include the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that banned segregation in public schools and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage.The climate change lawsuit makes essentially a straightforward request. It asks a federal judge to order the government to write a recovery plan to reduce carbon emissions to 350 parts per million by 2100 (down from 400 parts per million) and stabilize the climate system.The courts are needed to step in, Olson argued, because the government has not\u2014despite knowing for more than 50 years that the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming.Olson first tuned in to the climate change threat when, eight months pregnant with her youngest child, she watched An Inconvenient Truth, former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s 2006 Oscar-winning climate change documentary at her local moviehouse.\u201cThere is something about carrying life inside your body that is transformative and gives you a different kind of perspective on the world,\u201d she says.She founded Our Children\u2019s Trust, a nonprofit with a mission to protect children from climate change, and now serves as executive director. The trust is assisting in the case. Olson has also filed climate change lawsuits in each of the 50 states, which are proceeding separately. She has won cases in Washington, Massachusetts, and New Mexico.Similar lawsuits, brought by other lawyers, are playing out in other nations, including Belgium and New Zealand, and have been won in Pakistan, Austria and South Africa. Last year, a Dutch court ordered the government to reduce carbon emissions by a quarter within the next five years.Olson\u2019s clients in the federal suit range in age from nine to 20. They are media savvy environmental activists who understand the power of connecting the future effects of climate change to the people who will have to live with them.Kiran Oommen, 19, a student at Seattle University, says he joined the lawsuit because it gives voice to his generation.\u201cWe have little or no representation in the government, yet the effects of climate change will affect us more than anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a way we can speak for ourselves and stand up for our future.\u201dAji Piper, 16, is a high school student in Seattle who plants trees around the city and is an avid letter-writer to the state\u2019s polluting industries. He adds: \u201cOnce you start involving children, people start listening more. My role in the case is to sit there in court.\u201dThe climate kids, as the group is known, also are living the full menu of drought, deluge, heat, and extreme weather events that are rapidly becoming the unnerving norm. Not only has sea-level rise killed any long-term future Levi Draheim might have envisioned on Florida\u2019s Space Coast, but he has to cope with toxic algae blooms like the outbreak that befouled beaches last July and monster storms, such as Hurricane Matthew, which barreled up the Florida coast last October and eroded away much of the sand on his beach.Journey Zephier, 16, lives in Kauai, Hawaii, where ocean acidification is killing coral reefs and coastal fisheries. Miko Vergun, 16, who lives in the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Beaverton, fears she may never be able to visit her native Marshall Islands in the remote Pacific Ocean before they disappear beneath the swells. Tidal flooding, she says in court papers, is so frequent now that a fifth of the population has already moved away.Last August, Jayden Foytlin, 13, awoke one morning to flood waters seeping into her bedroom in Rayne, Louisiana, as a rainstorm that lasted two weeks flooded more than 60,000 homes and killed 13 people. Foytlin\u2019s home was soon awash in sewage. The Foytlins do not live in the flood plain, yet the raging waters destroyed their home and all of their belongings.\u201cThis flood has been called a thousand-year event,\u201d Foytlin told the court. \u201cYet within the last two years, I have read about eight \u2018500-year\u2019 events. In less than two years, there have been nine flood events that are not even supposed to happen in my lifetime. My family and I feel very vulnerable.\u201dDespite winning a trial, prevailing ultimately remains an uphill climb. Columbia\u2019s Burger says Judge Aiken\u2019s unprecedented order that the case go to trial \u201cis a great opinion for environmental law.\u201dBut, he warns: \u201cAs it moves up on appeal and ultimately to the Supreme Court, the chances get less and less that that opinion survives in its current form.\u201dTo date, courts have never recognized a constitutional right to even a natural environment free of pollutants, let alone to a stable climate.After Judge Aiken ruled, proponents urged Obama to settle the case before Trump took office. Obama declined. The government also declined to ask for an appellate review of her order; government lawyers instead proceeded toward trial. Seven days before Trump was sworn in as president, government lawyers added a routine brief to the court file that may complicate the Trump administration\u2019s effort to argue the science and halt the trial.In the brief, government lawyers conceded nearly every point on which the plaintiffs\u2019 case against the government was constructed. These admissions include the government\u2019s role in promoting the development of fossil fuels and its belief that greenhouse gases are at \u201cunprecedentedly high levels compared to the past 800,000 years ... and pose risks to human health and welfare.\u201dThe government went so far as to point out where the plaintiffs had understated the evidence against the government in court papers. They then corrected the figures, raising them upwards.\u201cThey recognized the importance of this case and tried to make sure when the Obama administration left, that the government\u2019s position was clear and the court shouldn\u2019t spend time in trial worrying about facts that should not be contested,\u201d says Phil Gregory, the plaintiffs\u2019 co-counsel.Now, the Trump administration appears to have reversed course. Last week, government lawyers asked Judge Aiken to grant their request that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals review her order. Halting the trial, the lawyers wrote, could avoid litigation that \u201cis unprecedented in its scope, in its potential to be protracted, expensive and disruptive to the continuing operation of the United States Government.\u201dThe appellate review is unlikely to be granted, because the decision is up to Judge Aiken, the judge who ordered the trial to proceed. In common practice, appeals courts decline to consider appeals until a trial concludes.In a separate motion, government lawyers are also fighting a request by the youth\u2019s lawyers that the Justice Department preserve all documents relevant to the lawsuit, including information on climate change, energy, and emissions.Even if a review is granted, it may be difficult for the Trump administration to reverse the government\u2019s statements and acknowledgements about climate change that are already part of the record. Still, the new administration\u2019s position on the subject is becoming increasingly clear. Two days after the government\u2019s motions were filed, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt swept aside established science on the connection between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming and declared that \u201ccarbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\u201d\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
