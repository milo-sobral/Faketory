{"id": "She designed a device to look for signs of past life on Mars", "paragraph": "If there\u2019s ever been life on Mars, she could be the one to find it.To discover the earliest signs of life on Earth, astrobiologist Abigail Allwood trekked to an isolated Australian desert. Now she\u2019s searching for signs of life from a distance, on a planet where she will probably never go.Allwood works at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and is a principal investigator for the Mars 2020 rover mission\u2014the first mission, she says, with \u201cthe primary objective of searching for evidence of past life on Mars.\u201d Allwood\u2019s job is to examine the chemical composition of the red planet for evidence of ancient microbes.For that she designed the planetary instrument for x-ray lithochemistry, PIXL for short. It looks like \u201ca storm trooper\u2019s lunch box,\u201d she says, but underneath the white cover is the \u201cmost complicated instrument ever sent to the surface of another planet.\u201d Mounted on the arm of the rover, it will position itself with three pairs of legs, then move across the Martian surface in tiny 100-micron-size steps. As it proceeds, it will analyze the chemical makeup of different areas, mapping the elements distributed there.Allwood hesitates to say what exactly she hopes to discover: \u201cIf you go with preconceived notions of what you need to find, then you\u2019ll be blind to what is there.\u201d But she is optimistic. \u201cThe chances of finding something on Mars that\u2019s interesting are high,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will have the ability to figure out what it is, one way or another.\u201d\u00a9 1996-2018 National Geographic Society."}
