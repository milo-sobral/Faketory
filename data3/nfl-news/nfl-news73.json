{"id": "Midseason QB Index: Aaron Rodgers > Tom Brady", "paragraph": "\nTrailing 17-7 late in the third quarter in Baltimore, Drew Brees stared at a third-and-8 in his own territory. It was the Saints' sixth possession of the Week 7 game, the sun was down and they were running out of chances. The Ravens sent a perfectly timed safety blitz, a free rusher that should have proved decisive, but Brees found a way to complete a pass with Tony Jefferson draped all over him. Seventeen fourth-quarter points later, the Saints kept their undefeated road record intact. These are the moments an MVP season is made of.My midseason QB Index rankings include some separation at the top, with Brees and Patrick Mahomes ahead of the field. Aaron Rodgers is a strong No. 3, with a deep group of quality quarterbacks behind him.There have never been so many quarterbacks playing so well at the same time, a reality reflected in the league's overall passing numbers. If this is the NFL's equivalent of a juiced-ball era, I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.NOTE: This is the Quarterback Index. The QBs are ranked based on 2018 play alone. The arrows reflect the changes since the first-quarter 32-man rankings. The quarterback who played the majority of snaps for each team from Weeks 5-8 is listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Gregg Rosenthal on Twitter @greggrosenthal.The Air Index delivered by FedEx ranks NFL quarterback performances all season long.
