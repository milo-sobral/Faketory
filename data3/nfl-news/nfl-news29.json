{"id": "Giants trading Damon 'Snacks' Harrison to Lions", "paragraph": " \u00a0\nThe Detroit Lions needed help on the defensive line and made a move Wednesday to bolster the interior ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline. The Lions acquired defensive tackle Damon \"Snacks\" Harrison from the New York Giants in exchange for a fifth-round pick, both teams confirmed. Harrison, a first-team All-Pro selection in 2016, has proven durable on his seven-year career, appearing in 87 games with 86 starts since the 2013 season. The 29-year-old Harrison's arrival should help out a Lions run defense that enters Week 8 ranked 30th in the league (139.3 yards allowed per game), and it comes at a good time. Detroit is set to square off against three of the Top-10 rushing offenses in the NFL in the next four games: Seattle Seahawks in Week 8, Chicago Bears in Week 10 and Carolina Panthers in Week 11. Meanwhile, the Giants sit on a 1-6 record and appear to be in a rebuild mode under first-year coach Pat Shurmur following Monday night's 23-20 loss, which marked the team's fourth consecutive defeat. On the heels of the loss, the Giants have now traded away two essential defensive players in the past 24 hours with a view to stocking up on future draft picks. On Tuesday, the team\u00a0shipped cornerback Eli Apple to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2019 and a seventh-round pick in 2020.By parting ways with Harrison, who has three years remaining on his contract, the Giants also freed up more than $8 million under the salary cap in 2019. Much love to my teammates, the amazing staffs, coaches, and all the fans. This is my second home because of you...\u00e2\u009c\u008c\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd pic.twitter.com/4VUAjkIHlu\nMore Posts\nPhoto Essay\r\n"}
