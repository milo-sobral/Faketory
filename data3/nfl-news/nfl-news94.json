The amount is standard for a first offense for taunting, Pelissero added.Byard's play occurred in the first quarter when he picked off a Dak Prescott pass in the end zone. The safety fell in the back of the end zone before jumping up and jogging out to midfield to the team logo, where he stood and extended his arms.

For his part, Byard thought his fine would hammer his wallet.\"With all the crazy fines that are going on in the league right now, I kind of expected it to be more than $10,000,\" Byard said, via The Tennessean. \"But hey, I mean, I feel like it was worth it. It was worth it.\"Here are the other fines levied from last week's games:1.
