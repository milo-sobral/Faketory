But there are plenty of differences between New York's Long Island City and Crystal City in northern Virginia. Crystal City is a thicket of 1980s-era office towers trying to plug into new economic energy. Long Island City is an old manufacturing area already being reinvented as a hub for industry, creativity and urbane living.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTech giants slide, pulling US stock market sharply lower\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A broad sell-off in technology companies pulled U.S. stocks sharply lower Monday, knocking more than 600 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Crude oil prices fell, erasing early gains. The jittery trading followed two weeks of mostly steady gains.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEU, UK inch closer to a deal as Brexit hangs in the balance\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 Britain and the European Union appear to be inching inched toward agreement on a Brexit deal, but British Prime Minister Theresa May faces intensifying pressure from feuding pro-EU and pro-Brexit factions of her divided Conservative government. Britain leaves the EU on March 29 \u2014 the first country ever to do so \u2014 but a deal must be sealed in the coming weeks to leave enough time for the U.K. Parliament and European Parliament to sign off.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAbu Dhabi summit: Oil production cuts may be necessary\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia's energy minister says OPEC and allied oil-producing countries will likely need to cut crude supplies, perhaps by as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day, to rebalance the market after U.S. sanctions on Iran failed to cut Tehran's output. His comments show the balancing act U.S. allies face in dealing with President Donald Trump's actions related to the oil industry.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPocket money apps aim to help kids in cashless world\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 For kids growing up in today's cashless society, the piggy bank is going virtual.

The country today has its weapons \u2014 and chronic power blackouts. Despite years of sanctions that limited its energy options, Kim Jong Un's North Korea has cobbled together a creative smorgasbord of alternative resources, some off the official grid and some flat-out illegal.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSmall businesses band together for Small Business Saturday\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Many small and independent retailers who are holding Small Business Saturday shopping events Thanksgiving weekend are banding together with others, believing here's strength in numbers. Small Business Saturday, started in 2010 to encourage consumers to shop in small local stores rather than national chains, has become an event in neighborhoods, towns, even cities as retailers recognize they can draw more customers as a cohesive group than by offering discounts and promotions on their own.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTrump complains about allies' spending after France trip\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Fresh from a trip to France where his brand of \"nationalism\" drew rebuke from his hosts, President Donald Trump says \"much was accomplished\" in his meetings. But he's raising a familiar complaint about U.S. allies' spending on defense. Trump tweeted Monday that the U.S. pays billions \"protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n50 countries vow to fight cybercrime - US and Russia don't\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Fifty nations and over 150 tech companies are pledging to do more to fight criminal activity on the internet, including interference in elections and hate speech.

Mustafa Akinci has told a news conference that Turkey is the \"logical\" route to markets for east Mediterranean gas, but that a Cyprus peace deal must precede any such plans.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe S&P 500 index dropped 54.79 points, or 2 percent, to 2,726.22.
