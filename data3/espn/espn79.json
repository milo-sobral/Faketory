Republican Rep. Steve Pearce, who is running for governor, won his last bid for reelection by almost 30 points.\n\nDespite the district\u2019s political history, ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight forecasts the race between Torres Small and Republican Yyvette Herrell as a toss-up. Torres Small has also raised nearly $3 million through September 30, nearly double that of Herrell.\n\n\u00a1S\u00f3lo quedan dos d\u00edas para votar temprano!

A special thanks to Kellyanne Conway for joining us this evening. Lincoln County, it\u2019s time to get out to the polls so we can win this thing! #nmpol pic.twitter.com/mW9GOyTaFi\n\nSeveral of the first-time candidate\u2019s issues focus on the challenges residents in rural communities face. As a water rights attorney, many of her cases involved protecting water for farmers in the state. As a field representative for U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., she worked to increase cellphone service and broadband. And she has said in Congress she\u2019d like to make improvements in the state\u2019s public education system because so many people in the district face unique challenges in obtaining a quality public education.\n\nIn a crowded Republican primary, Herrell distinguished herself with vocal support for Trump and a reliably conservative voting record, according to the Las Cruces Sun-News.\n\nNo matter which candidate wins on Tuesday, the 2nd Congressional district will be sending its first woman to Washington represent it."}
