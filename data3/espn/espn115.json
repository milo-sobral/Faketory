He was wearing \u201cplain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard,\u201d Illinois State Police said in a preliminary investigation report released Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe GoFundMe campaign was created on the day Roberson died with a goal of $150,000. But as of Saturday afternoon, it had raised more than $305,000. The largest donation came in 10 increments of $15,000 each by a user under the name of Kanye West.\n\nWest and his representatives did not immediately respond to requests to confirm the donations.\n\n\n\nMidlothian police were responding to calls of a shooting at the bar when they found Roberson in the parking lot. In a statement released on Tuesday, Illinois State Police said that Roberson ignored commands to drop his gun.\n\n\n\nGreg Kulis, attorney for the Roberson family, said witnesses were yelling at the officers, telling them that Roberson was a security guard, when the officer aimed his gun and shot Roberson.\n\nMidlothian police called the incident \u201cthe equivalent of a \u2018blue-on-blue,\u2019 a friendly fire incident.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s name has not been released, and he is currently on paid administrative leave. Kulis and a local pastor are calling for the officer to resign or be terminated."}
