Ron DeSantis and is a member of an ever-growing class of progressives aligning themselves with the agenda of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nGillum won the Democratic primary by only a few points against Gwen Graham. That election wasn\u2019t supposed to be easy for Gillum, because Graham\u2019s father was once the state\u2019s governor and a U.S. senator. She took on the role of centrist to appeal to voters, but in the final weeks leading up to the primaries, her lead started to fade and Gillum was able to inch to a three-point victory.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s staked his platform in single-payer health care and tax reform. He\u2019s advocated for restructuring ICE and impeaching President Donald Trump.\n\nHis progressive campaign has allowed him to amass support from the largest left-wing donors, including Democratic financier George Soros. Between Soros and his sons, Gillum has raised $1.3 million alone, according to Politico.\n\n\n\nThe race has gotten increasingly testy between DeSantis and Gillum. DeSantis recently said at a rally that Gillum would appoint \u201cSoros-backed activists\u201d to statehouse positions if he were appointed. He has also urged FOX News viewers not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for Gillum in November.\n\n\n\nGillum has also been a target of racist robocalls paid for by a white nationalist group from Idaho.\n\n\n\n\"Well, hello there. I is the negro Andrew Gillum and I'll be askin' you to make me governor of this here state of Florida,\" the call says.\n\nDeSantis denounced the calls and said he didn't know who was making them, although the group made similar robocalls mocking California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\n\nGillum hasn\u2019t shied away from President Trump\u2019s attacks toward him online. On Monday, Trump posted a tweet calling for the support of DeSantis, in which he called Gillum a \u201cthief,\u201d likely in regards to the FBI investigation.\n\nIn Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!\n\nGillum fired back the same way he did when Trump attacked him in August, by telling him to tag him directly in the tweet and urging Floridians to vote.\n\nOn Twitter there is a choice between having the courage to @ the person you are trash talking, or not. @realDonaldTrump is howling because he's weak. Florida, go vote today. https://t.co/I8uOokptJA\n\nOn Tuesday, Gillum talked with ABC News Live in response to Trump's attacks against him.\n\nAndrew Gillum responds to Trump's attacks: \"I think it's pretty pitiful ... but I will tell you this much, he's met his match. I don't believe in backing down and certainly won't when it comes to standing up for the things we believe,\" he tells @devindwyer https://t.co/FAD5CxCZCA pic.twitter.com/awHP4gvktF\n\n\"I think its pretty pitiful the president of the United States is engaged in this way. But I will tell you this much, he's met his match,\" Gillum said. \"I don't believe in backing down and certainly won't when it comes to standing up for the things we believe.\"\n\n\"I would encourage the president, instead of tweeting about me, to convene leaders in this hemisphere around what we're going to do with the thousands of individuals fleeing their homeland,\" Gillum said.\n\nTrump at a rally last week condemned the attacks coming from candidates on both sides of the aisle, saying \"those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective -- have to do that. The language of moral condemnation and destructive routine, these are the arguments and disagreements that have to stop.\"\n\nWhen asked by @devindwyer about the caravan, Andrew Gillum says President Trump \"should consider what steps we\u2019re taking that are leading to people needing to leave their own homelands, and figure out what a humanitarian solution might be to this problem\u201d https://t.co/FAD5CxCZCA pic.twitter.com/YA0J8D5TGO\n\nGillum called the president out for just that.\n\n\"Instead of tamping down on that kind of rhetoric, he's sitting around here stoking it. That isn't leadership. I would recommend that the president be the president. Let us run this race here in Florida. His candidate is doing so well,\" Gillum said. \"I get that they've got anxiety about that but there's enough differences between me and Mr. DeSantis on the issues that we don't have to resort to name calling.\"\n\nBorn in Miami, his mother drove a school bus and his father was a construction worker. He\u2019s one of seven children and the first in his family to graduate high school and go to college, according to the Sun Sentinel. He was the youngest person elected to the Tallahassee City Commission at 23.\n\n\n\nGillum boasts economic development and a focus on the underrepresented worker. Under his mayorship, Tallahassee was selected for Obama\u2019s TechHire program, which provides resources to underrepresented workers in the tech field, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHis campaign has run into some trouble with the FBI, after agents subpoenaed \u201cthousands of pages of documents from key players in city government,\u201d according to the Tampa Bay Times. Gillum accepted a ticket to the award-winning Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d in New York from an undercover FBI agent who was investigating corruption in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nGillum in the governor\u2019s debate said that although he is not the direct subject of the investigation, he has \u201czero tolerance for corruption.\u201d He also said that he should have asked more questions about where the ticket came from before accepting it.\n\n\"I\u2019m running for governor, in the state of Florida we got a lot of issues, in fact we have 99 issues and 'Hamilton' ain\u2019t one of them,\" Gillum said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the cloud of a federal investigation over his head and the unlikely odds of his victory over Graham in the primaries, ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight forecasts Gillum with a three in four chance of taking the governor\u2019s mansion."}
