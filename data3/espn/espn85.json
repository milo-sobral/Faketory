The new guidelines advocate for more aggressive treatment with statin therapy and getting LDL cholesterol counts, commonly referred to as \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to your target level \u2013- in general, less than 100mg/dL; for those with risk factors, less than 70mg/dL.\n\n\n\nWhat is cholesterol?\n\nCholesterol is a type of fat found in blood and cells. It travels in bundles called lipoproteins. Cholesterol itself isn\u2019t bad -- the body needs it to make hormones, vitamin D and digestive fluids, and it helps organs function properly. But having too much cholesterol can be a problem.\n\nThere are two forms of cholesterol:\n\n- LDL (low-density lipoprotein): \u201cbad,\u201d unhealthy cholesterol. It builds up in arteries forming plaques, which can block the flow of oxygen-carrying blood to major organs including the heart, and has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular events including heart attacks and stroke. LDL levels are influenced by the food you eat, genetics, liver function and other factors.\n\n- HDL (high-density lipoprotein): \u201cgood,\u201d healthy cholesterol. It takes extra cholesterol out of arteries and delivers it to the liver, removing it from the body.\n\nHow do I know if I need to lower my cholesterol?\n\nThere are three tests to talk about with your doctor:\n\n- Non-fasting blood test to measure LDL cholesterol\n\n- Coronary artery calcium score\n\n- Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Estimator -- an equation to calculate the 10-year future risk of a heart attack\n\nBased on these tests, your doctor will decide if you should be on a statin.\n\n\n\nWhat can I do to lower my cholesterol?\n\nLifestyle changes including exercise, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking can prevent 80 percent of heart disease. Diet has been shown to be vitally important and effective in preventing heart attacks and reducing the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events in those who have already had a heart attack. Plant-based and Mediterranean diets are effective but you must find a diet that works for you. However, lifestyle changes may not be enough; you may need to take a statin to lower your LDL further.\n\n\n\nWhat are statins?\n\nStatins prevent heart attacks by lowering LDL and reducing inflammation, among other mechanisms. They can be used to prevent a heart attack or stroke before it occurs, or prevent a second heart attack or stroke.\n\nWhat are the side effects of statins?\n\nThe risk of serious side effects range from one in 500 to one in 1,000, which is considered very low. Muscle aches are a possible side effect, but are not considered serious. An increase in the dose of statins is not associated with an increase in side effects.\n\nWhat is the bottom line of the new recommendations?\n\nTalk to your doctor about what LDL level is right for you, and use the highest dose of statin tolerated to get to that target LDL level. And, as always, continue with lifestyle modifications, including exercise, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.\n"}
