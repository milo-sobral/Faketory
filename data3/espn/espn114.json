The military dictatorship that ruled Greece at the time violently put down the uprising, and many Greeks accuse the United States of supporting the 1967-74 regime.\nIn the end, most of the trouble happened elsewhere.\nPolice said a group of about 300 agitators in the capital erected barricades and threw firebombs and rocks at officers, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.\nIn Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, officers faced off with about 200 anarchists threw an intense barrage of firebombs. At least ten people were detained. Another five people were detained in Patras after an unknown number of assailants attacked officers, police said.\nAbout 15,000 people participated in the march held earlier to observe the 45th anniversary of the student rebellion. The precise number of deaths in the uprising is unknown. Estimates range from 18-40.\nWhile the event went off relatively trouble-free, government ministers and other marchers representing Greece's ruling Syriza party had plastic bottles and coffee cups thrown at them outside the embassy.\nAnd in an indication of what would come later, a group that marched past the embassy attacked officers at a subway station across from Athens police headquarters, authorities said. Eight suspects were detained, police said.\nTwo more were detained outside the university, also known as the Polytechnic.\nMunicipal workers had removed the trash cans that demonstrators often use as makeshift barricades, so desks and other furniture were brought out from the university in their place. Others climbed onto rooftops inside the Polytechnic complex and threw Molotov cocktails and rocks on officers.\nPolice brought a water cannon to the scene, but used it to put out fires because firetrucks would not approach the area.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCostas Kantouris reported from Thessaloniki.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFollow Kantouris on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CostasKantouris"}
