For women, arts, design, entertainment, sports and media were followed by protective service and health care support.\n\nThe study, published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly, looked at suicide rates by occupation within a group of 22,053 people, ages 16 to 64, in 17 participating states between 2012 and 2015. The authors note in their summary that the results are not nationally representative.\n\n\n\nDuring that time, suicide rates rose the sharpest among men working in arts, design, entertainment, sports and media, and among women working in food preparation and service-related occupations, the CDC study found.\n\n\u201cIncreasing suicide rates in the U.S. are a concerning trend that represent a tragedy for families and communities, and impact the American workforce,\u201d said Dr. Deb Houry, director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, in a press release.\n\n\n\n\nThe study noted that suicide rates increased across many occupational groups in the four years that were studied, and said that factors that contribute to suicide aren\u2019t limited exclusively to problems a person may have with his or her job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUsually stressful situations converge with decreased ability to tolerate distress, which leads a person to feel hopeless,\u201d psychiatrist Dr. Colette Poole-Boykin told ABC News.\n\nThe relationship between suicide and occupation might also be \u201cconfounded by access to lethal means on the job and socioeconomic factors such as lower income and education,\u201d the study's authors reported. The study did not, however, look deeper into these factors.\n\nThe CDC said that the new information may help workplace leaders better focus their prevention programs and policies. For high-stress jobs, these efforts may already be in place, Poole-Boykin said, noting that \u201cit would be wise to seek professional help when discontentment causes problems with [someone\u2019s] mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who are contemplating suicide often have changes in their mood, as well as the way they talk and behave,\u201d Poole-Boykin said.\n\n\n\nCommon signs, in addition to verbally expressing suicidal thoughts, include a person expressing feelings of being trapped or of being a burden to others, Poole-Boykin said. A person might also feel depressed, anxious, irritable -- or all three at once. He or she may lose interest in their usual hobbies or isolate themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen these warning signs are present, a person should seek mental health care as soon as possible,\u201d Poole-Boykin said, \u201cas it may be too difficult for the person to will themselves into a better mental state.\u201d\n\nIf you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741."}
