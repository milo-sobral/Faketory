Instead of building a family, they were scheduling chemo appointments. But through it all, Lowright never lost hope.\n\n\"This is not gonna take me,\" Lowright recalled telling herself when she received the news.\n\n\"I\u2019m gonna fight this. I\u2019m not gonna die from cancer,\" she told ABC News.\n\n\n\nA few years prior, Lowright had been told by her doctor to start getting yearly mammograms at the age of 31 due to her dense breast tissue makeup. In 2007 at the age of 33, she went in for her regular yearly appointment. Everything was clear. Not a hint of a tumor or a whisper of a cancer cell.\n\n\n\nOne year later, she was in Arizona on vacation when she received a recorded message from her doctor's office, reminding her to come in for her annual checkup. With a clean history, she didn\u2019t feel the need to rush home; she'd \"get it done\" when she was back. She scheduled her appointment after returning to Illinois and after donning the dressing gown and pressing herself up against the machine, she waited to hear from the doctor, expecting another clean bill of health.\n\nBut there was something on the scan. A tumor in the left breast.\n\nThe doctor ordered an ultrasound. Then a biopsy.\n\nAnd then the news Lowright's family feared the most: the cells were malignant.\n\n\"You don\u2019t really tune in when you hear that diagnosis,\" said Lowright. \"It\u2019s the ultimate devastation.\"\n\nShe refused to crawl into a corner and cry. Within a day, she was back sitting in front of the doctor\u2019s office, this time with her parents, her husband and her husband\u2019s parents.\n\n\"As a patient, you\u2019re not gonna remember every question to ask,\" Lowright said, who encourages others to bring family or friends, as they will likely ask questions the patient might forget to ask.\n\nSurgery was scheduled for December 2008, and Lowright elected to have both her breasts removed due to her age, the size of the tumor and the likelihood of the cancer returning.\n\nAlong the journey of second opinions and multiple meetings, one of her doctors recommended she speak with a reproductive doctor.\n\n\"I would never have thought about that,\" admitted Lowright.\n\nSome cancer treatments, like the one Lowright faced, can leave cancer victims without the ability to conceive or can launch young women into menopause early. But her army of doctors only had a short window after surgery \u2013 she needed to start chemo as fast as possible.\n\n\n\nThree to four weeks later, Lowright and her husband, who had met in high school and reconnected years later in their 30s, had nine embryos successfully frozen, ready and waiting for when Lowright would be cancer-free.\n\nShe thought losing her breasts would be hard, but that was nothing compared to when she started chemo. Within days, her hair was falling out.\n\n\"Emotionally, when you go to take a shower and you have no hair to wash and no body to shave, it\u2019s like, 'What do I do with myself?' One minute shower and I\u2019m done,\" said Lowright, laughing.\n\n\"The chemo took it all,\" she began, more reserved now.\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t like I had a lavish hairstyle, but it\u2019s how you identify yourself,\" she said.\n\nRadiation came next, following by a regiment of chemo in pill form and five years of another cancer drug. Meanwhile, her sister-in-law and mother were both diagnosed with breast cancer, something Lowright to this day still can\u2019t believe.\n\nFinally, in 2015, her doctors gave her the all-clear to start building a family.\n\n\n\n\"Jennifer is an incredibly strong and resilient woman that endured a nine year journey to motherhood,\" Dr. Allison Rodgers, Jennifer\u2019s reproductive endocrinologist from Fertility Centers of Illinois, told ABC News.\n\n\"By being proactive and preserving her fertility before undergoing breast cancer treatment she was able to ensure a chance at motherhood after her recovery. She is truly a survivor and an inspiration to those who want to have a family.\"\n\n\n\nIt took four treatments and all nine embryos, but in 2017, two weeks after Mothers\u2019 Day and at 42 years old, Lowright became pregnant.\n\n\"It\u2019s really tough to keep a positive outlook,\" said Lowright, noting that every woman who\u2019s pregnant faces anxiety.\n\n\"Every bloodwork, and then you wait for the call. Every ultrasound, and then [you listen for] a heartbeat,\" she added, remembering the anxiety-filled days of pregnancy vividly. To battle them, she went to a chiropractor, an acupuncturist, a massage therapist. Anything to keep herself calm.\n\nAnd then her husband Chris passed away unexpectedly, just months before their \"miracle\" daughter was born in January. Throughout it all, though, she kept up her positive outlook on life, knowing her late husband was particularly excited about having a girl.\n\n\"She\u2019s my little piece of heaven,\" explained Lowright.\n\n\"She\u2019s also identical [to him] ... the spitting image of him. She\u2019s all Chris,\" she added.\n\nLowright hopes that her story will speak to women and encourage them to realize they not only have options, but there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel too.\n\n\"You gotta believe its gonna work and you gotta believe you\u2019re gonna come through it,\" she said.\n\n\"You cannot go in with a negative attitude. It\u2019s not gonna work if you do that\u2026 Positive mental attitude is an essential ingredient in the formula.\"\n\n\n"}
