I is the negro Andrew Gillum and I'll be askin\u2019 you to make me governor of this here state of Florida,\" the voice says.\n\n\n\nIf Gillum wins the race against Republican and Trump-supported Rep. Ron DeSantis, he would be the state's first black governor.\n\n\n\nDeSantis denounced the latest calls at an Orlando campaign event on Tuesday, saying \"It's disgusting,\" and that the media should \u201cinvestigate who\u2019s doing that. I want to know who\u2019s doing that. I can tell you, we\u2019re not doing it. And I think the people who are doing it I think are doing it because they\u2019re trying to create division and I want to know who\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\n\n\nGillum responded Wednesday by accusing DeSantis of \"making excuses.\"\n\nHe cited a white nationalist video podcast, Road to Power, based in Idaho, reportedly behind other racist robocalls mocking California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. At the end of the robocall, a voice says Road to Power paid for it.\n\n\"Yesterday, Ron DeSantis and his campaign tried to make excuses for disgusting robocalls from an Idaho white supremacist group,\" Gillum said in a statement. \"Despite Road to Power being clearly identified in the call and widely identified in the press since August, DeSantis said he didn\u2019t know who the callers were, but that he thought \u201cthere\u2019s a method behind it\u201d and they were \u201ctrying to distract.\u201d"}
