{"id": "Trans Teen Jazz Jennings Refuses To Let The Trump Administration Tell Her Who She IsGet breaking news alerts", "paragraph": "When a recent memo was revealed exposing the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to begin strictly defining gender, LGBTQ advocates and allies around the country decried its apparent intent to erase transgender people.But for activists like Jazz Jennings, the 18-year-old star of TLC\u2019s reality show \u201cI Am Jazz,\u201d the threat of erasure is far from new. Long before networks began chronicling her life and tracing her every step, Jennings, a trans woman, was a relatively obscure trailblazer at her elementary school in South Florida.Jennings began living as her authentic self at age 5, and with the aid of her parents, she asserted her identity as a girl while demanding her school treat her as one. Jennings has since ascended into a role as one of the nation\u2019s foremost trans activists, and in a recent video posted to her popular YouTube channel, she defiantly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s memo.Jennings discussed the memo and its implications further in a follow-up interview with HuffPost. She also spoke of her beginnings as an activist, her approach to trans activism under the Trump administration and whether there is room for optimism in such a bleak period for the trans community.You\u2019ve long been politically inclined and politically active. What was your first instinct when hearing about the Trump administration\u2019s anti-trans memo? How do you craft a response to someone who\u2019s literally making a claim that you don\u2019t exist?I just sighed right away. It feels like the Trump administration keeps saying one thing after another, and this was a tipping point for me. I was over it, you know? My community \u2014 the transgender community \u2014 has already experienced victimization and been vulnerable in so many ways, and now the government is here trying to come after us directly. We don\u2019t need that extra discrimination; we don\u2019t need the government going against us when we already have society telling us we can\u2019t be who we are. So if anything, we need more support \u2014 more administrative and legal action on our side \u2015 and the opposite is happening. It\u2019s annoying.Has your method of engagement as an activist changed under the Trump administration, which carries more outright disdain for the trans community than the previous administration?My only focus is on love and support. I\u2019m not gonna give my attention to the Trump administration and people who are not supportive of the transgender community. Instead, I\u2019m trying to speak with others out there and tell them not to be afraid of being who they are. I tell them not to worry. The government doesn\u2019t have power over you \u2015 people have power over the government. And you\u2019re the people. So you be you, and be free, and be who you are, and don\u2019t let anyone undermine that, even if the government isn\u2019t on your side. So that\u2019s the focus of my advocacy: the love and the uplift.This does seem to be a particular type of discrimination. I\u2019m a black man, for example, and when I speak on my own behalf, it\u2019s not usually in response to people who don\u2019t believe black people exist. Do you think the playbook for trans activism is different because of the particular difficulty you face in being recognized for who you are?Yeah, I just think people don\u2019t really listen. They\u2019re so affirmed in their own beliefs that they won\u2019t hear anyone else out. And I think so many individuals don\u2019t understand the difference between biological sex and gender. They think because you\u2019re born a certain way that your biological sex determines who you are, but I and so many others are saying, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not just what\u2019s between your legs. Your chromosomes don\u2019t think and feel. Your heart, your mind, your body thinks and feels.\u201d I\u2019m saying I\u2019m a girl \u2014 I\u2019ve been a girl my entire life, and even though I was born biologically male, that doesn\u2019t mean anything when I\u2019m declaring that my happiness would be by identifying as a woman. People should allow me to be happy, and people should allow other transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals to be happy, and it shouldn\u2019t be a matter of concern.I saw that you recently celebrated your 18th birthday. How did you celebrate? Did you find yourself reflecting, at all, on the things you\u2019ve accomplished during your brief but eventful time on this earth?Well, 18 is obviously a big number, so even though it\u2019s just another year, it kind of isn\u2019t, because now I\u2019m officially an adult. And that\u2019s definitely changed my perspective in many ways. Now I feel as if I\u2019m coming into my own and stepping into my power, but I think everyone else is helping me realize my strength also. So it\u2019s been amazing because I\u2019ve been getting more freedom and independence as I\u2019ve approached adulthood. My family has been supporting me and allowing me to do more and more for myself in my life, so it\u2019s been a big number for me. And I can vote!We\u2019re often told that the millennial generation is the most progressive, and that when millennials come into power politically, all these divisions we see along racial lines and the gender lines we\u2019ve created will disappear. As a millennial activist, do you think that optimism is warranted?Yes, [I] definitely think it is. I think as time goes by, things always get better. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s just going to be millennials, though. I think we\u2019re going to show the world a different way of thinking about what it means to be a human being, which means you can be whoever you are regardless of the color of your skin, your religion, gender identity, sexual orientation \u2014 any of those things. You\u2019re just a person. And I\u2019m hoping that we can kind of adopt a new collective consciousness where we\u2019re here to help one another, and uplift one another, and focus on diversity and inclusion rather than separating each other and creating all these divisions and lines among us.I have faith that my generation will bring some of that to light, and the rest of the world is going to be on board with it. I think older generations are gonna be like, \u201cYeah, it should be this way.\u201d I think they\u2019ll be supportive of us, and I think that\u2019s happening right now.You\u2019ve been immersed in this battle for years, and I wonder whether you ever feel any fatigue.I mean, definitely. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time and it\u2019s hard being in the spotlight. It\u2019s hard saying the same message over and over again, because you just wonder when people are gonna open their minds and hear it. And I think people are hearing it, and that\u2019s what motivates me to continue sharing my story, because I know that with each and every project I work on, at least one person is going to hear it and it\u2019s going to affect their life in some way. And they\u2019re going to use that knowledge to change their life and the lives of people around them. Having that impact has been such a powerful thing, and I\u2019ve been blessed to have this position and platform to be able to share my story.Who are some of your inspirations when it comes to activism? Are there any people you model yourself after?There are so many incredible activists and leaders throughout history. I think the one that pertains to me most is Laverne Cox. She\u2019s obviously such an incredible and powerful leader. I was watching her on the news, thinking, \u201cWow, if I can help people the way Laverne helps people, that\u2019d be incredible.\u201d She\u2019s been doing it for so many years and I\u2019ve been doing it for so many years. Seeing her grow and seeing myself grow, and seeing us able to create some change in this world, has been amazing.What do you think advocates of the trans community can do to help in response to the memo?Speaking out and using your voice is the most important thing \u2014 in any format possible. Whether it\u2019s a simple thing and you\u2019re speaking to a small group of people, or you\u2019re speaking to a large audience, you sharing your story makes a difference. I really want this to be a community effort. Advocates can continue to do things, appear in the news, speak to news outlets, post on social media \u2014 so many things. And I think everyone has to play a role in their own special way.\u201cI Am Jazz\u201d is set to air its fifth season on TLC in 2019.\u00a0"}
