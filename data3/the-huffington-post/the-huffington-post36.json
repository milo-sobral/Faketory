He could not provide further details or official estimates of casualties.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of damage and destruction,\u201d Sablan said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a small war just passed through.\u201dSablan said the entire island sustained damage, but there are areas that are worse than others. He has not been able to reach officials on the territory\u2019s neighbor islands of Tinian and Rota because phones and electricity are out.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take weeks probably to get electricity back to everybody,\u201d he said.Sablan says colleagues in Congress have reached out to offer help. He expects there will be a presidential disaster declaration put in place.\u201cWe\u2019re surviving, we\u2019ll get through this \u2014 we are a resilient people \u2014 but it\u2019s just huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need America\u2019s prayers, and we need help, and I don\u2019t doubt that we will get help. Thank you, America, for always being there for us.\u201dThe Governor\u2019s team is working to open additional shelters as most of the existing shelters are either at capacity or sustained damage which prevents them from taking in more residents.#SuperTyphoonYutu #TyphoonYutu #Yutu #Marianas #CNMI.@fema was asked to bring in commodities to support ongoing shelter operations and it appears they will arrive tomorrow.#SuperTyphoonYutu #TyphoonYutu #Yutu #Marianas #CNMINearly 200 federal emergency workers were in the Marianas to assist, Sablan said.Maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (290 kph) were recorded around the eye of the storm, which passed over Tinian and Saipan early Thursday local time, said Brandon Aydlett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.Tinian suffered a direct hit. Saipan and Tinian will be unrecognizable, Aydlett said, adding that the weather service received reports that Yutu\u2019s catastrophic winds ripped roofs from homes and blew out windows.\u201cAny debris becomes shrapnel and deadly,\u201d he said.Northern Marianas brace for slow recovery after typhoon - Super Typhoon Yutu crossed over the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands early Thursday in what the National Weather Service said was the strongest storm to hit any part of the United States this year... pic.twitter.com/SgzcirG9xUFallen trees could isolate residents, and power and water outages could last weeks, the weather service warned.\u201cAt its peak, the wind was constant and the sound horrifying,\u201d Glen Hunter wrote in a Facebook message to The Associated Press. Hunter lives on Saipan, the largest island in the commonwealth, which is a U.S. territory about 3,800 miles west of Hawaii.\u201cGonna be quite a scene when the sun comes up,\u201d Hunter wrote to the AP early Thursday.It was still quite dark when he peeked outside and saw his neighbor\u2019s house, made of wood and tin, completely gone. A palm tree was uprooted.Hunter, 45, has lived on Saipan since childhood and is accustomed to strong storms. \u201cWe are in typhoon alley,\u201d he wrote, but added this is the worst he has experienced.Check out the eye of Super Typhoon #Yutu in the western Pacific, seen today from #Himawari-8. The ferocious Category 5 storm is packing 180 mph winds and quickly approaching the U.S. territories of Saipan, Tinian and Rota.

All government offices and schools shut down two days ago. A few gas stations ran out of gas by Tuesday evening, he said.\u201cWe knew it was going to be big,\u201d he said, \u201cbut wow.\u201dThe roof flew off the second floor of Del Benson\u2019s Saipan home.\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep much,\u201d he wrote to the AP in a Facebook message. \u201cI went upstairs and the skylight blew out. Then the roof started to go. We got the kids downstairs.\u201dRecovery efforts on Saipan and Tinian will be slow, Aydlett said. \u201cThis is the worst-case scenario. This is why the building codes in the Marianas are so tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be the storm which sets the scale for which future storms are compared to.\u201dSix of Saipan\u2019s 10 shelters were full, he wrote, and Tinian\u2019s shelter was full.All ports were closed, and flights into the Northern Marianas were canceled, he wrote.\u201cThe Tinian Medical Center sustained extensive damage. Fortunately, no patients were present,\u201d he wrote in a post that also said the Commonwealth Healthcare Center and Rota Medical Center were running on generator power.The emergency operations center was having phone connectivity issues, Sablan tweeted later in the day. Cellphone and landline service was spotty in Saipan.Dean Sensui, vice chair for Hawaii on the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, was in Saipan for a council meeting. He hunkered down in his hotel room, where guests were told to remain indoors because winds were still strong Thursday morning.\u201cFrom around midnight the wind could be heard whipping by,\u201d he said in a Facebook message. \u201cDown at the restaurant it sounded like a Hollywood soundtrack with the intense rain and howling wind.\u201dBecause he\u2019s in a solid hotel, it wasn\u2019t as scary as living through Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which left the Hawaiian island of Kauai badly damaged, he said. \u201cThe fact that we still have Internet access proves how solid their infrastructure is,\u201d he said. \u201cHawaii and others should study the Marianas to understand how to design and build communication grids that can withstand a storm.\u201dThe Northern Marianas have a population of about 55,000 people.Waves of 25 to 40 feet were expected around the eye of the storm, and flooding is likely, forecasters said.A typhoon warning was in effect for Saipan, Tinian and Rota. A tropical storm warning was in place for Guam and other southern islands."}
