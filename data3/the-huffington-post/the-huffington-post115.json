{"id": "Planning My Wedding Is Making Me Feel Like I've Stepped Back 50 YearsGet breaking news alerts", "paragraph": "When I got engaged last year, I expected wedding planning to be fun, if a little stressful in parts, and mostly very expensive. What I didn\u2019t expect was how uncomfortable it would make me feel, and how outdated the wedding industry is.It started immediately upon announcing our engagement. My fianc\u00e9 proposed at Disney World, and I went back to work to find a queue of women at my desk. The questions started. \u201cDid you know he was going to ask? Were you surprised? Did you cry?\u201d I admitted that yes, I knew he was going to ask, and no, I didn\u2019t cry. At all. In fact, I had a fit of the giggles. My answers were met with polite but disappointed faces. After all, as these women told me, I\u2019d just experienced \u201cevery girl\u2019s dream.\u201d My Mum found that people wished to congratulate her, too, as though she had done an excellent job in selecting for her only daughter a single man of good fortune, who was in want of a wife. In reality, my Mum is as unromantic as I am, and was pleased but not especially overwhelmed.When the novelty of my new status wore off, I was relieved. Maybe I\u2019d be left alone now to get on with planning my wedding in peace. Not so. The whole process seemed to be set 50 years in the past. Having a ring on a particular finger apparently told people things about me, and those people expected me to be a woman I am very much not. The sort of woman who was interested in napkins, silverware and making my husband\u2019s dinner. Some highlights of venue hunting included wedding coordinators who spoke only to me as though my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t even there (because as a man, he doesn\u2019t actually care, apparently), one woman who advised me to \u201cmake sure he attends his suit appointments,\u201d and venue staff who were truly baffled by my lack of interest in chair sashes. They seemed to feel that my whole life had been leading up to this moment. \u00a0Every time I meet new people, the round of wedding quizzes begins again. Was I disappointed he hadn\u2019t dressed smartly to propose? Am I going to lose weight for the big day? Someone tells me on average once a week that they \u201ccan\u2019t believe I\u2019m not stressed.\u201d My wedding is over a year away, and people seem to be astonished that I can think of anything else. Wedding planning is not anywhere near as much as fun as I had hoped. Instead, I feel like I\u2019m bad at it, the wrong sort of bride, because I don\u2019t want a particularly traditional wedding. But I\u2019m also not planning a pagan handfasting in the woods. I\u2019ve booked a nice hotel wedding venue, and my Dad will walk me down the aisle. But I\u2019m also comfortably ditching any tradition that doesn\u2019t appeal to me. I won\u2019t be throwing the bouquet, and the idea of me promising to honor and obey made my fianc\u00e9 laugh so much he nearly hyperventilated. This choice seems to confuse well-meaning acquaintances immensely, and somehow my wedding is \u201cincorrect.\u201d I\u2019ve felt this from the start, with reactions to my purple sapphire engagement ring, which is often declared \u201cunusual,\u201d or my personal favorite from my Nan, \u201cvery large.\u201d I\u2019ve been told they \u201ccan\u2019t picture me getting married in a hotel,\u201d which is very comforting to hear when that\u2019s the venue I\u2019ve booked. The groom is incorrect,\u00a0too, because he has an opinion about his own wedding.My feelings of inadequacy at this bridal business are helped along by the fact my entire identity seems to revolve around it now. People refer me to as \u201cthe future Mrs. Whitney,\u201d which makes me want to jab them in the eyes with a fork, especially as I\u2019m going to combine our names and be Elsmere-Whitney. I\u2019ll also keep using Ms. My fianc\u00e9 is also planning to use both names, but that\u2019s a whole other story of baffled reactions. People ask me how wedding planning is going before they ask me how I am. They look pitying when I don\u2019t have anything new to tell them.Thank God for sensible friends and family who ask how it\u2019s going, but don\u2019t forget I have a personality outside of \u201cbride,\u201d or I think I\u2019d have gone on a murdering spree. I can\u2019t wait to be married to my best friend, and make our team official. But also, I can\u2019t wait to be married so I can stop feeling like a crap bride, or as though I\u2019ve accidentally time-traveled to 1955. I\u2019ll be gritting my teeth until it\u2019s over. And then after that, I expect I can look forward to being interviewed about my breeding plans.Do you have a compelling personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?\u00a0Find out what we\u2019re looking for\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0send us a pitch!"}
