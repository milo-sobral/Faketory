The company was responsible for the search for the missing vessel and was commissioned by the Argentine government.The discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a commemoration one year after the sub disappeared on Nov. 15, 2017.On Thursday, on the anniversary of the disappearance, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \u201cabsolute and non-negotiable commitment\u201d to find \u201cthe truth.\u201dMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.Argentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but the navy has continued searching for the vessel.The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.The navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub\u2019s batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.Some hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \u201cconcentration of hydrogen\u201d triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain."}
