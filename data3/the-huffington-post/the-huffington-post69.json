People who claim to be Christian, wholeheartedly practicing their politics \u201cin the name of God,\u201d have wholly abandoned the way of Jesus who tells us from the beginning to care first for the poor, marginalized and downtrodden. The question posed by this week\u2019s midterm elections is yet again: Will Christians continue to compromise the way of Jesus in favor of perpetuating a Christian subculture obsessed with power \u2015 and the delusion that Trump\u2019s presidency is a direct result of God\u2019s will? Or will they break free of that trap?As of 2017, 91 percent of Congress identified as Christian, and while this is a vague moniker in many ways, it is notably both unrepresentative of the total population (where three-fourths identify as Christian) and consistent with Christianity\u2019s overrepresentation in politics throughout the history of United States.Christians frequently call on the history of Christianity of the \u201cfounding fathers\u201d to back-up the authority of their politics in the U.S. without recognizing the inherently unchristian values that some of those founders held. From having affairs and using violence as a primary tool (most of them) to literally cutting and pasting the scriptures to create a religious ideology (Jefferson), the foundation of U.S. politics was laid on compromising the ways of Jesus in exchange for power. This same compromise was made to justify slavery, genocide of indigenous people and massive land theft and is the foundation of how Christians interact with the political system.The equation is actually quite simple: Christians\u2019 (particularly Christian leaders) perception of moral authority, plus a contextual and universalized interpretation of the Bible, and the false notion that God ordained the U.S. to be a Christian nation, manifests in a spiritual rhetoric that backs up all power and violence as a means to an end for a Christian reality. This is a dangerous pattern present in American Christianity where those in power, believing that God is in control, create realities where their way is done and then call it God\u2019s plan. God\u2019s plan somehow always seems to agree with political agendas in this logical tail chasing.\u00a0It shouldn\u2019t be this way.As Christians align ourselves with political parties, the key question becomes, \u201cWho and what would Jesus align himself with?\u201d Even a quick look at just the first few chapters of each of the gospels reveals a God that is less interested in moral purity or political power (which in the story Satan offers), and more interested in both embodying the experience of the marginalized and calling the poor, meek, hungry, merciful, pure in heart, persecuted and peacemakers to follow him in an upside down way of being. In Jesus\u2019 way, God\u2019s closeness has nothing to do with power and everything to do with alleviating suffering and siding with the concerns of the downtrodden.Christians in the U.S. would rather talk about a fallacious war on Christianity in order to recast themselves as the persecuted. The spiritual gymnastics required to fit ourselves into the role of the people who Jesus sided with his asinine.There is not a lot in scripture that is clear \u2015 and it only ends up clear if we make a ton of assumptions. One thing that is clear, however, is that Jesus, when summing up the law, says that it\u2019s about loving God and loving people \u2015 not institutionalizing God and subjugating people.It turns out, what Christians often perceive as a commitment to scripture is more specifically a commitment to Christian power. If the lens of politics comes first, it is not hard to justify a whole range of positions with scripture. It is how people like Attorney General Jeff Sessions can use scripture out of context\u00a0one day to justify separating migrant children from their parents, but then ignore and kick out pastors who quote scripture back to him.The psychology of victimhood allows them to claim that any critique of their Christianity is part of the effort to \u201cerode our great tradition of religious freedom.\u201d Theirs is a Christianity that, putting itself at the center, cannot see how its policies impact those who don\u2019t share its interests.Christian political rhetoric, and by extension voting, largely centers on \u201ctaking a stand\u201d against things that seem unchristian, but seem inherently disinterested in living out the way of Jesus. In the modern Republican party, this is most clear around abortion, where it is notable that anti-choice policy, while seen as \u201ctaking a stand,\u201d doesn\u2019t actually decrease abortions. The issue functions purely as a source of performative moral outrage that eliminates Christians\u2019 capacity for nuanced, educated, responsible and holistic voting. Morality and ethics are not absolute and scripture doesn\u2019t treat them like they are \u2015 the Bible is full of God not telling people what to do specifically, them doing super messed up stuff and scripture seemingly remaining indifferent. What is notable are the things that do seem to be constants \u2015 love for God and sacrificial love for others regardless of identity.At the end of the day, if we opt into politics that deeply humanize people regardless of identity, we enter into the story of the people Jesus aligned himself with.History doesn\u2019t typically look back fondly on those who attempt to \u201cconserve\u201d traditional ways, and scripture doesn\u2019t expect that culture will always look the same. The cultural values of Jesus\u2019 time do not line up with ours, so the values must be understood contextually, not just at face value. In the choice in partisan politics between flawed candidates on all sides, Christians\u2019 engagement with politics ought not just mean unquestioningly supporting candidates like Trump who promise them seats at the table of power, but to call all politicians to higher standards of the common good.\u00a0We must be educated voters and political actors, choosing not based on single issues or partisan politics, but by looking at candidates and their overall impacts more consciously. \u00a0It is our responsibility to emulate Christ and not the people who have distorted him to their own purpose.Jesus didn\u2019t use his name to gain political power. We ought to be careful with our own temptation to do so.Brandi Miller is a campus minister and justice program director from the Pacific Northwest. "}
