{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Ten companies controlled half of the health care industry's $50 billion of global profit in the third quarter of this year, according to an analysis of financial documents for 112 publicly traded health care corporations. Nine of those 10 companies at the top are pharmaceutical firms.The bottom line: Americans spend a lot more money on hospital and physician care than prescription drugs, but pharmaceutical companies pocket a lot more than other parts of the industry.By the numbers: The health care industry's $50 billion of profit came from $636 billion of revenue, equating to a cumulative profit margin of almost 8%. Those are the highest figures of the past four quarters.Between the lines: The Republican tax law, which slashed the corporate tax rate, also continues to bolster the industry.The big picture: The health care industry arguably has more financial power now than at any point in its history, and a split Congress likely won't change that in the short term \u2014 even though patients are fed up with the system.
