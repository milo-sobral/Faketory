Midterms are a week from today. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Nov. 11 \u2014 two Sundays from now \u2014 marks 100 years since World War I ended, the N.Y. Times Magazine reminds us. More than 4 million Americans served.President Trump plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil, he said yesterday in an exclusive interview for \"Axios on HBO,\"\u00a0a new four-part documentary news series debuting on HBO this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET/PT. See the video in the Axios stream. Media must credit \"Axios on HBO.\"Trump told Swan and Axios CEO Jim VandeHei that he has run the idea of ending birthright citizenship by his counsel and plans to proceed with the highly controversial move, which certainly will face legal challenges.When Swan says that's very much in dispute, Trump replied: \"You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order.\"The president expressed surprise that Swan knew about his secret plan: \"I didn't think anybody knew that but me. I thought I was the only one.\" The legal challenges would force the courts to decide on a constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment, which says: Be smart: Few immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president's power to change birthright citizenship, former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel Lynden Melmed tells Axios. Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, recently took up this argument in the Washington Post.Between the lines: Until the 1960s, the 14th Amendment was never applied to undocumented or temporary immigrants, Eastman said. The bottom line: If Trump follows through on the executive order, \"the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven't,\" Eastman said. During an interview with Bob Woodward and Bob Costa in April 2016, candidate Donald Trump said when asked if he needed to tame the rage in the Republican Party: CNN's Jake Tapper surfaced that quote yesterday during an interview with Woodward, who said: \"We know presidents have extraordinary power,\" Woodward continued. \"He has probably more power than any president I've reported on, going back to Nixon. And he has seized it with the communication channel \u2014 with the tweeting, and the rallies and the press conferences.\"\"Until recent years, many Jews in America believed that the worst of anti-Semitism was over there, in Europe, a vestige of the old country,\" the N.Y.
