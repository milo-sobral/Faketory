{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Bina48, the first-ever robot to complete a college course, finished another mission today: It became the first robot to co-teach a university-level class.Why it matters: The experiment at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point sought to determine if AI can \"support a liberal education model,\" says William Barry, a West Point professor who has been using Bina48 to teach for years.What\u2019s happening: Bina48 co-taught two sessions of an introduction to ethics philosophy course \u2014 which covers ethical reasoning, just-war theory and the use of artificial intelligence in society. In the classroom were almost 100 students, along with Barry and Maj. Scott Parsons, an assistant professor at West Point.The objective was to understand whether AI \u201ccan authentically support teaching in the classroom, where it enhances students\u2019 comprehension and holds interest,\" Barry says.How it works: Bina48 is fed a mosaic of general knowledge, in the form of what Barry calls \"mind files.\"After today\u2019s class, Barry tells Axios the cadets were wholly receptive:But the bot may not be best suited for West Point, the cadets concluded, since it didn\u2019t quite keep pace with the class. It might make a greater impact in countries with low literacy rates, he says.Flashback: This is not Bina48's first interaction with West Point students. Last year, it participated in a\u00a0debate about the use of\u00a0nonlethal weapons in warfare."}
