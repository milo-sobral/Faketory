{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "More than 100 S&P 500 companies will report quarterly results this week, but Apple and Facebook are the headliners.Why it matters: Tech companies' good results have not been good enough for investors, as we saw with Alphabet and Amazon this week. Apple and Facebook could further drag tech sentiment down, or turn the tide.Apple, the world's most valuable public company, is expected to report strong results thanks to a boost in the \"average selling price\" metric from pricier phones, not necessarily more iPhones sold.Facebook gave dismal guidance for the rest of 2018 back in July, so expectations for this quarter are low.What else to watch: Alibaba will also report, along with General Motors, General Electric and Starbucks. Plus the big oil companies will release quarterly results."}
