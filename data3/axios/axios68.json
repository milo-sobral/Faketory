{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon has acquired Fortune magazine for $150 million, in just the latest example of a U.S. business publication ending up in the hands of an East Asian buyer.Be smart: The day might not be that far off when there are no major American-owned business publications at all. Even Business Insider is German.The similar moves in the space:Tech-rich Americans are perhaps more likely to just funnel money in the general direction of journalists, rather than buying trophies.The bottom line: Journalists tend to have mixed feelings when their publications are bought for nine-figure sums. On the one hand, it's a vote of confidence in their work and a sign that it's valuable. On the other hand, the money is going to sellers, not journalists. If the buyers expect a decent return on their investment, then the higher the purchase price, the bigger the un-reinvested dividends the new owner might demand."}
