{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "SAP on Sunday night announced that it will purchase Qualtrics, a U.S.-based maker of survey software that had been expected to go public this week, for $8 billion in cash,Why it matters: This would be the largest-ever purchase of a VC-backed enterprise software company, and the third-largest sale of any SaaS company (behind Oracle buying Netsuite for $9.3 billion, and SAP buying Concur for $8.3 billion).SAP CEO Bill McDermott said in a conference call that the Qualtrics IPO was already over-subscribed, and that this deal will be as transformative for SAP as buying Instagram was for Facebook \u2014 with SAP being able to merge its massive trove of operational data with Qualtrics' collection of user experience data.He also says discussions between the two companies have been ongoing for just a few months.This is the second time this year that a \"unicorn\" enterprise software company has been purchased just before its planned IPO. The first was Workday buying Adaptive Insights."}
