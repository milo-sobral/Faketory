{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "America is an increasingly diverse nation but a loud, hyper-active group of well-to-do whites on the left and right are tearing it apart from the edges, according to an astonishing new study of our electorate.The big picture: 14% of America, roughly half left and half right, consistently shouts, posts and votes, while 67% of us are exhausted.This eye-opening breakdown comes from \"Hidden Tribes: A Study of America\u2019s Polarized Landscape,\" by the international nonprofit group More in Common.The study finds that America's two extreme wings comprise just 14% of the population, \"yet it often feels as if our national conversation has become a shouting match between these two groups.\"I interviewed one of the study's co-authors, Stephen Hawkins, research director of More in Common USA, who told me the two wings are \"talking to each other too little, with too much suspicion and too little giving credit.\"Be smart ... Good news for third-party dreamers: Tw0-thirds of Americans (the study's \"Exhausted Majority\") have had it with this white fight \u2014 and yearn for something new."}
