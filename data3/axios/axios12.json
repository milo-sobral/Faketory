{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Today's tech industry is hurting people and strong regulations are needed to protect user privacy, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a speech in Brussels on Wednesday.Details: As promised, Cook praised Europe for passing its GDPR protections. He also called on the U.S. to enact \"a comprehensive federal privacy law\" consisting of at least 4 key planks:Cook also took aim at the companies that are profiting off the collection of user information, calling it a \"data industrial complex.\" He warned of the privacy implications of mass data collection, and criticized tech and government leaders who downplay tech's negative impact on society.Key quotes:\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency. ... Taken to its extreme, this process creates an enduring digital profile that lets companies know you better than you may know yourself.\"\"Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false. This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or 'crazy.'\"\"If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound. ... We can achieve both great artificial intelligence and great privacy standards. It\u2019s not only a possibility, it is a responsibility. In the pursuit of artificial intelligence, we should not sacrifice the humanity, creativity, and ingenuity that define our human intelligence.\"Yes, but: The \u201cdata industrial complex\u201d Cook refers to pays for much of the modern internet, helping Google, Facebook, and many other companies target ads and keep their services free.The bottom line: Supporters of meaningful privacy regulations can count on Apple's backing, as the company continues to try to stand apart from other tech giants, particularly Google and Facebook."}
