{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell six times for raising interest rates.Flashback: Nearly one year ago, Trump struck a very different tone when nominating Powell:What's changed since then is that the Fed hiked interest rates, but Trump had to see it coming. Then-candidate Trump criticized prior Fed chair Janet Yellen for not raising rates.The bottom line: Trump does not plan to stop criticizing Powell, as Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan reported, but he's walking into a lose-lose. Either the Fed will continue to raise rates, thus reaffirming its independence from the White House, or it will slow those raises because it believes the economy is slowing down."}
