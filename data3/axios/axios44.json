{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "As the fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi continues to roil global relations, American consulting firms McKinsey & Company, Booz Allen Hamilton and Boston Consulting Group have stuck by the Saudi government, thanks in large part to a set of broad, lucrative business contracts that stretch back to at least 2010, reports the New York Times.The big picture: The three firms played critical roles in bolstering the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose global PR blitz in 2017 earned him a reputation as a \"reformer\" \u2014 a label that is now under serious question. They've also taken on more \"unconventional assignments\" in their multimillion-dollar engagements with the kingdom, including training the Saudi navy as it upholds a blockade in Yemen, advising government ministries and \u2014 in at least one case \u2014 identifying the royal family's most prominent online critics."}
