But despite critics' warnings about the end of private insurance or a government takeover of health care, the law has not upended the system's underlying structure or stifled the industry's ability to reap large profits.By the numbers: The S&P 500 health care index, which tracks the stocks of 63 major companies, has soared by 186% since the ACA became law. By comparison, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones increased by 141% and 139%, respectively, according to FactSet.Winners: Health insurers. The stock price of Centene, a major Medicaid and ACA marketplace insurer, has multiplied by 12 times or 1,100%. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have jumped by more than 700%. The rest of the industry \u2014 which helped craft the law through intensive lobbying \u2014 has benefited, too.Go deeper: The ACA boom has helped pad the wallets of health care leaders."}
