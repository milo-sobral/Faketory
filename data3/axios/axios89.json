{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "The United States has not signed the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a pact between 51 countries and hundreds of the important companies in tech, nonprofits and universities. At least, not yet. The big picture: Signatories tell Axios that the U.S. hasn't shut the door on the agreement of general principles for internet security. The agreement, a first-of-its-kind document involving both the public and private sector, could be a significant step toward a global understanding of what countries are and aren't permitted to do online \u2014 but that's likely only if the U.S. lends its heft. What they're saying: \"It is a missed opportunity for the U.S., especially because the agreement is nonbinding,\" Peter Singer, a strategist and senior fellow at the New America Foundation, told Codebook via email. The Paris Call is a handshake establishing principles, including: Other odds and ends: It also stipulates:Who didn't sign: The U.S. is not the only nation that didn't sign the Paris Call. But many of the other nonsignatories skew in an unflattering direction: They include North Korea, Russia, Iran and China. The intrigue: The United States appears to have two motivations not to sign.1. Trump hates these things. President Trump likes deals, not agreements. He likes bilateral, transactional things where he feels like the U.S. comes out ahead. This is more of a zero-sum affair, where everyone in the world benefits because everyone gives something up. 2. Big dogs don't like fences. And nearly all the major cyber powers (U.S., North Korea, China, Iran, Russia and Israel) stayed out of the agreement, likely hesitant to place even nonbinding restrictions on how they act. One exception is the United Kingdom, who signed the agreement. "}
