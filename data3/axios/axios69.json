{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "House Democrats plan to investigate whether President Trump abused White House power by targeting \u2014 and trying to punish with \"instruments of state power\" \u2014 the Washington Post and CNN, incoming House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said in an interview for \"Axios on HBO.\"Why it matters: Until now, all Trump critics could do is complain about his escalating attacks on the media. With subpoena power and public hearings, the incoming House Democratic majority can demand emails and testimony to see if Trump used \u201cthe instruments of state power to punish the press,\u201d Schiff said.\u00a0\u201cIt is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,\u201d he said in the interview, which will air Sunday evening on HBO.\u00a0Schiff brought up two avenues of inquiry with press-freedom themes, aimed at investigating possible administration actions targeting two of the nation's highest profile corporations.1) Schiff said Trump \"was secretly meeting with the postmaster [general] in an effort to browbeat the postmaster [general] into raising postal rates on Amazon.\"2) Schiff said Congress also needs to examine whether Trump attempted to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner as payback to CNN.Between the lines: Schiff\u2019s warning comes amid the tensest showdowns between the presidency and the press in our lifetimes. Trump, who calls much of the media \"the enemy of the people\" and \"fake news,\" this week took the extraordinary steps of revoking the press credentials of a CNN correspondent and berating another CNN correspondent for asking \"stupid\" questions.Be smart: Some senior White House officials were uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s fixation on his inaccurate belief Amazon was ripping off the U.S. Postal Service.Go deeper: The second episode of Axios on HBO airs Sunday evening at 6:30 pm ET/PT.\u00a0"}
