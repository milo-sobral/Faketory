{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "The U.S. National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee approved a report on Wednesday that calls for a new White House council for long-term cybersecurity.Why it matters: Lawmakers tend to legislate solutions to problems that impact the next election, but many cybersecurity issues \u2014 such as the impending chaos that will be caused by quantum computing and quantum encryption, as highlighted in the report \u2014 can't be handled on two-, four- or six-year cycles. Details: The report urges the White House to create an Apollo program-like effort called the Cybersecurity Moonshot, which would include a council (the Cybersecurity Moonshot Council) made up of Cabinet-level officials and an executive director to continuously provide cybersecurity guidance focused on meeting the demands of a decade in the future. What's next: It's unclear whether President Trump will act on the advice in the report."}
