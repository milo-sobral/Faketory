{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "The Republican tax law has rerouted billions of dollars from the federal treasury into the bank accounts of health care companies and Wall Street investors.By the numbers: These are some of the tax savings that have been calculated so far in 2018, according to my analysis of Q3 earnings reports.Details: These numbers were calculated by taking each company\u2019s effective tax rate from the first 9 months of 2017 and applying it toward operating profits in the first 9 months of 2018.The bottom line: Some companies have had similar or even higher tax bills this year compared with last year. But these 6 companies alone have reaped $2.6 billion from the lower corporate tax rate \u2014 a haul that has more than paid for any lobbying to get the law across the finish line."}
