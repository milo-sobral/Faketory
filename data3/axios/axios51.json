{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Cracks are beginning to show in a booming economy that's on pace for a 10th year of continuous growth.Why it matters:\u00a0There's plenty of good news \u2014 today's jobs report showed unemployment holding at a stunning 49-year low, for instance. But look closer, and visible threats suggest an all-out recession could come as soon as next year.Between the lines: Key economic indicators are flashing red. And U.S. economic growth is already slowing. In the third quarter, GDP growth retreated to a 3.5% annual rate, down from 4.2% the prior quarter. Going forward, economists expect growth to hit 2.9% in the fourth quarter, and 2.5% in the first quarter of 2019.The forecasts for what comes next are all over the map \u2014 but recession is a common theme. Another concern is the Fed's series of interest rate hikes, which are pushing up prices and, according to Greene, are a leading indicator of recession.   Among the experts forecasting a continuing slowdown going into 2020: the IMF, and Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, both former Fed heads.The other side: We're obsessed with knowing the timing of the next recession, and while the economy is slowing down, its growth is still healthy.The White House says it has no plans to revise its GDP forecast of 3.5% this year and a bit above 3% in 2019. Kevin Hassett, a top Trump economic adviser, told Axios that capital investment has rebounded since Trump's election, and that it will sustain growth. But there are signs that it is slowing. In the third quarter, business investment growth slowed to 0.8% from 8.5% in the second quarter, and 11.5% in the prior quarter.Correction: This story has been updated to note that the slowdown is in manufacturing activity for metal products, not all manufacturing."}
