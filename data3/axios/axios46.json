{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "President Trump walked back comments on Friday about the military engaging with migrants who throw rocks at them, saying there aren't plans to fire at people at the border, but to arrest them instead. The big picture: What Trump originally said about the military considering rocks \"a firearm because there's not much difference\" prompted backlash and questioning regarding the military's authorized use of force in similar situations. The military's rules allow its members to act in self-defense, but typically \"proportional\" to the hostility they're facing.An internal Pentagon memo obtained by the Washington Post says that troops are authorized to use deadly force in defense of \"all persons, foreign or domestic, who are faced with imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and where lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed.\"The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 restricts the U.S. military from acting as law enforcement on U.S. soil.CBP, however, appears to have slightly more leeway in what constitutes the application of deadly force. CBP did not initially respond to request for comment. "}
