{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "President Trump's trade war with China won't bring back the jobs lost from the trade deficit with China, according to Robert Scott, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, whose work Trump cited on the campaign trail and during his presidency.Why it matters: Here's an example of the trade debate's complexity. Some economists who agree with Trump that unfair trade has hurt U.S. workers don't think his tariff response will reverse the damage.U.S. jobs have been impacted, Scott says in a new report, because \"imports from China have soared while exports to China have increased much less.\u201d  In some regions of the U.S., the manufacturing sector is not growing as much as it could \u201cif new factories were opening and existing plants were hiring more workers,\u201d thanks to more production of goods in China, not the U.S.Trump campaigned on the promise to bring manufacturing jobs back. Considering jobs in this sector have been on the upswing, he may claim some success. But Scott told Axios that tariffs, which could potentially raise costs for factories, won't be the reason for total revival of the industry.The other side: Mark Perry, a scholar at conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, says factory jobs have been declining since the 1940s, way before China entered the WTO, and technology is to blame, not trade.
