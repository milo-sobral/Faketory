{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Cybersecurity is a growing problem in the United States, both as a domestic and international issue \u2014 but it's not one that brings people to the ballot box.The big picture: Candidates who want to make cybersecurity a priority in government can't make the case a centerpiece of an election campaign. The stakes are high. Here's how two House candidates with backgrounds in the cybersecurity field, one Democrat and one Republican, are handling the issue. \u201cHow do you think we\u2019re going to be attacked next?\u201d asks Tracy Mitrano, Democratic candidate for New York's 23rd Congressional District.Mitrano, a former director of information technology policy at in-district Cornell University, says that national cybersecurity is one of the key reasons she\u2019s running in 2016. It just can\u2019t be a key campaign issue. That's because, by Mitrano\u2019s stats, only 4% of her mostly rural district view cybersecurity as a top issue.Across the country, in San Antonio, a hub for the burgeoning cybersecurity industry, Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) says that he\u2019s asked once or twice at each town hall about cybersecurity.Hurd is known for his work in cybersecurity and federal IT issues. He is a rare lawmaker with a cybersecurity background, having been a senior advisor to the security firm FusionX.The bottom line: Both Hurd and Mitrano believe Congress lacks cybersecurity expertise. Neither think it's an issue someone can run on."}
