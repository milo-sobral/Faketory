{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "President Trump repeated his attack on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for raising interest rates in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Why it matters: Trump has put the Fed in a box \u2014 no matter what the central bank does, it will appear as though they aren\u2019t independent. If they don\u2019t raise rates, it will appear as if they've been influenced by the president. If they do hike, it will look like they are doing so simply for the appearance of independence."}
