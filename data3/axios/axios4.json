{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "A serious illness will often wipe out your life savings even if you have health insurance. That's the sobering conclusion from a new national survey of people who have had to rely on the health care system intensively.The big picture: \"You\u2019re kind of at a disadvantage as a consumer going against these big complicated systems that don\u2019t always have your best interest at heart,\" University of Michigan professor Sarah Miller told the New York Times, which helped analyze the survey. \"And I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much financial burden, even among people with private insurance.\"By the numbers, via the NYT:Making matters worse, 53% said their illness had kept them from working, at least temporarily. That may not be a direct health care cost \u2014 it's not money that goes into the health care system \u2014 but it's a big part of the toll that the system takes on the people who need it."}
