{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "President Trump plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on U.S. soil, he said yesterday in an exclusive interview for \"Axios on HBO,\"\u00a0a new four-part documentary news series debuting on HBO this Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET/PT. Why it matters: This would be the most dramatic move yet in Trump's hard-line immigration campaign, this time targeting \"anchor babies\" and \"chain migration.\" And it will set off another standoff with the courts, as Trump\u2019s power to do this through executive action is debatable, to say the least.[Get more stories like this in our daily morning newsletter, Axios AM.\u00a0Sign up here.]Trump told \"Axios on HBO\" that he has run the idea of ending birthright citizenship by his counsel and plans to proceed with the highly controversial move, which certainly will face legal challenges.The president expressed surprise that \"Axios on HBO\" knew about his secret plan: \"I didn't think anybody knew that but me. I thought I was the only one. \" The legal challenges would force the courts to decide on a constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment, which says: Be smart: Few immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president's power to change birthright citizenship, former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel Lynden Melmed tells Axios. Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, recently took up this argument in the Washington Post.Between the lines: Until the 1960s, the 14th Amendment was never applied to undocumented or temporary immigrants, Eastman said. The bottom line: If Trump follows through on the executive order, \"the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven't,\" Eastman said. The full interview will air on \"Axios on HBO\" this Sunday, Nov. 4, at 6:30 p.m. ET/PT.Go deeper:"}
