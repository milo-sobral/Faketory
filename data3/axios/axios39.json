{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "Neither cozying up to Kim Jong-un nor charging an alleged North Korean agent involved in the disastrous WannaCry malware fiasco has stopped Pyongyang from orchestrating digital bank heists. The best bet to stopping North Korea's misbehavior might be to start with petty crime.The big picture: North Korea relies on money from cyber crimes to compensate for sanctions. But they aren't all $81 million heists. \"North Korean hackers spend most of the day doing low-level crime \u2014 cheating at online poker, cracking video games, committing low-level financial crime. That's where most of the money comes from,\" said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at threat intelligence firm Recorded Future.Recorded Future released a new overview of North Korean hacking and internet usage Thursday, including recent developments in online crime, like sham cryptocurrencies. What they're saying: \"Start thinking of North Korea as a mob family,\" said Moriuchi. As with the mob, the nation's day-to-day petty crimes provide a foundation for the bigger efforts, like the bank heists and cryptocurrency market looting.Details: One interesting note from the Recorded Future report is that the few elite households that have access to the external internet within North Korea are using it more for business and less for entertainment than they were only a short while ago. That's intriguing for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the creation of potential targets for American cyber warriors. "}
