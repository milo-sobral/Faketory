{"id": "Axios", "paragraph": "The U.K. government plans to introduce a new \"digital services tax\" in 2020 that would force big American companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook to pay a tax of 2% of their British revenue. Why it matters: The tax, which is expected to raise \u00a3400 million annually, is one of several international efforts to levy stiffer corporate taxes that would hit U.S. tech giants hard. The details: The U.K. tax would apply to profitable companies making at least \u00a3500 million ($640 million) annually in revenue. Unprofitable companies like Netflix and Uber would be exempt.Why now: Some global tech companies have perfected the art of moving profits to countries with low tax rates. In response, countries are proposing to tax revenue instead of profits. That's because it's much harder for a company to move revenue than it is to move profits. What they're saying: U.S. tech companies see this as a direct assault and a way to curb their dominance abroad. Europeans say that's not true. Some in the tech industry want to see stronger U.S. objections. Our thought bubble, per Felix Salmon: It doesn't make much sense to introduce this type of regulation at the national level. A unified front from the OECD would be much harder for tech companies to game.   "}
