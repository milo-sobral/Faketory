Then someone suggested shooting me.By Bill McKibbenMr. McKibben is a founder of the environmental activism group 350.org.MIDDLEBURY, Vt. \u2014 In a world where the president goes on Twitter to call a woman \u201chorseface\u201d it seems pointless to call for \u201ccivility.\u201d So let me suggest that we start with a lower bar, maybe one we could still hope to achieve: Let\u2019s stop threatening to kill one another.One morning last week I had to write to a young colleague in the environmental movement. He works in South America, he\u2019d been getting death threats over social media and he was rightly alarmed. I could counsel him a little because I myself have been getting them, sporadically, for a long time. But I couldn\u2019t counsel him much, because what is there to say beyond \u201cBe careful, know that it\u2019s a tribute to your effectiveness and don\u2019t hesitate to take some time off\u201d? I was his age when I first started getting such threats, in the 1990s, and they\u2019ve escalated over the years as campaigns I\u2019ve helped organize against pipelines or for fossil fuel divestment have gained traction. I remember one police officer telling me that \u201cthe ones who write you aren\u2019t the ones who shoot you,\u201d which I found comforting for about 15 seconds till I thought through its implications. My practice has been just to delete threats from my email \u2014 I find that if I don\u2019t, I keep looking at them, and I imagine (I hope) the main goal of their authors is to distract me. If you\u2019re going to be a lightning rod, some sparks are probably the price.An hour after I\u2019d written to that young man, though, something happened that moved me to think about this more thoroughly. It began last week when The Los Angeles Times published an op-ed article of mine describing a trial in Minnesota where some protesters \u2014 acting peacefully, threatening no one and informing the company they were protesting against \u2014 engaged the emergency shut-off valves on two pipelines and forced the company to temporarily shut off the flow of oil from Canada\u2019s tar sands into the United States. The case against the protesters had been dismissed on the grounds that they\u2019d done no damage; I was trying in my essay to explain why nonviolent civil disobedience helped in the fight for a workable climate.Not everyone agreed. Indeed, a few hours after my essay appeared, a website called Watts Up With That? published an attack on my article. This enterprise \u2014 which bills itself as the most widely read website about the climate, and claims about three million to four million visitors a month \u2014 is devoted to proving we have nothing to fear from climate change. The author of the blog post, David Middleton, called me a misfit and made reference to my \u201csunken chest.\u201d Sure, whatever. Sadly, this just seems to be how politics unfolds in the age of Trump. But then the commenters went at it. One said: \u201cAnybody got Bill McKibben\u2019s home address? Let\u2019s see how he really feels about \u2018civil disobedience\u2019 if it shows up at his front door.\u201d Another added, \u201cGive him a smack for me.\u201d One or two tried to calm people down. But there was also this comment, from someone named \u201cgnomish:\u201d \u201cThere is a protocol worth observing: S.S.S. It stands for shoot, shovel and S.T.F.U. Hope that saves you some trouble.\u201d This \u201cprotocol\u201d was left over from the right-wing fight against endangered species laws. If, say, a protected woodpecker was on your land, the \u201cThree S\u2019s\u201d doctrine held that you should kill it, bury it and keep your mouth shut about it. It was, in this case, a public call for someone to murder me, and not long afterward another commenter, \u201cCarbon Bigfoot,\u201d supplied my home address.All of which stopped me cold.I thought I was inured to social media abuse. But this was something new: a calm public discussion about how to find me and what to do to me. No one deleted the comment by \u201cgnomish.\u201d The conversation just kept spiraling along.I know that this is much worse for women; I shudder to think what Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s email has been like lately. I know enough American history to understand that for people of color the deed has followed the threat with chilling regularity. I know that it\u2019s worse in other places \u2014 207 environmentalists or defenders were killed last year around the world. I have no idea if these people actually wish to murder me, though it\u2019s disconcerting to imagine who among those millions of visitors to the site will read the comments and decide to drive to my house.But aside from my own fear \u2014 and I\u2019m now installing surveillance cameras, because it turns out that public death threats slash through some of the psychic insulation privilege provides \u2014 what really bothered me was the matter-of-factness of it all. What does it say about a society when people just routinely call for the killing of those they disagree with? You\u2019ll note that \u201cgnomish\u201d abbreviated his profane phrase, because curse words are banned on this website. But its moderators apparently just read right past the death threat.Threatening to kill or rape someone shouldn\u2019t be banal. It should shock everyone who comes across such a threat. And that should go without saying, except that increasingly it doesn\u2019t, not in a world where the president has said that he longed for the days when disruptive protesters were carried away from the scene \u201con a stretcher.\u201d It\u2019s perversely heartening to see that the apparent murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi seems to have temporarily interrupted business as usual. Such shock and outrage is crucial, because in a world where dissenters are dismembered, there\u2019s no hope for change. The prospect that you\u2019ll be killed for what you say makes discussion essentially impossible. A society in which critics fear death is a society with fewer critics, and hence with fewer chances for change.I count nonviolence as perhaps the greatest invention of the 20th century, above all because it opens up the possibility for conversion, not domination. That was the point of my op-ed essay, the one that garnered me the death threat. But we should practice nonviolence in ways small as well as large, prosaic as well as dramatic. In the case of Watts Up With That, I\u2019d made the effort at de-escalation myself. A few years ago, I was scheduled to give an organizing talk in the small California town where the website\u2019s proprietor, Anthony Watts, lived. So I contacted him and invited him out for a beer. I knew I wouldn\u2019t change his mind on climate change, and he knew I would continue to think his work involved wrecking the planet. But it always seems like a human idea to reach out. And it was fine. We had a couple of beers, he wrote up an account of our conversation for his website, and even most of the commenters saluted us for sitting down and talking. (It was odd enough that it even got covered in The Times). But given the political world in which we live, a world in which tribes divide up and then beat their chests, it wasn\u2019t long before things were back to new ugly normal.I don\u2019t want this website shut down; I don\u2019t want the people who write on it prosecuted. I definitely don\u2019t want them murdered. I just want \u2014 as the very beginning of some kind of return to the gentler old normalcy \u2014 for people to stop making death threats. That seems to me the least we can ask of one another.Bill McKibben, a founder of 350.org, teaches environmental studies at Middlebury College and is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cFalter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?\u201dFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Advertisement"}
