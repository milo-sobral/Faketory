{"id": "E Tu Jim Mattis?", "paragraph": "Supported byThe defense secretary is the best of this administration. But even the best stumbles.By Frank BruniOpinion ColumnistIf almost any other member of President Trump\u2019s cabinet had sought to justify his deployment of thousands of troops to the border by talking about the threat of Mexican revolutionaries more than a century ago, it probably would have sailed right past me. Hyperbole, hysteria and convenient invocations of history are the native tongue of this administration, whose members were either fluent in it beforehand or picked it up quickly.But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who recently evoked that specter, was supposed to speak a better language. He was known to be a saner sort \u2014 not just the proverbial adult in the room but the conscience amid the corruption and the barricade against disaster. I like to think that millions of American parents instructed their children to expand their bedtime prayers. Watch over Mommy. Protect Daddy. And don\u2019t let anything bad happen to General Mattis.Well, something bad happened to General Mattis.On Wednesday he traveled to southernmost Texas to visit those troops. The trip was a good and necessary thing. President Trump, for all his lip service to venerating the military, doesn\u2019t go out of his way to mingle with or pay tribute to servicemen and servicewomen; somebody has to make them feel appreciated and important. That was Mattis\u2019s noble goal. He was trying to assure them that if they missed Thanksgiving, it wouldn\u2019t be for naught.But that wasn\u2019t doable without dabbling in deception, because the propping up of this president requires it.In Mattis\u2019s case, it required Pancho Villa.Pancho Villa was a Mexican revolutionary who, along with hundreds of armed followers, attacked an American border town, burning houses and killing people, before retreating back into Mexico, where President Woodrow Wilson ordered him pursued. Mattis revisited that episode in remarks to reporters on his way to Texas.\u201cI think many of you are aware that President Wilson 100 years ago \u2014 a little over 100 years ago \u2014 deployed the U.S. Army to the southwest border,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat then was Pancho Villa\u2019s troops, a revolutionary, raiding across the border into the United States \u2014 New Mexico \u2014 in 1916.\u201dInteresting. Also irrelevant. There\u2019s no Pancho Villa in the caravan of migrants proceeding north through Mexico. Trump has admitted as much. He didn\u2019t say so explicitly, but it\u2019s beyond obvious in his near-total silence about the situation since the midterms.Before Election Day, the caravan was a Trojan Horse for jihadists. It was an \u201cinvasion\u201d of such menace that soldiers might have to respond to any rocks thrown by the invaders with bullets. Trump used such overheated imagery in an effort to activate his base. To lend credibility to this scaremongering, he dispatched the troops.Now they\u2019re laying concertina wire when they\u2019re not twiddling their thumbs, and Trump has pretty much stopped mentioning the supposed enemy heading their way. Just like that \u2014 poof! \u2014 the caravan ceased to be an emergency. Apart from a rare, terse reappearance on Friday night, it exited his tweets.Many journalists have noted that, correctly deeming it proof that the deployment was a baldly, cynically political move. So Mattis told the troops on the border to ignore them. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of stuff in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read all that stuff, you know, you\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d Yes, because it\u2019s true. And to hint otherwise is to bolster Trump\u2019s dangerous demonization of the media and his branding of reporters as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201dMattis knows better. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u201cFear,\u201d he sees Trump clearly because he has seen Trump in private situations where his ignorance and recklessness were bare. Mattis had to explain to Trump that the American military presence in South Korea was a deterrent to North Korea. He had to ignore Trump\u2019s suggestion that American officials set in motion the assassination of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. He compared Trump\u2019s comprehension and acuity to those of \u201ca fifth or sixth grader.\u201dAnd then he felt Trump\u2019s lash, which confirmed for him what a petty creature the president is. On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month, Lesley Stahl asked Trump about Mattis\u2019s future in the administration, and Trump answered dismissively. \u201cI think he\u2019s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,\u201d he said, as if that designation discredited any opinion \u2014 especially of him \u2014 that Mattis held. \u201cHe may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves.\u201d Que sera sera. He\u2019s only the defense secretary. Only the most seasoned, qualified member of a cabinet whose average talent level is raised exponentially by his presence.Mattis, who subsequently told reporters that he doesn\u2019t belong to either political party, has stuck with Trump for what seem to be the best reasons. More than his predecessors, the president needs competent, even-keeled people around him, and there\u2019s no surfeit of A-list takers for even the administration\u2019s highest-ranking jobs. The working environment leaves something to be desired. So does the boss.But there\u2019s a fine line between taming the president and enabling him \u2014 between tempering the way he governs and implicitly validating it. To stand beside him is to signal assent. To gloss over his motives is to launder them. And that\u2019s what Mattis did during his visit to the troops, who no doubt yearned to hear that their presence made sense but could be told that only if Mattis lied for the president and to all of us.Or fibbed, at least. Misdirected. Blabbered. He suggested to the troops that they were really there at the behest of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, to support the Border Patrol. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that her people do all the work, but we\u2019re standing behind them as a confidence builder, and that sort of thing.\u201dA confidence builder? That sort of thing? He couldn\u2019t hide the dubiousness of their charge even as he tried to sell it. \u201cA moral and ethical mission\u201d was how he described it to the journalists who accompanied him. If that were so, Pancho Villa wouldn\u2019t have had to ride in.Mattis didn\u2019t lurch anywhere near as far into fiction as others in the administration routinely do. But the spectacle was somehow sadder for its subtlety, which underscored the bind that even the most cautious and conscientious administration official is in, the impossibility of finding some honorable balance of principle and obeisance, prudence and deference.It\u2019s not true, as the Republican strategist Rick Wilson wrote, that everything Trump touches dies. But everything wilts, at least if it\u2019s in his employ long enough. That\u2019s why Nikki Haley announced that she\u2019d leave her post as ambassador to the United Nations around the two-year mark. Miraculously, she has managed to fill a big hole in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without putting a big dent in her reputation, and she knows that the longer she stays, the more she tempts fate.Mattis just proved her right.I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
