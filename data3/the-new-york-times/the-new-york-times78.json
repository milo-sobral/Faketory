{"id": "4 Ways World Leaders Have Echoed Trump\u2019s Words and Policies", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Megan SpeciaThe president of the United States has one of the most powerful bully pulpits in the world.President Trump has used that platform to spread his populist message through language often shorn of diplomatic niceties and demeaning of his opponents. And his language has been picked up by a number of leaders in other countries to offer justification of their own actions and to promote like-minded policies.Some leaders \u2014 or leaders of national institutions \u2014 have used similar language to go after political opponents, push their own populist agendas or even shield themselves from criticism of human rights abuses or the erosion of democratic norms. The latest example came on Friday, when the Nigerian army cited remarks by Mr. Trump to defend its owns actions after fatally shooting unarmed protesters.Mr. Trump has excited his base with calls to crack down on illegal migration on the southern border of the United States. In a news conference on Thursday, he suggested that American military personnel could fire on migrants who threw rocks at them.\u201cThey\u2019re going to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI told them consider it a rifle.\u201d Mr. Trump later qualified his statement by saying, \u201cThat doesn't mean shoot them.\u201dBut less than 24 hours after his first remarks, the Nigerian army posted a video of the comments on Twitter to justify its own soldiers\u2019 fatal shooting of rock-wielding  protesters earlier in the week. The army later deleted the post, though a spokesman defended its use.The government said three protesters were killed in the confrontation on Monday in the capital, Abuja. Rights groups say more than 40 people died in that episode and in two smaller protests before and after. The soldiers fired on a march of about 1,000 Islamic Shiite activists who had blocked traffic on the outskirts of the capital. Footage posted on social media showed several protesters hurling rocks at soldiers, and soldiers shooting some of the protesters as they fled.Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has regularly deflected criticism with cries of \u201cfake news.\u201d He has also used the term to sow distrust of established news media and create doubts in the minds of voters as to whom and what can be trusted. The tactic has widely been copied by other leaders, who have used it in their own speeches and interviews, seeking similar effect. In response to a February 2017 Amnesty International report saying his government was responsible for thousands of secret deaths in prisons, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria told Yahoo News: \u201cYou can forge anything these days. We are living in a fake-news era.\u201dSpeaking to The New York Times in December, a Myanmar security official denied the existence of a large Muslim minority group, the Rohingya. \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya,\u201d said the official, U Kyaw San Hla, calling the statement \u201cfake news.\u201d The military in Myanmar has carried out brutal and systematic attacks on the Rohingya, using the \u201cfake news\u201d response to dismiss scrutiny. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a close ally of Mr. Trump, regularly invokes \u201cfake news\u201d now to denounce his critics, labeling the work of several major news outlets as that in posts on social media. Poland\u2019s right-wing government, which has aligned itself closely with Mr. Trump, has picked up the phrase, too. President Andrzej Duda has restricted press freedom in his own country, signing into law a bill giving the government broad controls over the news media.  He posted a message on Twitter in January in support of Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated use of the term.Since hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers entered the European Union in 2015, migration has become one of the Continent\u2019s most divisive issues. And in talking about it, Europe\u2019s populists and right-wing politicians have found common cause with Mr. Trump. He has cited and supported their anti-immigration positions, and they have used that backing and his slogans and tough talk to bolster their own positions.Theo Francken, Belgium\u2019s immigration minister and an enthusiastic follower of Mr. Trump on social media, on Friday pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s call to end birthright citizenship in the United States as a step to emulate. \u201cA lot can be said in favor of this idea,\u201d including in Belgium, he said. Mr. Francken recently wrote a book about Europe, \u201cContinent Without Borders,\u201d that called for locking down European Union bordersThe leader of Italy's right-wing League party, Matteo Salvini, has also drawn inspiration from the American president.Mr. Salvini, who wields considerable sway as the country\u2019s interior minister and deputy prime minister, came to power on an anti-immigrant platform. And he adopted the slogan \u201cItalians First\u201d while campaigning this year, an echo of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d motto. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, populist leaders with a similarly brash style, have risen to power. Brazil\u2019s newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, rallied supporters with calls like \u201cLet\u2019s make Brazil great\u201d that were reminiscent of Mr. Trump\u2019s election slogan. His recent election marked a radical shift to the right in one of the world\u2019s largest democracies.Mr. Bolsonaro, who takes office in January, said this week that he plans to follow suit on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most contentious foreign policy actions \u2014 by moving the Brazilian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem. Last year, Mr. Trump reversed nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and set off Palestinian outrage by moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem.And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro has also strongly criticized the United Nations for what he sees as overreach.
