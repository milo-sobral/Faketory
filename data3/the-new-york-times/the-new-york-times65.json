{"id": "Mary Keitany Earns 4th New York Marathon Title, 3 Minutes Ahead of Pack", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Lindsay CrouseMary Keitany was back where she prefers to be Sunday in the New York City Marathon \u2014 far, far ahead of everyone else. Keitany, an Olympian from Kenya, took off alone in the race\u2019s second half and finished more than three minutes ahead of her challengers, with a time of 2 hours 22 minutes 48 seconds. It was her fourth victory here, and the second fastest race any woman has run on this course.It started out typically enough. For the first half of the race, Keitany, 36, tucked into a pack of about 24 women, including some of the top talent in this event. Keeping her stride loose, Keitany looked like just another jogger \u2014 albeit, a pretty fast one \u2014 as she made her way through the early stages.Once she reached Manhattan, though, there was a race to run.Soon out of view of her closest opponent, Keitany tore through the second half of the marathon in 1:06:58, a time few women in the field had achieved. It was about nine minutes faster than her first half, and she never wavered as she ground toward the finish.But by now, Keitany is used to running like this. After all, she has the second-fastest time of any woman in the marathon, behind only Paula Radcliffe.\u201cNothing was special today,\u201d she said afterward. \u201cI was just ready for the race.\u201d[Lelisa Desisa won the men\u2019s race in today\u2019s New York City Marathon.]Her expression was casual, as though she could have headed back to Staten Island and do it all over again.Manuela Sch\u00e4r of Switzerland won the title in the women\u2019s wheelchair division for the second straight year, with a time of 1:50:27.When Keitany is at the top of her game, she is notoriously difficult to touch. She is known for taking off early in the race and challenging her rivals to follow \u2014 which she did in 2014, 2015, and again in 2016. And then Sunday, as her pace dipped below five minutes per mile, none of those rivals had an answer.They included another woman from Kenya, Vivian Cheruiyot, 35, who took second place in 2:26:02.And then there was a chasing pack of American women, who collectively finished the best they had since 1978.The Americans were led by the defending champion Shalane Flanagan, 37, who took third in 2:26:22.Even though Flanagan did not retain her title, her satisfaction was just as high, and her time \u2014 with the ideal conditions of 46 degrees, calm and sunny \u2014 was better. Last year, as she closed in on the victory tape at New York, breaking Keitany\u2019s winning streak, Flanagan was yelling expletives in a euphoria.This year, her finish was similarly emotional. But this time, she yelled to the crowds cheering her on, \u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cI was just overcome with emotion, in that stretch, as everyone is,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cIt was like, yeah, I love this community, I love the running community and I love New Yorkers. I\u2019ve had an unbelievable time performing here.\u201dIt may be Flanagan\u2019s final professional race. She used her looming retirement as motivation to showcase the speed that helped her outkick Keitany last year and that has earned her a silver medal in the 10,000 meters in the 2008 Olympics.As any hope of catching Keitany and repeating her victory from last year dissipated Sunday, Flanagan closed in on Rahma Tusa of Ethiopia, who was fading in the final miles, and sprinted away to secure a podium finish.\u201cAs I was racing and kind of feeling sorry for myself, you have to find motivation, things to rally and to focus on,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cWhen I got dropped by Mary and a bunch of other women, I kept thinking, \u2018Keep fighting.\u2019 You never know what\u2019s going to happen in front of you, and just put your head down, keep working and fight for that podium spot.\u201dFlanagan\u2019s performance rounded out a collection of medals from her appearances in the New York Marathon, adding a bronze to last year\u2019s gold and a silver in 2010.It was a breakout day for American distance runners overall. Four of them finished in the top seven; in comparison, the top American to finish in the men\u2019s race was Jared Ward, in sixth place. The American record-holder in the half marathon, Molly Huddle, finished behind Flanagan in fourth. The defending Boston Marathon champion, Desiree Linden, finished sixth. And Allie Kieffer, who as a self-coached unknown last year finished fifth place, took seventh today behind Linden.\u201cAmericans right now are a great group of runners,\u201d Linden said.She added: \u201cWe\u2019re continually pushing the bar for each other. Now you can win a major one year and not even be the top American at the next race, which is insane.\u201dAdvertisement"}
