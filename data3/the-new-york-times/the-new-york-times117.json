{"id": "Variety: Puns and Anagrams", "paragraph": "Supported byVariety CROSSWORD COLUMNBabies, what are we doing? Erik Agard\u2019s first Puns and Anagrams puzzle!By Caitlin LovingerSUNDAY VARIETY PUZZLE COLUMN \u2014  It looks like Erik Agard is further branching out \u2014 although I could definitely be missing efforts made elsewhere, this is his first variety grid for The Times. I somewhat paled at the thought of trying to keep up with his cool sense of humor, which is already on display in our straightforward grids, but this was a very nice, mellow undertaking. There were many unadorned anagrams to work on today. One of my favorite examples was 9A, \u201cLatest Starbucks creations\u201d: For some reason I got stuck on \u201clatest\u201d almost rearranging to Seattle (it was just that last E!), and totally missed LATTES, which are, indeed, delicious coffee creations. 1A: On the face of it, this clue looks a little impossible, but numbers in clues are hints themselves. Try thinking of \u201c100\u201d as C; \u201c100 in total,\u201d then, becomes C OVERALL, COVERALL.18A: Likewise, directions are usually hints in cryptic clues. In this case, \u201cdumpier rec center\u201d: Look in the center of \u201cdumpier rec\u201d for PIERRE, which is a \u201cstate capital.\u201d 25A does this with \u201cmiddle\u201d instead; 7D does it with \u201cRemain in.\u201d 19A: Here\u2019s another hidden hint that appears in puns: Even and odd. In this case, \u201cNot even!\u201d at the end of the clue wasn\u2019t idiomatic \u2014 it meant that if you simply wrote the odd letters down, at the first, third, fifth, seventh and ninth position of \u201cstagnation,\u201d you\u2019d have your answer: SANTO, a male saint.28A: \u201cQuipped\u201d cream and \u201cQuedding\u201d gowns have a letter substitution in common \u2014 \u201cQu\u201d for \u201cWh\u201d \u2014 that would make \u201cwhite,\u201d which describes both things, QUITE.29A: A clever little sound substitution combined with an anagram, \u201cEyes\u201d in this case meant \u201ci\u2019s\u201d \u2014 plus \u201cthat,\u201d scrambled, gets you the \u201cPolynesian island\u201d of TAHITI. Let\u2019s go!35A: Here we have the hint of omission; what letters are in this sequence? NOT E. (A similar tactic will help you solve 49D.) 44A: And here we have something else left out. \u201cReduced salt,\u201d or sodium, becomes ODIUM.48A: Ah, here\u2019s the \u201ce\u201d we were missing in 35A. It\u2019s little and there\u2019s a period in front of it \u2014 DOTE, in other words. This same thought pops up with 5D, that red O.51A: Here\u2019s a fill-in-the-blanks; if you deduce the three missing letters as CPU, that\u2019s your \u201ccomputer guts\u201d right there. This trick pops up at 9D and 32D.53A: An \u201cI\u201d atop an \u201cIC?\u201d That\u2019s IONIC.59A: If an undercover agent gets her mission in a letter from the agency, does a cyberspy get her EMISSION via email?3D: This clue strikes me as highly original (Agardian?). If a magician makes the lady disappear with a poof, then \u201cproof!\u201d could conceivably make something VARNISH, right? 8D: This was another clever bit. Think of L.A. for Hollywood \u2014 thugs from there would be LAGOONS.11D: This is one of those unfathomable-to-anyone-else-but-us little things. The 3rd, 4th and 6th letters in October? That would spell TOE.28D: My least understood clue of the day, I think. I see the \u201cQ&A\u201d on the sailor, or \u201ctar,\u201d to get QATAR; I don\u2019t quite know where \u201chome\u201d fits in. 41D: A big hill, i.e., is a MOUNTIE.52D: Tricky combo, Mr. Agard! The next letter after \u201cnu, xi, omicron \u2026\u201d is PI; there are eight more characters in the Greek alphabet, and you\u2019re to put those in the postscript, or P.S., to get PIPS.57D: Almost done! If you\u2019re carnivorous, go get yourself a nice grass-fed steak \u2014 a RIB-eye, perhaps.What did you think?Advertisement"}
