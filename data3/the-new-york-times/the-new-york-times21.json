{"id": "What Business Casual Really Means", "paragraph": "Supported byDifferent people, different companies and different parts of the world have different ideas of appropriate apparel for work. Here\u2019s how to cut through the confusion and pick a simple, versatile wardrobe.By Lizz SchumerWhether you are entering the work force for the first time, starting a new job or changing fields, choosing what to wear to work has never been more complicated. What constitutes \u201cbusiness casual\u201d varies among companies, industries and parts of the world.Angie Cox, a Seattle-based stylist, fashion consultant and founder of YouLookFab.com, has watched the field evolve over her 13 years in it. \u201cThe whole concept of business casual has just changed dramatically, even within the change in dress codes,\u201d she said.Before you grab your wallet and go clothes shopping, though, it pays to gather some intel. We asked stylists and experts from across the country to weigh in on what business casual really means, and how men and women new to a job or to the job market can dress for success.If you\u2019re starting at a new company, use the internet to your advantage. Alison Gary, a stylist and founder of the Washington-based style website Wardrobe Oxygen, suggests Googling your future co-workers before your first interview. \u201cIn 2018, it\u2019s a lot easier to find images of people working at the company,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can get a better sense of what their office culture is like.\u201dOnce you step foot in the office, look at what others are wearing, both in your department and across the board. \u201cI go by the whole old-school term of \u2018dress not for the job you have, but the job you want,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Gary said. \u201cLook at people who are in positions higher than you and see how they dress.\u201dKat Griffin, the founder of the fashion advice site Corporette, said it was important to take seniority into account when looking at what your managers wear. \u201cSenior people have a huge bank of credibility \u2014 they\u2019ve earned the right to dress how they please,\u201d she said. \u201cI advise readers to a) know generally what might not be acceptable, and b) to not wear any of those items until you see a midlevel person wear them, someone three to five years ahead of you.\u201dAll of the stylists we consulted suggested erring on the dressier, more conservative side for an interview, but that does not necessarily mean a full suit. You\u2019ll generally be safe with coordinating separates, for women, or shirts and slacks for men.Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert, author and founder of the Protocol School of Texas, advised taking stock of how an outfit makes you feel. \u201cWhen choosing an outfit for the interview, remember, when you look good, you feel good,\u201d she said. \u201cUse your wardrobe choices to give an extra boost of self-confidence.\u201dKeep fit and grooming in mind, too. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear neutrals, you don\u2019t need to worry about being conservative,\u201d Ms. Cox said. \u201cYou do need to be covered; you mustn\u2019t wear anything too tight.\u201d Avoid perfume, as many people are sensitive to scent. She also suggested taking a jacket, for versatility. If your interviewer has on a blazer, now you do too. If not, take it off.Ms. Cox added that jingly jewelry could get distracting. \u201cEven if it\u2019s your signature to wear a lot of arm candy, don\u2019t go in with a lot of bangles that are going to be noisy,\u201d she said. The same goes for flip-flops or loud shoes: You don\u2019t want the whole floor to hear you coming. If you have tattoos, Ms. Cox also does not recommend covering them for the interview. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to cover up your tattoos to come to work, you\u2019re not going to cover them for the interview,\u201d she said.Most important, remember that most industries are not going to judge you too harshly for what you wear to your first meeting. As long as your outfit does not distract from how you present yourself, you\u2019re probably in good shape.Once you have signed your offer letter, it\u2019s time to get your first-day outfit ready. But resist the urge to go on a shopping spree right away. All of the stylists we consulted recommend stocking a few relatively neutral outfits for your first week. Take that time to watch what your new co-workers wear and follow their lead.Mrs. Gary, who specializes in capsule wardrobes, likes hitting the sales rack and avoiding statement pieces, which you can\u2019t be reworn as often. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to have 30 pairs of pants in your wardrobe, if you can find a good pair,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is going to know if you\u2019re wearing the same pair of pants two or three times in a week if you\u2019re styling them in different ways.\u201d The office, she said, \u201cis not the runway.\u201d Start with a classic blazer, a pair of well-fitting pants, a blouse or button-down shirt, and a sweater that can all mix and match.Ms. Cox recommends asking the human resources manager to clue you in to the dress code. And whatever you choose, watch your silhouette. \u201cWhen wearing extremely fitted pieces, the focus is on the body instead of the work,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the body is great, but the job is supposed to be about the job.\u201dWhen deciding what is office-appropriate, the location of your office and your industry are important. In general, Silicon Valley tech, nonprofit and start-up culture skew more casual than New York City finance and business, which are different from what Nashville lawyers might wear. Look around for clues, and when in doubt, ask.\u201cI know that being in D.C., our version of business casual is drastically different from say, Silicon Valley business casual,\u201d Mrs. Gary said. \u201cTheirs is, \u2018Don\u2019t wear flip-flops,\u2019 where ours is, \u2018Don\u2019t wear denim except on Friday.\u2019\u201dMs. Cox and Ms. Gottsman also recommend dressing for your audience. If you are working in a farming community, starched denim and a polo shirt may be more appropriate than a suit. Conversely, if you are in the medical or legal profession, you want to dress a level up from your clients or patients. \u201cYou have to look at the environment in addition to the corporate policy,\u201d Ms. Gottsman advised. Your attire \u201cshould say, \u2018I care.\u2019 I think that that\u2019s really what it boils down to,\u201d she added. \u201cHaving respect for the people that you\u2019re with, and having respect for yourself, as well.\u201dBottom line? You want your attire to inspire confidence in your colleagues, managers, and clients. \u201cPeople make judgments based on what they see, and that perception becomes their version of the truth,\u201d Ms. Gottsman said. \u201cDressing in a professional manner shows you pay attention to detail and take pride in yourself, which also translates into your work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
