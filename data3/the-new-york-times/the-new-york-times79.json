{"id": "Another Trump Scoop, a Giddy Reaction and a Reporter Under Fire", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Michael M. GrynbaumWASHINGTON \u2014 Jonathan Swan could not sleep.It was 4 a.m. last Wednesday, and Mr. Swan, the star White House correspondent for the upstart news outlet Axios, was tapping out a Slack message to his colleagues.\u201cI wish I could redo that moment,\u201d Mr. Swan wrote, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, because you all have to work at Axios and bear whatever reputational damage I do to the company.\u201dHours earlier, Mr. Swan, 33, had done what he usually does, the thing that turned him from an obscure Australian striver into a uniquely Washington figure of envy, fascination and contempt: he landed a big story. In an interview posted Tuesday, Mr. Swan had cajoled President Trump into acknowledging that he wants to end automatic citizenship for immigrant children born in the United States.Like other Swan scoops \u2014 Nikki Haley leaving her job; the withdrawal from the Paris climate accord; \u201cexecutive time\u201d \u2014 this one sent newsrooms scrambling. But online, disgust among liberals at the president\u2019s policy plans quickly morphed into disgust with Mr. Swan.Why did a video clip of the interview show him smiling so gleefully as Mr. Trump confirmed his reporting? Why was he \u201cexcited to share\u201d the news as a preview of Axios\u2019s new HBO show, rather than a policy with real-world, possibly devastating impact? Why didn\u2019t he challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s bogus claim that no other country offers birthright citizenship? (At least 30 others do.) One columnist called him a \u201cbootlicker\u201d; another went with \u201cthe ne plus ultra of media toadying.\u201dTo cover Mr. Trump\u2019s White House is to play in a treacherous arena. But Mr. Swan has struck a bigger nerve than most.He has scaled journalism\u2019s most competitive beat with brute force (competitors say his calendar is booked weeks ahead); a TV-ready persona (he is a regular on the cable circuit); and a truffle-pig\u2019s nose for news. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the most plugged-in person in Washington,\u201d said Sally Quinn, the Washington journalism doyenne and a friend.Still, his rise has come with accusations of coziness: that he favors access over accountability; that he irritates the White House, but rarely infuriates it. Many journalists here have lucrative TV deals (including at The New York Times), but some grumble about Mr. Swan\u2019s gigs as a paid corporate speaker, including a roughly $20,000 appearance at Goldman Sachs that other news organizations would prohibit for their reporters.That Mr. Swan works for Axios, the rapid-fire news site founded by the Politico creators Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, brings its own complications. Its stripped-down version of journalism (motto: \u201csmart brevity\u201d) means its articles are presented as bullet points that can negate nuance, with headlines that can hype.All of which places Mr. Swan at a sticky nexus of journalistic ethics and best practices in an era when the audience for White House reporting has never been bigger \u2014 and the judgments never harsher. Ratings and subscriptions are up, and reporters become household names, but they are often denounced as \u201cfake news\u201d by the right and as brown-nosers by the left.\u201cHow do you practice insider journalism with an administration that a large share of the country is rooting for, regardless of the truth of the president\u2019s claims, and that another large part thinks is morally repugnant?\u201d said Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed News (and a former employee of Mr. VandeHei\u2019s). \u201cThat is a really hard challenge.\u201dFor all the slings and arrows sent his way, Mr. Swan, who declined to comment for this article in the wake of last week\u2019s dust-up, has lived his own American dream.The son of Norman Swan, a prominent television journalist in Australia, he arrived here in 2014 after a promising career in the Canberra trenches, where among other scoops he discovered video of an Australian senator hurling the feces of a kangaroo.On a visa for a congressional fellowship, he spent nearly a year being rejected for reporting positions until landing a job at The Hill. \u201cI probably interviewed five or six hundred people in my life, and I just knew right away that he was going to be a great reporter,\u201d said Bob Cusack, the editor in chief.Sources and competitors of Mr. Swan, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because, well, it\u2019s Washington, described a hustler and charmer with a herculean work ethic, often squeezing in four source meetings a day. \u201cHe seemed drawn to me,\u201d recalled Ms. Quinn, who met him at an Axios party at Nobu. \u201cHe asked me to dinner.\u201dOver an Italian meal, Ms. Quinn said, she discovered \u201ca special, exceptional person.\u201d She added, \u201cWhen he\u2019s talking to you, he never looks bored or distracted in any way. He wants to know everything, but he\u2019s also genuine in talking about himself and his life and his hopes and dreams.\u201dSometimes, his eagerness can backfire.On Sept. 24, political journalists were thrown into a tizzy when Mr. Swan reported that Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, had verbally resigned. The fate of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation seemed at stake. Networks broke in with special reports as their journalists tried to match the news.Six weeks later, Mr. Rosenstein is still in his post. It emerged that while Mr. Rosenstein had indeed offered his resignation, nobody had accepted it. Mr. Swan later wrote that he \u201cscrewed up by giving it a certainty it didn\u2019t warrant,\u201d and Axios clarified its article.In a hair-trigger news environment, the episode revealed the power and peril of Mr. Swan\u2019s position. It also renewed questions about Axios\u2019s approach to news.Introduced in 2017 and pronounced \u201cACKS-ee-ohs\u201d (its founders wanted \u201cack-see-US,\u201d until eventually realizing that nobody else said it that way), the site says it strips away the flab and filler of traditional journalism for busy readers.But critics say it presents articles with little context \u2014 political, ethical or otherwise \u2014 an approach that can ring hollow for some readers who are in the grips of an existential moment for the country.Mr. VandeHei, who faced similar criticism when he started Politico, rejected that notion.\u201cJournalists have a bad, bad habit of equating length with substance and depth,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you look at the architecture of our site, the whole idea is to tell you what\u2019s new, why does it matter, and give you the power to go deeper.\u201d Politico alumni work at a host of prestigious publications, including The Times. \u201cThree to five years from now, there will be a lot more people writing the way we do than the old way,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said.Mr. Swan is the piston of the Axios engine; Mr. Allen likes to call him \u201cbionic.\u201d But that has made him a target for critics of his employer. His Goldman Sachs appearance, though cleared with management, was considered unseemly by rivals, and it echoed past criticisms that Mr. Allen at Politico was too cozy with advertisers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of people who have true subject matter expertise and we want to share that,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said.The HBO series on Axios, set to begin Sunday night, brings a new level of exposure for Mr. Swan, and it was the peg for the 70-second clip on Tuesday featuring his newsmaking moment with the president. \u201cJonathan, I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Mr. Trump says in the clip, after Mr. Swan raised the issue of birthright citizenship. \u201cGood guess,\u201d the reporter replied, tapping his head.The exchange was skewered online, though it was the kind of byplay that, off-camera, is typical in interviews. Reporters want sources, even a president, to feel comfortable and keep talking. In his late-night Slack message last week, Mr. Swan, who wrote that he had been trying to confirm the immigration news for weeks, told colleagues that \u201cmy brain popped.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not used to having my facial expression recorded,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised given it\u2019s an inflammatory immigration question and we\u2019re a few days out from the midterms, but what you saw was authentic surprise.\u201dThree current and former Trump White House officials praised Mr. Swan\u2019s fairness, even as they acknowledged his coverage was often unfriendly. One person said that the White House canceled a presidential interview with Axios after Mr. Swan published a tough piece on the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his penchant for snoozing in meetings.Mr. Swan\u2019s foreign origins have also been wielded against him. Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, recalled Mr. Swan once calling him for comment on a negative story. \u201cO.K., killer, remind me again of your visa status?\u201d Mr. Bannon replied.Peter Hartcher, Mr. Swan\u2019s former editor at The Sydney Morning Herald, called him \u201ca naturally exuberant human being,\u201d saying in an interview: \u201cAt first blush you think, \u2018Who does this guy think he\u2019s kidding?\u2019 But it\u2019s completely natural.\u201d\u201cFrom kangaroo turds to Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Hartcher added. \u201cHe\u2019s come quite a long distance, hasn\u2019t he?\u201dFriends say that Mr. Swan has ambitions to write long-form pieces. For now, though, he is happy at his station: He recently renewed his contract at Axios through mid-2021. He also has equity in the company, which has raised roughly $30 million from major investors like NBC, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Laurene Powell Jobs.As for Mr. Swan\u2019s tough week, his friends are standing by him. \u201cI\u2019d like to have Swan with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. VandeHei said. And Ms. Quinn said that she \u201cdidn\u2019t quite understand the backlash.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very sweet, I think he\u2019s genuine,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cAnd of course he\u2019s ambitious. Tell me who isn\u2019t, you know?\u201dAdvertisement"}
