But more than six decades after Dorcas B. Reilly invented the classic American dish of green-bean casserole when she worked in the Campbell Soup Company test kitchen, it remains a staple at Thanksgiving Day dinners across the country.Mrs. Reilly, who died on Oct. 15 at a hospital in Camden, was among the first full-time employees of the Campbell\u2019s home economics department, where she helped to create recipes printed on the labels of its products. Her husband, Thomas H. Reilly, confirmed her death. She was 92.\u201cWe worked in the kitchen with things that were most likely to be in most homes,\u201d Mrs. Reilly once said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy. And it\u2019s not an expensive thing to make, too.\u201dHer recipe calls for mixing a can of cream of mushroom soup, cooked green beans, a bit of milk, soy sauce and pepper. Pop it in the oven, toss some crunchy fried onions on top, and voil\u00e0.The dish epitomizes the easy recipes that became popular in the 1950s, when companies promoted them to increase demand for their products.\u201cIt was convenience with a touch of glamour,\u201d said Laura Shapiro, a culinary historian and author of \u201cSomething From the Oven,\u201d a book about American cuisine in the 1950s.She added that the French\u2019s crispy fried onions that the recipe called for were the \u201ctouch of genius\u201d in the dish.Mrs. Reilly was a supervisor in 1955 when she first put together the recipe, originally called the \u201cGreen Bean Bake,\u201d for an article by The Associated Press. It was among hundreds she had created, including a tuna-noodle casserole and Sloppy Joe \u201csouperburgers.\u201dBut none became quite as famous as the Green Bean Bake. The company says that more than 20 million American homes will serve the dish this Thanksgiving.\u201cShe took a lot of pride in it,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cShe was delighted when anybody said they liked it, and most everybody liked it.\u201dIn interviews over the years, Mrs. Reilly noted that the casserole\u2019s appeal was in its simplicity. It employed the popular Midwestern technique of using a creamy soup to bind a casserole, but mixed in some new ingredients. It took off when Campbell\u2019s began printing the recipe on its cans of cream of mushroom soup.Dorcas Lillian Bates was born on July 22, 1926, in Woodbury, N.J. Her mother, Dorcas Lillian Webb, was a homemaker, and her father, Frederick Bates, was an electrician at the Drexel Institute of Technology, now known as Drexel University.She and her brother, Linwood Tomlinson Bates, grew up in Glassboro, N.J., and Camden. She attended Camden High School, along with Thomas H. Reilly, whom she would marry in 1959.In a phone interview, Mr. Reilly said Wednesday that he fell in love with her in the fall of 1940, \u201cbut it took awhile\u201d to get together. He served in World War II and the Korean War after high school, while she studied home economics at Drexel. After graduation, she went to work at the Campbell\u2019s test kitchen in Camden.Mr. Reilly said his wife had grown up in a family of cooks, which spurred her love of food. Even after spending all day in a test kitchen, she would cook at home as well, experimenting and using fresh ingredients. She did make a lot of soup, Mr. Reilly said.The couple settled in Haddonfield, N.J., where Mr. Reilly got a job as a high school English teacher. The couple had one son, Thomas B. Reilly, and a daughter, Dorcas Tarbell.In addition to her husband and children, Mrs. Reilly is also survived by four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.Mrs. Reilly left Campbell\u2019s in 1961 to raise her children, but returned years later as a manager, a position she held until she retired in 1988.In 2002, Campbell\u2019s donated the original recipe card for the green-bean casserole, written by Mrs. Reilly, to the National Inventors Hall of Fame.These days, fresh ingredients and complicated recipes are all the rage, and the creamy casseroles of the 1950s are decidedly out of fashion, and sometimes derided. But because it became so ubiquitous at holidays, the green-bean casserole endures, evoking powerful nostalgia for many Americans.\u201cIf you have the love and memory of this, you will never think it\u2019s gross,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said. \u201cYou will think of it as the food of your past and you will cherish it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
