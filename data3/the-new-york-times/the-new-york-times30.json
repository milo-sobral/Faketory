{"id": "Subway Fare That Stinks: Nachos, Meat ... Crab Legs?", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Emma G. FitzsimmonsIt is an unspoken compact among subway riders in New York City: If you are going to eat on the train, keep it simple. But sometimes, there are messy scofflaws.The subway\u2019s leader, Andy Byford, drew a line in the sand this week, urging riders not to eat roast chicken on the train.\u201cI don\u2019t mind someone having a snack,\u201d Mr. Byford said at a board meeting of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Monday. \u201cA full-on subway meal or a roast chicken, leaving the bones all over the place, isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201dMr. Byford, the president of New York City Transit, weighed in on the long-running debate about whether food should be banned on the subway during a board discussion about track fires. The current subway rules permit eating, though they prohibit carrying liquids in an open container \u2014 a provision that is rarely enforced. Carelessly tossed out food containers can cause fires.On Wednesday, Mr. Byford doubled down on his comments, telling reporters that the person he witnessed eating roast chicken had gone too far.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to come up with a definitive list,\u201d Mr. Byford said, in reference to foods that are rude. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s not considerate.\u201dLast year, the authority\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, said he would consider banning food, as Washington\u2019s Metro system does. Mr. Lhota cited a rider eating Chinese food that fell on the floor.Mr. Lhota said on Wednesday that food should not be banned, but that New Yorkers need to learn to be more polite about it.\u201cI\u2019m equally as offended as Andy is about seeing people drop the remains on the floor,\u201d Mr. Lhota said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201dSo in the absence of any official prohibition where exactly is the line when it comes to food on the subway? Riders voiced their opinions on Twitter this week, with reports of cheesy nachos, a carton of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, King Crab legs and edamame pods spit on the ground. (All of which presumably would make it on Mr. Byford\u2019s list.)One subway rider, Paul Brady, saw \u201ca guy eating roast pork and fried rice with chopsticks out of a Styrofoam clamshell this very morning on the F.\u201dIt is an unofficial law that you \u201cdon\u2019t eat anything with an aroma that exceeds your physical space, except pizza, but only if it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re eating it as fast as you possibly can,\u201d Dan Rivoli, The New York Daily News transit reporter, posted on Twitter.Some foods, riders agreed, were fair game \u2014 and maybe even necessary if riders never know how long they will be stuck on a train. Others suggested that the authority had bigger problems, like the subway service. \u201cI am offended by trains that don\u2019t work,\u201d one rider posted on Twitter.Mr. Byford, a respected transit leader who previously worked in London and Toronto, said he had never seen roast chicken on the subway in those cities. But he had seen other delicacies.\u201cYou see often in London, particularly on a Friday or Saturday night, you do see people eating burgers,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cEating a burger, I get it on a Friday night, you get the munchies. But don\u2019t then drop half of your order on the floor and smear your hands on the seat.\u201dEven Charles G. Moerdler, the M.T.A. board member who asked Mr. Byford about food, seemed to know he was raising a thorny issue.\u201cTo add kerosene to the fire, have you given thought to removing the right to sell food on the subway or to eat on the subway as a way to avoid rubbish accumulated on the tracks?\u201d Mr. Moerdler said.For some, Mr. Byford\u2019s comments ignore the reality that New Yorkers who juggle several jobs or have long commutes may be more pressed for time and their subway ride is the only chance they have to eat.In 2012, Mr. Lhota struck a more compassionate tone. He said he did not want to ban eating on the subway because it could hurt some communities. He said he had watched too many children eating breakfast on-the-go, like bagels or muffins.\u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the kid,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lhota said, \u201cthe only time that day he\u2019s going to get food.\u201dAdvertisement"}
