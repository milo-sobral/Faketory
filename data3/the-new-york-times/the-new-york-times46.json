{"id": "Horacio Cardo, Illustrator With a Political Edge, Is Dead at 74", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Richard SandomirHoracio Cardo, an Argentine artist whose phantasmagorical paintings and collages were known for their compelling commentary about politics, war, social issues and Freudian psychoanalysis, died on Oct. 22 in Pinamar, a resort city on the eastern coast of Buenos Aires Province. He was 74.His son, Iara, said the cause was complications of a stroke.Mr. Cardo\u2019s evocative work appeared in many publications, including Clar\u00edn, Argentina\u2019s largest newspaper, and The New York Times, where he and artists like Ralph Steadman, Eugene Mihaesco and Brad Holland turned the Op-Ed page into a showcase for idiosyncratic graphic viewpoints in the 1970s and \u201980s.\u201cHe was one of the illustrators who drew people to the Op-Ed page with unusually strong commentary,\u201d Steven Heller, co-chairman of the design department at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and a former senior art director of The New York Times Book Review, said in an interview. \u201cHe took the complex, made it personal and turned it into something universal.\u201dMr. Cardo\u2019s illustration of a hammer crushing rocks inside a political prisoner\u2019s head accompanied A. M. Rosenthal\u2019s column about a Soviet prison camp in the Ural Mountains. His ratty-looking \u201cTrojan pig\u201d illustrated a piece about the \u201cdemanding, ceaseless and pivotal\u201d toll of campaign fund-raising written by John Frederick Martin, who managed Senator Al Gore\u2019s bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.Not everything he created fot The Times was used. In 1988, he was asked to illustrate an Op-Ed article about how few Medals of Honor had been awarded to black soldiers who fought heroically in the Korean War. He produced a bracing black-and-white sketch of a Ku Klux Klansman pointing outward, mimicking Uncle Sam\u2019s pose in the \u201cI Want You\u201d recruiting poster from World War I, as a reflection of racist attitudes in the armed forces.That illustration was turned down, said Jerelle Kraus, a former Times Op-Ed page art director who was married to Mr. Cardo from 1990 to 1998.Mr. Cardo balanced his black-and-white illustrations for The Times with more elaborate and more colorful ones that appeared elsewhere.To depict the toll of air pollution for Institutional Investor magazine, he painted the Earth in faded green and blue hues, wrapped in a gas mask. As a tribute to the Argentine citizens who had been \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the country\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s and \u201980s, he painted a poster of a malevolent-looking Army figure with a chest full of colorful decorative ribbons upon which tiny skulls dangled.For Time magazine, he created a Statue of Liberty whose crown was arrayed with warheads.And recently, for Clar\u00edn, he dressed President Trump in a sombrero through which a raging fire can be seen.\u201cIn Cardo\u2019s work, nothing is na\u00efve,\u201d Mercedes Perez Bergliaffa, an art critic for Clar\u00edn, wrote in 2009 when an exhibition of Mr. Cardo\u2019s work was shown at Teatro Argentino de La Plata in Buenos Aires. She added that he \u201cmakes up works with shrewd insight and synthesis, forming a junction area, both at a conceptual and formal level.\u201dSome of Mr. Cardo\u2019s earlier works were painted in oils, to which he added fabric, lace and plaster of Paris to create various textures. Later on, he created dramatic illustrations with ink and acrylic paint that he altered with digital tools like Photoshop.\u201cPhotoshop has allowed me to get closer to what I consider reality: the permanent transit (mutation, imbrication) of the images within the psyche,\u201d he said in an interview with Artefacto magazine in 2010. \u201cI would like to capture that permanently changing reality in my work, where past and present are interconnected.\u201dHoracio Fidel Cardo was born on May 20, 1944, in Temperley, in the province of Buenos Aires. His father, Juan, was a railroad executive, and his mother, Blanca Esther (Badde) de Cardo, was a homemaker. When he was 7, he asked his parents if he could study painting.\u201cSome years later, I began to make newspapers for my schoolmates,\u201d he said in an interview on his website. \u201cI used to create the headlines out of bottle cork cuttings (which I also used as stamps), I used to type the text with my father\u2019s typewriter, and I drew the images.\u201dHe never went to college, but at 21 he was hired by the book publisher Compa\u00f1ia General Fabril Editora, where one of his first assignments was to illustrate a new edition of the book \u201cEl Compadrito,\u201d by the Argentine writers Jorge Luis Borges and Silvina Bullrich.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018He later worked as a humorist for a newspaper, the art director for a direct sales company, and a freelance artist, before being hired in 1979 by Clar\u00edn, which served as his base for decades.In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughters, Nuria, Ivana, Samanta and Sabrina Cardo; two grandchildren; and his sister, Edith Dodds. His marriage to Silvia Arenales, like his marriage to Ms. Kraus, ended in divorce.Mr. Cardo was also a serious chess player who wrote books on the game\u2019s strategy under a pseudonym and wrote and illustrated, under his own name, \u201cThe Story of Chess\u201d (1998), a fairy tale for children that The Orlando Sentinel called \u201can original way of introducing a provocative game to young readers.\u201dAnd his distaste for Sigmund Freud, whom he described as greedy and dangerous, led him to create a series of critical and sometimes grotesque paintings and illustrations, one of which shows Freud as a switch preparing to send electroshock to the helmeted heads of four faceless patients. His anti-Freud work was exhibited at the Recoleta Cultural Center in Buenos Aires in 2009 and adapted into a companion book, \u201cSigmund Fraud and Psychoanalysis.\u201d\u201cI am psychoanalyzing Freud and psychoanalysis,\u201d Mr. Cardo said in \u201cPsychomigrations,\u201d a film by Tzachi Schiff about the exhibition. \u201cIf he could psychoanalyze the world and art, art could psychoanalyze him and his theories with equal authority.\u201dAdvertisement"}
