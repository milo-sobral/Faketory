{"id": "\u2018Tell Your Boss\u2019: Recording Is Seen to Link Saudi Crown Prince More Strongly to Khashoggi Killing", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Julian E. Barnes, Eric Schmitt and David D. KirkpatrickWASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated last month, a member of the kill team instructed a superior over the phone to \u201ctell your boss,\u201d believed to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, that the operatives had carried out their mission, according to three people familiar with a recording of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing collected by Turkish intelligence.The recording, shared last month with the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, is seen by intelligence officials as some of the strongest evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist whose death prompted an international outcry.While the prince was not mentioned by name, American intelligence officials believe \u201cyour boss\u201d was a reference to Prince Mohammed. Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, one of 15 Saudis dispatched to Istanbul to confront Mr. Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate there, made the phone call and spoke in Arabic, the people said.Turkish intelligence officers have told American officials they believe that Mr. Mutreb, a security officer who frequently traveled with Prince Mohammed, was speaking to one of the prince\u2019s aides. While translations of the Arabic may differ, the people briefed on the call said Mr. Mutreb also said to the aide words to the effect of \u201cthe deed was done.\u201d\u201cA phone call like that is about as close to a smoking gun as you are going to get,\u201d said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt is pretty incriminating evidence.\u201dTurkish officials have said that the audio does not conclusively implicate Prince Mohammed, and American intelligence and other government officials have cautioned that however compelling the recording may be, it is still not irrefutable evidence of his involvement in the death of Mr. Khashoggi.John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, said that while he had not listened to the tape, he had been told it did not directly implicate Prince Mohammed. \u201cThat\u2019s not the conclusion that I think the people who heard it have come to,\u201d Mr. Bolton told reporters on Wednesday at a briefing in Singapore.Even if Mr. Mutreb believed the killing was ordered by the crown prince, for example, he may have had an inaccurate understanding of the origins of the order. Prince Mohammed is not specifically named on the recording, and intelligence officials do not have ironclad certainty that Mr. Mutreb was referring to him.In a statement on Monday, Saudi officials denied that the crown prince \u201chad any knowledge whatsoever\u201d of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Referring to Mr. Mutreb\u2019s instructions to \u201ctell your boss,\u201d the Saudi statement said that Turkey had \u201callowed our intelligence services to hear recordings, and at no moment was there any reference to the mentioned phrase\u201d in the recordings.The Turks may possess multiple recordings, including surveillance of telephone calls, and the Turkish authorities may have shared the audio only selectively.A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.The call was part of a recording that Turkish officials played for Ms. Haspel during her visit in October to Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, but they did not allow her to bring it back to the United States. On Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey announced that his government had shared the audio with Saudi Arabia, the United States and other Western allies.But while Turkish officials have played the recording for American and other intelligence agencies and provided transcripts, the Turks have not handed over the recording for independent analysis, according to Turkish officials.Turkey shared evidence from the case with \u201ca large number of friendly nations,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Erdogan, Fahrettin Altun, said on Monday. Reacting to French criticism of Turkey\u2019s handling of the case, Mr. Altun said that the Turkish government had played an audio recording for French intelligence officials and given them transcripts.\u201cLet us not forget that this case would have been already covered up had it not been for Turkey\u2019s determined efforts,\u201d Mr. Altun said.The growing evidence that Prince Mohammed was involved in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi is certain to intensify pressure on the White House, which appeared intent on relying on a lack of concrete proof of his involvement to preserve its relationship with the crown prince. Prince Mohammed has fostered a close relationship with the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and the Trump administration has turned Saudi Arabia into Washington\u2019s most crucial Arab partner.Some Trump advisers have argued that they would need indisputable evidence of Prince Mohammed\u2019s involvement in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing before they would punish him or the kingdom more harshly. Turkish officials have said the recording contains evidence of a premeditated killing, in which Saudi agents quickly strangled Mr. Khashoggi and methodically dismembered his body with a bone saw.The administration, according to current and former officials, is hoping that making some modest moves on sanctions and curtailing support for the Saudi war effort in Yemen will satisfy critics, including those on Capitol Hill.But the shift in power in Congress, where Democrats take control of the House in January, is also increasing pressure on the administration to take more punitive action. The C.I.A. and other intelligence officials were set to brief Congress this week, and congressional leaders will press Ms. Haspel for her assessment of Prince Mohammed\u2019s culpability.Mr. Trump himself has suggested more information would be coming out. \u201cI\u2019ll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday at the White House. \u201cI am forming a very strong opinion.\u201dSigns of a hardening stance within the administration are emerging. The State Department issued a tough statement on Sunday saying that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had told Prince Mohammed in a phone call that \u201cthe United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable.\u201dSaudi officials planned to release their own inquiry in the coming days, but Turkey\u2019s revelation that they and Western officials also have the transcripts of the recordings could force the Saudis to scramble before any presentation they planned to make.Even without definitive proof, intelligence agencies had already concluded that only Prince Mohammed could have ordered the operation to kill Mr. Khashoggi, given the personal character of his governance and the depth of his control over the kingdom. Evidence from the tape also showed that Mr. Khashoggi was killed soon after he entered the room of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where the security team was waiting for him, further proof that the killing was planned, according to people briefed on the intelligence.Current and former intelligence officials insisted that it is rare that all of the pieces of a complex puzzle like Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing would ever be available. Intelligence, according to a former official, simply does not work like a spy thriller or television cop show where a case turns on a crystal-clear recording.Investigators were unlikely to collect a piece of evidence that incontrovertibly links the crown prince to the killing, said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is set to lead the House Intelligence Committee next year.\u201cYou are not going to have any of the people who carried out the murder speak openly about who they got their orders from or who is in the loop on it,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview. \u201cThat is not realistic to expect.\u201dThe absence of direct evidence does not prevent the intelligence community from laying responsibility at Prince Mohammed\u2019s feet. An intelligence assessment includes an agency\u2019s best judgment on what happened based on the available facts and experience of officials.Mr. Schiff promised that when he takes charge of the Intelligence Committee, he will investigate Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing and examine Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions more broadly in the Middle East, including its military campaign in Yemen, which has prompted a humanitarian crisis.\u201cWe need to do our own due diligence, we need to make sure we are getting good intelligence, and we need to make sure the administration doesn\u2019t misrepresent to the country what foreign actors are doing,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.Nonetheless, current and former officials said they do not expect Mr. Trump to drop his support for Prince Mohammed.\u201cThe Trump family and the president have built up such an overwhelming reliance on the crown prince that the relationship is now, in their view, too big to fail,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.Policymakers \u2014 not Ms. Haspel or Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence \u2014 will decide what sort of relationship to have with Prince Mohammed and what punishment Saudi Arabia should face for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, current and former officials said.Julian E.
