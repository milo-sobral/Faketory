{"id": "The Internet Will Be the Death of Us", "paragraph": "Supported byIt casts rogue grievances as legitimate obsessions and gives prejudices the shimmer of ideals. By Frank BruniOpinion ColumnistNora Ephron once wrote a brilliant essay about the trajectory of her and many other people\u2019s infatuations with email, from the thrill of discovering this speedy new way of keeping in touch to the hell of not being able to turn it off.I\u2019ve come to feel that way about the whole of the internet.What a glittering dream of expanded knowledge and enhanced connection it was at the start. What a nightmare of manipulated biases and metastasized hate it has turned into.Before he allegedly began mailing pipe bombs to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and others, Cesar Sayoc found encouragement online \u2014 maybe not in the form of explosives instructions, but in the sense that he could scream his resentments in a theater that did the opposite of repudiating them. It echoed them back. It validated and cultivated them. It took something dark and colored it darker still.\u201cBy the time he was arrested in Florida on Friday,\u201d The Times reported, \u201cSayoc appeared to fit the all-too-familiar profile of a modern extremist, radicalized online and sucked into a vortex of partisan furor.\u201dRobert Bowers, accused of murdering 11 Jewish Americans in Pittsburgh the morning after Sayoc\u2019s arrest, stoked his madness and nurtured his bloody fantasies in that same online vortex. While Sayoc carved out ugly niches on Facebook and Twitter, Bowers found even safer harbor for his racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic passions on Gab, a two-year-old social network that has served as a nursery for white nationalists. There they congregated, commiserated and riled up one another with an unfiltered efficiency that simply doesn\u2019t exist offline.It was on the internet, with its privacy and anonymity, that Dylann Roof researched white supremacy and formulated his evil conviction that violence was necessary. He then went into a historic church in Charleston, S.C., and fatally shot nine African-American parishioners in June 2015.It was on the internet \u2014 on Facebook, to be exact \u2014 that Alek Minassian posted a pledge of allegiance to the \u201cincel rebellion,\u201d which refers to the resentments of \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d men who can\u2019t interest the women around them in sex. He then used a van to mow down and kill 10 people in Toronto in April.Enclaves of the internet warped the worldviews of all of these men, convincing them of the primacy and purity of their rage. Most of us had never heard the term \u201cincel\u201d before the Toronto massacre. But it was the indelible centerpiece of Minassian\u2019s life.Most of us were unfamiliar with HIAS, the shorthand for a Jewish group that resettles refugees. But those initials dominated Bowers\u2019s anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. And that reflects the internet\u2019s power to cast rogue grievances as legitimate obsessions and give prejudices the shimmer of ideals.Technology has always been a coin with two sides: potential and peril. That\u2019s what Mary Shelley explored in \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d which is celebrating its 200th birthday this year, and it has been the main theme of science fiction ever since.The internet is the technology paradox writ more monstrous than ever. It\u2019s a nonpareil tool for learning, roving and constructive community-building. But it\u2019s unrivaled, too, in the spread of lies, narrowing of interests and erosion of common cause. It\u2019s a glorious buffet, but it pushes individual users toward only the red meat or just the kale. We\u2019re ridiculously overfed and ruinously undernourished.It creates terrorists. But well shy of that, it sows enmity by jumbling together information and misinformation to a point where there\u2019s no discerning the real from the Russian.Don\u2019t take it from me. Take it from a Silicon Valley giant whose wares depend on our internet addiction. Speaking at a conference in Brussels, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, warned, \u201cPlatforms and algorithms that promised to improve our lives can actually magnify our worst human tendencies.\u201d\u201cRogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false,\u201d he added.This was a week ago \u2014 before Sayoc\u2019s arrest, before Bowers\u2019s rampage, before Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, won Brazil\u2019s presidential election. As The Times reported, pro-Bolsonaro forces apparently tried to hurt his opponents and help him by flooding WhatsApp, the messaging application owned by Facebook, \u201cwith a deluge of political content that gave wrong information on voting locations and times.\u201d That same Times article noted that a search for the word \u201cJews\u201d on the photo-sharing site Instagram on Monday led to 11,696 posts with the hashtag \u201c#jewsdid911,\u201d insanely blaming them for the attacks that brought down the World Trade Center, along with similarly grotesque images and videos that demonized Jews. Anti-Semitism may be ancient, but this delivery system for it is entirely modern.And utterly terrifying. I don\u2019t know exactly how we square free speech and free expression \u2014 which are paramount \u2014 with a better policing of the internet, but I\u2019m certain that we need to approach that challenge with more urgency than we have mustered so far.
