{"id": "Parts of America Are Still Struggling Economically. They Don\u2019t Matter Much in the Midterms. ", "paragraph": "Supported byThe most competitive districts in the race for control of the House are disproportionately prosperous \u2014 and their economies aren\u2019t doing much to lift Republicans.By Jim Tankersley and Ben CasselmanWith just days to go before the midterm elections, President Trump is making an economic appeal to well-off suburban voters: Elect Republicans, the president warns in tweets and a new national ad, or kiss the good economic times goodbye.That appears to be the right audience for a closing pitch, but it may not pay off as the president hopes. The competitive districts that will decide control of the House are richer and more economically vibrant than the country as a whole. But there is little evidence that the thriving economies in those districts are buoying Republican candidates enough to guarantee victories against well-funded Democratic challengers.The concentration of battlegrounds in prosperous areas could have important policy implications for the next Congress, with swing-district representatives more concerned with preserving their region\u2019s own good fortunes than with helping large parts of the country that continue to lag economically.And it does not appear to be helping Republicans in their quest to retain control of the House, defying the hopes that party leaders expressed when they passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year without a single Democratic vote. Consider three Republican-held districts that the Cook Political Report ranks among the 73 most competitive races this fall: In California\u2019s 49th District, the typical household earned nearly $90,000 last year, a 9 percent jump from the year before. In Minnesota\u2019s Third District, the poverty rate is down to half the national average. In Virginia\u2019s 10th District, unemployment is at a rock bottom 2.6 percent, well below the national jobless rate of 3.7 percent.Republican candidates are trailing in all three races, with their Democratic rivals running at or near 50 percent, according to polls conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. To flip control of the chamber, Democrats must win 23 seats now held by Republicans. The most recent polls shows Democrats favored to win control of the House.Democrats have tried to use the economy against Mr. Trump, even though job creation and economic growth are strong. In competitive contests in well-off districts, Democratic candidates criticize Mr. Trump and Republicans about the rising costs of housing and health care as well as the inequity and long-term costs of the tax cuts.\u201cI see a lot of people who, if they vote with their pocketbook, and they\u2019ve maybe sided with Republicans because of that, they\u2019re taking another look\u201d this year, said Mike Levin, the Democratic candidate in California\u2019s 49th District, which includes a strip of coastline running from north of San Diego to the southern suburbs of Los Angeles. \u201cToday, I feel like, to the extent we\u2019ve seen gains, we\u2019re on a sugar high. And I have young kids \u2014 I know a lot about that.\u201dIt is possible, of course, that Republicans in tight races would be in even worse shape were it not for the strong economy. An analysis of polling data suggests Republican candidates are performing modestly better, relative to expectations based on their performances in past elections, in districts where the unemployment rate is lower or has fallen faster than in other districts. On a national level, the economy may be helping lift Mr. Trump's approval ratings, which, if historical patterns hold, could help Republicans avoid steeper losses in the midterm elections.But those effects are not nearly large enough to help Republicans avoid costly and contentious races in some of the most vibrant parts of the country, particularly in suburbs of high-performing metropolitan areas. \u201cThose are the places where the president is the most toxic, outside of urban areas,\u201d said Amy Walter, the national political editor of the Cook Report. \u201cIt\u2019s not about their pocketbook. It\u2019s about partisanship, and it\u2019s also about cultural issues.\u201dMoreover, many swing voters appear skeptical of Republican claims on the economy. Surveys have consistently found that independent voters are less sanguine about the economy than Republicans, and Mr. Trump\u2019s signature economic policies, such as last year\u2019s tax cut, poll poorly with that group. And women \u2014 including the suburban white women who are the target of recent Republican ads \u2014 report feeling significantly less positive about the economy than men, according to a recent survey conducted for The Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey.A study to be released this week by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank in Washington that advocates policies to help economically distressed parts of the country, finds that 28 of the 70 most competitive House districts this year rank as \u201cprosperous\u201d \u2014 the highest quintile \u2014 on the group\u2019s distressed communities index. Another 15 districts rank in the next quintile, \u201ccomfortable.\u201d Those districts have higher incomes and faster job and business growth than other areas.Only six of the most competitive districts rank as \u201cdistressed,\u201d the lowest quintile in the index.As a group, the 70 most competitive districts have not seen their incomes grow more, or their unemployment rates drop faster, than the rest of the country since Mr. Trump took office. But they began the Trump era in better shape than the rest of the country.In 2017, the median household income in a typical competitive district was just over $66,000, according to the Census Bureau. For the typical noncompetitive district, it was just under $57,000. The median income for a \u201cprosperous\u201d competitive district was more than $73,000. Those districts frequently run through the suburbs of large cities in high-income states. The \u201cprosperous\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d list includes four districts in California and three each in New Jersey, Minnesota, Florida and Texas. It also includes Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, one of the most prosperous in the nation according to the Economic Innovation Group rankings, where the incumbent, Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, is trailing badly in the polls.The broad universe of competitive seats is wealthier and whiter than the nation as a whole, the Economic Innovation Group analysis finds. But in a narrower group of seats that could hand Democrats control of the House by themselves \u2014 those that Cook ranks as \u201ctoss up\u201d or \u201clean Democratic\u201d \u2014 the relatively high-earning population includes a larger share of immigrants than the typical district. The toss-up districts \u201care by and large pretty dynamic places, where the status quo is working rather well,\u201d John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group, said in an interview. \u201cThings like globalization and immigration aren\u2019t things to be feared there. They\u2019re woven into the fabric.\u201dThat is certainly the case in west Houston and its suburbs, where the incumbent, Representative John Culberson, a Republican, is running neck and neck with Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a Democrat, in the toss-up Seventh Congressional District. More than a quarter of the population was born abroad. More than half is nonwhite. Mr. Culberson is leaning into the economy in his campaign. He said in an interview that his constituents, no matter where they were born, wanted a fiscal conservative to continue \u201cthe obviously successful economic policies\u201d that have contributed to the growth of the area and its oil and gas companies.\u201cVoters in my district understand that I\u2019m the right person in the right place at the right time to keep the economy growing,\u201d Mr. Culberson said, \u201cbecause I always support tax cuts, I always support lightening the regulatory load, I always support the oil and gas industry.\u201dIn television advertisements, Ms. Fletcher has attacked Mr. Culberson largely on health care. Her first ad promoted Houston\u2019s innovative economy and her work with businesses there. Those issues \u2014 and the nature of the House battlegrounds \u2014 stand in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s focus in the weeks before the midterm elections, which has lingered on warnings about immigrants, particularly those in a caravan heading north from Central America. The warnings may do more to help rally conservatives in Mr. Trump\u2019s base in many conservative states that are home to contentious Senate races, including North Dakota and Missouri. Mr. Trump\u2019s new $6 million national television ad appears targeted more to the suburban voters who will decide control of the House. It features a woman in a leafy home, watching her young daughter play violin and remembering the aftermath of the recession. The woman votes Republican; her daughter appears to grow up to be a concert violinist. \u201cThings are getting better,\u201d the ad reads in closing. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back.\u201dMs. Walter of the Cook Report said the ad might struggle to break through \u2014 against Mr. Trump\u2019s own messaging.\u201cO.K., that\u2019s a nice ad, but he\u2019s spending all day talking about birthright citizenship and sending troops to the border,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich one should we be watching?\u201dJim Tankersley covers economic and tax policy.
