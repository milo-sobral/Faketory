ChowA gunman fatally shot two people at a supermarket in Kentucky on Wednesday afternoon before an armed onlooker fired at him, prompting him to flee, the police said.The authorities identified the gunman on Thursday as Gregory Bush, 51. He was arrested a short time after the shooting near the Kroger where it happened in Jeffersontown, a suburb of Louisville, Chief Sam Rogers of the Jeffersontown police said at a news conference on Wednesday night.Mr. Bush was charged with two counts of murder and 10 counts of endangerment in the first degree, and was being held at the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections, the authorities said.The victims were identified as Vicki Lee Jones, 67, and Maurice E. Stallard, 69, who was the father of a prominent city official in Louisville. They were both black, the police said, and Mr. Bush is white; while the police said they did not know of a motive, the son of a witness said his father heard the gunman making a racist remark.\u201cI am just sick and heartbroken and quite angry,\u201d Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville said on Thursday. \u201cThis one is especially painful.\u201dMr. Stallard\u2019s daughter, Kellie Watson, works for the mayor as the chief equity officer in Louisville, he said.\u201cI\u2019m angry because it seems like none of these murders or massacres hit close enough for anyone in a position to do something about this madness,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.At a court hearing on Thursday morning, a judge ordered Mr. Bush to be held on $5 million bond. Mr. Bush told the judge that he was unemployed and could not afford a lawyer.Steve Zinninger told Wave 3 News that his father confronted the gunman at one point during the encounter, brandishing a gun of his own and telling him that he would not shoot if the gunman did not shoot. Mr. Zinninger said the gunman told his father, \u201cWhites don\u2019t kill whites,\u201d and moved on.In a statement, Kroger said it was \u201cshocked and saddened by the shooting.\u201d\u201cThanks to the quick response of the local Police Department, the suspect was apprehended and our store is secure,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are cooperating with law enforcement and assisting with their investigation. Our store is closed and will reopen after the investigation concludes.\u201dThe police in Jeffersontown said they received reports of shots fired at the supermarket around 3 p.m. Wednesday and quickly sent officers to the scene.Investigators said that after Mr. Bush entered the supermarket, he fired multiple rounds at a male victim; he then exited and fired multiple rounds at a female victim, whom he encountered in the parking lot. Both shooting victims were declared dead at the scene, Chief Rogers said.Mr. Bush then encountered \u201can armed citizen,\u201d who \u201cengaged the suspect with gunfire in the parking lot,\u201d the chief said. He did not provide any additional information about that man. The gunman then ran, but he was soon caught by the police on a main thoroughfare nearby.Chief Rogers said multiple law enforcement agencies, including federal authorities, were assisting with the investigation.\u201cAt this point we\u2019re looking into all factors related to this shooting,\u201d he said.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and one of Kentucky\u2019s senators, said Wednesday that he and his staff were \u201cclosely monitoring the situation.\u201d\u201cAs we continue to learn more about the events that took place, Elaine and I ask the entire Louisville community to join us in praying for the victims and their families,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to his wife, Elaine Chao.In an interview with the local television station WDRB, Kathy Mayhall said that she was at the store\u2019s checkout when she heard \u201c\u2018bang, bang, bang, bang\u2019 really, really loud.\u201d Everyone looked at each other, she said, and then the gunfire continued.Ms. Mayhall said the shooting inside the store occurred in its \u201cback right corner\u201d and she was \u201cmaybe eight aisles away.\u201d\u201cWe knew it was a loud noise, but the way it echoed in that building \u2014 I didn\u2019t really realize\u201d a shooting had taken place, she said. She noted that one is not usually \u201cthinking you\u2019re going to hear a gun in a grocery store.\u201dAt least one eyewitness\u2019s account differed from that of the police.Eric Deacon, who was also shopping on Wednesday, told Wave 3 News that he heard gunfire and took cover on the ground. A man ran past him and out the door of the Kroger, he said, as another man chased him.Mr. Deacon told The Courier Journal of Louisville that the gunman had a \u201cblank stare\u201d on his face as he came around the corner.The pair of armed men then began firing at each other in the parking lot, which is when the female victim was hit, Mr. Deacon said.\u201cShe was right up in the front of the parking lot,\u201d he told the station. \u201cI hollered out and I said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m an E.M.T. Let me get out here and try to help this woman.\u2019 They ushered me out, and I\u2019m getting ready to start C.P.R. on this lady. And I looked at her and I was like, \u2018Fellas, she\u2019s gone. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u2019\u201dIn a statement issued Wednesday night, the Jeffersontown Police Department said that the crime scene had been cleared, but that the supermarket would remain closed until Friday morning.Sandra E.
