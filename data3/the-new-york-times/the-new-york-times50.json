{"id": "Standing \u2018Against White Supremacy,\u2019 G.O.P. Campaign Chief Rebukes Steve King", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Catie EdmondsonWASHINGTON \u2014 As Pittsburgh began burying the victims of Saturday\u2019s synagogue massacre, the head of the House Republican campaign arm all but jettisoned Representative Steve King of Iowa from the House Republican Conference, declaring, \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.\u201dThe highly unusual rebuke by Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, came a week before the midterm elections \u2014 but after years of incendiary and racially charged comments by Mr. King, capped in recent days by his endorsement of a white nationalist running for mayor of Toronto and a meeting with Austrian white nationalists, which he funded through a trip to visit concentration camps.Mr. King is also locked in the toughest re-election fight of his eight-term House career.\u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate,\u201d Mr. Stivers wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior.\u201dMr. King fired back with a statement of his own, affirming that Americans of all races and \u201cnational origins-legal immigrants & natural born citizens\u201d are created equal. He blamed attacks on him as \u201corchestrated by nasty, desperate, and dishonest fake news,\u201d aided by complicit \u201cEstablishment Never Trumpers.\u201dThe public censure is the latest downturn for Mr. King, whose lengthy history of making racially charged remarks has been subjected to closer scrutiny after the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. After liberal activists on social media lobbied some of Mr. King\u2019s corporate donors to cut ties with the representative, the Midwestern dairy giant Land O\u2019Lakes withdrew its support, saying in a statement that it wants its \u201ccontributions to be a positive force for good.\u201dThe math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.New polling from Iowa\u2019s Fourth Congressional District indicates that he is in a statistical tie with his Democratic opponent, J. D. Scholten, a former baseball player and a first-time candidate, who has significantly outraised him. Iowa Republicans are already at risk of losing two other House seats.Over nearly 16 years, Mr. King has evolved from a stalwart conservative to a vocal opponent of immigration to the edge of white supremacy. He compared immigrants to dogs and said young migrants had \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d because they were hauling in bales of marijuana. He once tweeted a political cartoon depicting President Barack Obama wearing a turban.Two weeks ago, he endorsed Faith Goldy, who has previously recited the 14-word manifesto used by neo-Nazis, in her race for Toronto mayor. And in the spring, he retweeted an anti-immigration message from a prominent Nazi sympathizer who has described himself as an admirer of Hitler. (Mr. King defended that decision, adding, \u201cI will retweet the devil if the devil tweets, \u2018I Love Jesus.\u2019 It\u2019s the message, not the messenger.\u201d)But the tipping point may have come last week when news reports revealed that Mr. King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party associated with neo-Nazi movements while he was on a trip to Holocaust sites that was funded by a Holocaust memorial charity, From the Depths.His local newspaper, The Sioux City Journal, which had endorsed Mr. King in previous races, instead endorsed Mr. Scholten.\u201cEach time King immerses himself in controversy, he holds up this district to ridicule and marginalizes himself within the legislative body he serves,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editorial board wrote, \u201cneither of which provides benefit to Iowans who live and work here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
