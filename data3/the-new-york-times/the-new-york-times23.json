{"id": "\u2018Blackface\u2019 Remarks by Megyn Kelly Lead to Rift With NBC", "paragraph": "Supported byBy John Koblin and Michael M. GrynbaumMegyn Kelly struggled on Wednesday to contain a growing crisis over her racially insensitive remarks during a \u201cToday\u201d show broadcast, statements that propelled longstanding tensions between the former Fox News anchor and her NBC News colleagues into public view.Several of Ms. Kelly\u2019s fellow NBC stars denounced her for wondering aloud, on-air during \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d on Tuesday, why it was inappropriate for white people to dress in blackface on Halloween.On Wednesday\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, the NBC anchor Craig Melvin called her comments \u201cracist and ignorant,\u201d and Al Roker, the usually genial weatherman, said that Ms. Kelly \u201cowes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country.\u201d The MSNBC anchor Jacob Soboroff wrote on Twitter that her remarks were \u201cvile.\u201dMs. Kelly issued a tearful apology of her own at the top of her 9 a.m. broadcast, telling viewers, \u201cI\u2019m Megyn Kelly and I want to begin with two words \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Hours later, her boss, the NBC News chairman Andrew Lack, criticized her comments at a private gathering of network employees \u2014 and offered no praise for her attempts to redeem herself.\u201cThere is no other way to put this, but I condemn those remarks,\u201d Mr. Lack said at a midday staff meeting held in the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d studios in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cThere is no place on our air or in this workplace for them.\u201d[Update: \u2018Megyn Kelly Today\u2019 show is cancelled in wake of Kelly\u2019s \u2018Blackface\u2019 comments.\u2019]His comments were seen within NBC as a stinging rebuke, according to interviews with four people close to the network who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations.Even before this week, the future of Ms. Kelly\u2019s show was up in the air. During a meeting this month, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Lack discussed a possible winding-down of her portion of the \u201cToday\u201d show by the end of the year, according to two people briefed on the conversation. And Ms. Kelly has expressed among friends her dissatisfaction with its top news executives.Late Wednesday, Ms. Kelly and her Hollywood talent agency, Creative Artists Agency, ended their relationship, according to two people informed of the decision.With a reported annual salary of $17 million and the NBC hype machine in full swing, Ms. Kelly, 47, arrived at 30 Rockefeller Plaza last spring hoping to become the first Fox News personality to successfully leap to the gentler realm of morning network TV.Instead, she has struggled to attract viewers and offended celebrity guests (notably the actress Jane Fonda). She also alienated some \u201cToday\u201d show colleagues with her coverage of in-house harassment scandals involving Matt Lauer, the former \u201cToday\u201d anchor, and Tom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.On Tuesday\u2019s show, her comments \u2014 in which she suggested to her guests that, when she was a child, dressing in blackface was accepted \u201cas long as you were dressing up as a character\u201d \u2014 left many NBC News employees stunned and exasperated. At a post-broadcast meeting, members of Ms. Kelly\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d team expressed discomfort with what she had said on-air, according to several people briefed on the discussion, although Ms. Kelly was not present.Her remarks came during a round-table discussion of how, as she put it, \u201cthe costume police are cracking down\u201d on Halloween outfits. \u201cYou do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cBack when I was a kid, that was O.K., as long as you were dressing up as a character.\u201dShe added that she was perplexed by the criticism of Luann de Lesseps, a cast member of \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York\u201d who was criticized for dressing up as Diana Ross, complete with an outsize Afro wig. \u201cPeople said that that was racist, and I don\u2019t know, I felt like, who doesn\u2019t love Diana Ross?\u201d Ms. Kelly said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with the number of people that we\u2019re offending just by being normal people.\u201dSeveral hours later, she emailed an apology to colleagues. \u201cThe history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent; the wounds too deep,\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a \u2018pc\u2019 kind of person \u2014 but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age.\u201d\u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d devoted segments to Ms. Kelly\u2019s remarks during its Tuesday and Wednesday editions. On Tuesday, the broadcast included a Fox News clip from 2013 in which Ms. Kelly weighed in on the race of Santa Claus. \u201cFor all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,\u201d she said. That same clip was shown again during Wednesday\u2019s 7 a.m. hour of \u201cToday.\u201dFor NBC News, the \u201cblackface\u201d flare-up was yet another headache.The news division has come under scrutiny for what its executives may have known about the workplace behavior of Mr. Lauer before he was fired in 2017 after allegations of sexual harassment were made against him. In May, an NBC investigation cleared network executives of any wrongdoing in the matter, but drew criticism because it was conducted by in-house counsel, rather than an outside law firm.Mr. Brokaw was also accused of making unwanted advances \u2014 claims that the anchor denied. And in September, the journalist Ronan Farrow and his NBC producer, Rich McHugh, accused the network of impeding a report about Harvey Weinstein and sexual assault, an investigation that Mr. Farrow continued at The New Yorker. (NBC said it did nothing wrong.)Ms. Kelly covered each of those episodes extensively on her morning show. Last month, she suggested on the air that outside investigators should look into the matter of NBC\u2019s handling of the Farrow story.On-air errors, even contentious ones, can sometimes be smoothed over if an anchor has big ratings. But in her first year at NBC, Ms. Kelly\u2019s portion of \u201cToday\u201d has averaged 2.4 million viewers, a drop of nearly 400,000 from the same hour\u2019s average before her arrival, according to Nielsen. Ms. Kelly has also trailed a rival morning program, \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan,\u201d by a wide margin.Her \u201cblackface\u201d remarks on Tuesday could further complicate her job. A Netflix spokeswoman said on Wednesday that cast members of the political drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d had decided to pull out of a scheduled appearance on \u201cMegyn Kelly Today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
