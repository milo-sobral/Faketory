{"id": "These Americans Are Done With Politics", "paragraph": "Supported bynews analysisThe Exhausted Majority needs a break. By Sabrina TaverniseMs. Tavernise is a national correspondent for The Times.As the country catches its breath after one of the most acrimonious midterm elections in years, it would be easy to conclude that all of America is hopelessly divided \u2014 a land where two angry tribes are at each other\u2019s throats and everybody thinks about politics all the time.But the reality is far less extreme.A deep new study of the American electorate, \u201cHidden Tribes,\u201d concludes that two out of three Americans are far more practical than that narrative suggests. Most do not see their lives through a political lens, and when they have political views the views are far less rigid than those of the highly politically engaged, ideologically orthodox tribes.The study, an effort to understand the forces that drive political polarization, surveyed a representative group of 8,000 Americans. The nonpartisan organization that did it, More in Common, paints a picture of a society that is far more disengaged \u2014 and despairing over divisions \u2014 than it is divided. At its heart is a vast and often overlooked political middle that feels forgotten in the vitriol, as if the country has gone on without it. It calls that group the Exhausted Majority, a group that represented two-thirds of the survey.\u201cIt feels very lonely out here,\u201d said Jamie McDaniel, a 36-year-old home health care worker in Topeka, Kan., one of several people in the study who was interviewed for this article. \u201cEverybody is so right or left, and you\u2019re just kind of standing there in the middle saying, \u201cWhat happened?\u2019\u201dFor Ms. McDaniel, who works full time and is raising a young daughter, politics is not a hobby but an obligation to be endured \u2014 more dental appointment than ballgame. She does not know her friends\u2019 political persuasions, nor they hers, because it is not part of how they see themselves. Ms. McDaniel voted on Nov. 6, mostly for Democrats, in a church. But in an interview three days later, she said she had not checked to see who won.\u201cI prefer to be in the dark because of all of the hostility going on,\u201d she said.The study found that nearly half of the Exhausted Majority say they have not been politically active in the past year, compared with just 1 percent of the Progressive Activists and Devoted Conservatives, the two least flexible and most ideological of the seven political tribes identified in the study. Forty-one percent said they did not vote in 2016.The ugliness of politics has turned some people off.\u201cI\u2019m so upset, I feel physically ill,\u201d Marsha Newman, 66, a school counselor in Chapmanville, W.Va., said on a rainy Election Day morning. \u201cJust the ugliness of it all. It\u2019s so heartbreaking that all we can do is bring each other down and cut into each other. I feel like I\u2019m going to cry.\u201dThe highly politically engaged tribes may have seized on the midterm elections as a victory, but for the Exhausted Majority it merely perpetuated a hopeless stalemate.\u201cIt\u2019s like World War I, where you\u2019re pushing each other back and forth over the same quarter-mile of ground and nothing happens,\u201d said Christopher Kershaw, 39, a logistics manager in rural New Jersey. The study found that members of the Exhausted Majority are more likely than those on the far ends of the political spectrum to be women, less likely to have a college or graduate degree, less likely to be white and more likely to be young. It concluded that four in five Americans believe that the country has a problem with \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d which many said made them feel bad but also bewildered \u2014 a set of rules they had not learned to decode.It also found that many in the Exhausted Majority tend to see both sides.\u201cMy husband would tell you I\u2019m a devil\u2019s advocate,\u201d said Mary Linda Vetter, 71, a retired teaching assistant in Woodhull, N.Y. \u201cI\u2019m always looking at the other side of the coin.\u201dDuring the 2016 campaign, Ms. Vetter\u2019s husband would watch the conservative pundit Glenn Beck and then accuse her of not caring because she had little interest. In fact, she cares a lot. Her whole life, she has voted and volunteered \u2014 at her church and at a local nursing home, visiting residents who did not have families. But she is uncomfortable with the culture of outrage and ideological conformity.\u201cI guess I would have to say that I\u2019m completely confused as to who is lying and who is telling the truth,\u201d Ms. Vetter said. \u201cI just feel helpless.\u201dPartisanship may be at a modern high, but that doesn\u2019t mean people are happy with their political choices. The study shows that most Americans have political tastes that are not uniform: They may lean toward one party, but they see things they like in both. Its findings suggest a deep hunger for political leaders who are practical and not tribal \u2014 who do not cast the world in starkly moral terms, but in bread-and-butter policy terms.The approval of several ballot initiatives long supported by Democrats but opposed by Republicans in Republican or Republican-leaning states last week might have signaled the power of the Exhausted Majority to break partisan gridlock. Those included a measure in Florida that re-enfranchised former felons; measures in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah that expanded Medicaid; and minimum-wage measures in Arkansas and Missouri.Yascha Mounk, a political scientist at Harvard University, said the influence of the Exhausted Majority might play out in 2020 in another way: Fatigue with the noise of politics is so deep, he said, that it might strengthen the chances of candidates offering to be less nakedly partisan.\u201cFor the last two years it\u2019s been impossible to go to a bar on a Monday night and not have to talk about politics,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Americans are sick of that. I think you can win in 2020 by promising that if you become president, people can go back to talking about football.\u201dThe study describes a Democratic base that looks far less like the progressive left and more like the American mainstream. Elizabeth Damon, 54, a veterinarian in Eagle Point, Ore., is a registered Democrat because \u201cI really don\u2019t think anybody should be able to tell me what to do with my own body.\u201d But she also thinks the party has drifted too far left, and in 2016 she voted for Donald Trump.\u201cMore than anything, they just want to pick fights,\u201d Dr. Damon said of Democrats. The Senate confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was one example, she said. William Baltimore, 55, a mail clerk in a bank in Overland Park, Kan., who usually votes Democrat, said Mr. Trump repels him.But on immigration, Mr. Baltimore prefers Mr. Trump. The Democrats \u201care just willing to accept anything, anybody and anyone, and that doesn\u2019t fly good with me,\u201d he said.Bruce Bell, 32, of Whitmore Lake, Mich., voted Democratic his whole life, including twice for Barack Obama, but has drifted from the party, tired of what he said was progressive contempt.\u201cThe progressives, they just shut you down,\u201d said Mr. Bell, who works on electrical systems of semitrucks. \u201cYou are a complete idiot, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You don\u2019t have a college degree to even have an opinion on the matter.\u201dMr. Bell, who voted third-party in 2016, badly wants compromise, but he thinks the political system is uniquely unfit to give it. The effect is a souring on democracy itself.\u201cIt makes you feel that you are just not represented in government,\u201d he said, adding, \u201clike the actual interests of the people are almost irrelevant.\u201dMore than three in four Americans believe that our differences aren\u2019t so great that we can\u2019t work together. Mr. Bell is among them. The anger he sees is mostly on screens \u2014 not in his daily life.He still trick-or-treats with his neighbors and their children. They still wave to one another in the morning before work.\u201cPeople in my life, we can easily disagree on some controversial topic,\u201d Mr. Bell said, \u201cbut we are not at each other\u2019s throats, calling each other evil.\u201dSabrina Tavernise is a national correspondent for The Times.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram,Advertisement"}
