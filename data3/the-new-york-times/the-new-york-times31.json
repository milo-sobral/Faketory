{"id": "Microsoft\u2019s Earnings Surge, as Cloud Bet Continues to Pay Off", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Karen WeiseSEATTLE \u2014 Apple has its cash cow, the iPhone, which has made it the world\u2019s largest public company. Amazon transformed an array of industries, from logistics to the way consumers buy, to become the second largest. For Microsoft, which is gaining ground on Amazon, growth runs straight through the cloud.In the past several quarters, Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud offerings have grown by big leaps, helping push the company\u2019s market cap to about $785 billion. On Wednesday, the company reported that the fast growth had continued in the latest quarter, as part of an earnings statement that beat analyst expectations and the company\u2019s own guidance across every segment of its business.Microsoft\u2019s first-quarter revenue was up 19 percent over the previous year, to $29.1 billion. Net income rose 34 percent, to $8.8 billion.\u201cWe are seeing larger and longer-term customer commitments to the cloud,\u201d said Amy Hood, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Shares in the company rose as much as 4.6 percent in aftermarket trading, in response to the earnings. During market hours, shares had fallen more than 5 percent in a marketwide sell-off.\u201cIf you told an investor a few years ago that Microsoft is on the cusp of a $1 trillion market capitalization and could surpass Amazon, they\u2019d think you were crazy,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt speaks to how significant this cloud shift is, and what a strong hold Microsoft has on the cloud.\u201dAmazon all but created the idea of cloud computing after it first built out remote data centers to store information and run advanced tools on its own data. But Microsoft has been gaining ground fast in recent years, establishing itself as the second-strongest provider.When Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft largely depended on selling its Windows operating system on personal computers, even as smartphones were ascendant. He shifted the company to focus much more on its cloud computing business.The breakneck growth of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud offering, slowed more in the most recent quarter than some analysts had expected. It was up 76 percent, after several quarters of being up from 85 to 98 percent. And Azure may not even be profitable, said Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, as the company heavily invests engineering resources in new products and the construction of new data centers around the globe.But analysts and investors say the company is well positioned for the increasingly popular approach called \u201chybrid cloud,\u201d which lets enterprises, like companies or government agencies, use one set of tools to manage what they store both on their own servers and on shared space in the cloud.\u201cMicrosoft is unique in the sense that it has the ability to play in both environments,\u201d said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager in Seattle at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. \u201cLegacy customers are already working on Microsoft products, and it provides a level of continuity to transition to the cloud.\u201dIn a call with analysts, Mr. Nadella said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think of hybrid as some stopgap to move to the cloud,\u201d and that Microsoft was investing in building out its hybrid offerings.\u201cThis is a place where we are leading,\u201d he said.The company\u2019s year-over-year growth in server products and cloud services was 28 percent, which Ms. Hood said was a sign that the company was meeting customer demand. That makes it \u201cnot a challenging decision\u201d to invest heavily in the cloud business, she said. And the company has money to spend in part because the legacy Windows business is still lucrative.\u201cThey have been telegraphing that Azure\u2019s profitability is improving, and that is enough,\u201d Mr. Keirstead said. \u201cIt is probably the most amazing growth engine we have seen inside Microsoft since basically the origins of the Windows business.\u201dAnother key part of the cloud transition is how Microsoft moved its suite of Office programs from software to the cloud, called Office 365. The product\u2019s revenue was up 36 percent in the first quarter.\u201cIt\u2019s not as sexy Azure, but it\u2019s really important,\u201d said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cIt drives a lot of your profit.\u201dMr. Weiss said that once companies moved Office to the cloud, it was easier for Microsoft to sell them additional services, like video calls on Skype for Business or group chats on Microsoft Teams, a tool similar to the Slack messaging system.\u201cIf you can get someone to pay you 20 percent more by just switching on some functionality, that\u2019s great for you,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Aside from the core cloud business, Ms. Hood said, gaming revenue increased 44 percent, outperforming expectations as Microsoft expands its gaming platform.\u201cFortnite is a key component of that, but it\u2019s not the only contributor,\u201d she said, referring to a popular game.LinkedIn revenue also had higher-than-expected revenue, up 33 percent over the previous year, as engagement increased.\u201cRight now, it's like they are firing on all cylinders,\u201d Mr. Ives of Wedbush said. \"The biggest risk to the name is that expectations have increased.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a popular video game. It is Fortnite, not Fortnight.Follow Karen Weise on Twitter: @kyweise.Advertisement"}
