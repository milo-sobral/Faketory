{"id": "Review: Rowan Atkinson Returns in \u2018Johnny English Strikes Again\u2019", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Ben KenigsbergOn the evidence, Rowan Atkinson\u2019s secret agent character, Johnny English, has grown slightly less bumbling over the years, and so has the series. \u201cJohnny English Strikes Again\u201d has a few more laughs and far fewer cringes (and stereotypes) than the two films that preceded it.Plus it knows where to steal from. Watching it is like having a good time by proxy. The title evokes Peter Sellers\u2019s work in \u201cThe Pink Panther Strikes Again,\u201d and the moment when Johnny commandeers a student driver\u2019s car is an invitation to rewatch \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d which deployed a definitive version of that gag three decades ago.Johnny, who has been working as a schoolteacher, is summoned back into service after a cyberattack exposes Britain\u2019s top agents. Emma Thompson, as the hapless, put-upon prime minister \u2014 who bears more than a slight resemblance to Theresa May \u2014 adds some welcome dryness to an otherwise very broad movie.In the two funniest sequences, Atkinson shows off the physical elasticity he honed as Mr. Bean. In one, after mistakenly ingesting a mega-stimulant, he spends a night on the dance floor unwittingly and robotically evading assassination by a Russian spy (the former bond girl Olga Kurylenko). In the other, he takes a virtual reality tour of the home of a Silicon Valley mogul (Jake Lacy, channeling Elon Musk and perhaps a bit of Mark Zuckerberg) \u2014 and accidentally strays into the streets of London.The city, if not the country, should feel fine retiring Johnny again.Movie data powered by IMDb.comRated PG.
