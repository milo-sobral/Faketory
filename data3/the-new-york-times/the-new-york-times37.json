{"id": "She Helped Save Her Husband\u2019s Life With CPR, Then Gave Birth to Their Son", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Christina CaronAshley Goette of West St. Paul, Minn., is being compared to a superhero these days, and not just because she\u2019s a new mother. (Though her 22 hours of labor alone would qualify.) It\u2019s because in the span of four days, she not only gave birth to her first child, but also saved her husband\u2019s life.It all began last Tuesday, around 5 a.m., when Ms. Goette was awakened by her husband, Andrew. He seemed to be snoring. She nudged him and asked him to roll over. He didn\u2019t respond.Then she realized he wasn\u2019t snoring at all: He was gasping for air.Ms. Goette, 28, who works as a teacher\u2019s aide at an elementary school, called 911 and the dispatcher guided her in performing chest compressions, instructing her to move her husband to a hard surface. But she was 39 weeks pregnant, and though she tried, he wouldn\u2019t budge. She continued performing compressions on the bed. The gasping stopped. He was turning purple.\u201cI thought he for sure was dead,\u201d Ms. Goette said on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really had any time to process what was going on.\u201dAfter about 10 minutes, paramedics showed up and discovered he wasn\u2019t breathing and didn\u2019t have a pulse. They shocked his heart and rushed Mr. Goette, 28, to the hospital, where his outlook seemed uncertain.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t waking up and interacting with us, so that\u2019s always a concerning factor,\u201d Dr. Alex Teeters, a pulmonary and critical care physician at United Hospital in St. Paul, said on Wednesday.Soon, a team of doctors approached Ms. Goette with grim news: Initial testing suggested that Mr. Goette might have sustained severe brain damage.\u201cThose first 24 hours were harrowing for the family,\u201d Dr. Teeters said, and doctors prepared Ms. Goette \u201cfor the possibility that this might not be a good outcome.\u201dAs she recalled, \u201cthere was pretty much no question at that time that he was not coming home with me.\u201dThe hospital sedated Mr. Goette and began lowering his body temperature in what would be a daylong procedure to induce mild hypothermia and reduce damage to the brain.\u201cWhile they were doing that, it was the most terrifying thing to see,\u201d Ms. Goette said. \u201cHis body was just convulsing.\u201d The doctors administered a muscle relaxant to prevent involuntary movements.\u201cI would constantly be holding his hand over my stomach on the baby, and telling him: \u2018We have not had this baby yet. I\u2019m going to wait for you. You\u2019re going to be the first one to hold this baby. This is not happening until you\u2019re ready,\u2019\u201d Ms. Goette recalled.Then, on Wednesday, when the process ended and the sedation lifted, Mr. Goette began to move.A nurse asked him to open his eyes, and to everyone\u2019s surprise, he sat upright, scanning the faces of his family members.\u201cThe screams that were coming from his room and the cries were like nothing else,\u201d Ms. Goette said. \u201cNobody was expecting that \u2014 it was insane.\u201dHad Ms. Goette not acted as quickly as she did, Dr. Teeters said, her husband might not have recovered.\u201cMinutes can make a huge difference in situations like this,\u201d Dr. Teeters said.Mr. Goette later learned that he had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a rare condition also shared by his uncle that creates abnormal heart rhythms. It is even more rare for patients with this syndrome to go into cardiac arrest, Dr. Teeters said.The condition is caused by an extra electrical pathway between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers that is present from birth.Mr. Goette needed a procedure to destroy the tissue in his heart that was creating the improper pathways. But then, on Thursday, Ms. Goette started having contractions. Her blood pressure was rising. The procedure was postponed.She was in labor throughout the night and into Friday, but eventually hospital staff members urged her to consider a C-section. She agreed, and on Friday, Lennon was born.Mr. Goette was the first person to hold him.\u201cI tore open the hospital gown I had on and I was patiently waiting for them to walk through the hospital doors so I could put him on my chest,\u201d Mr. Goette recalled.Seeing the two of them together for the first time \u201cwas the most amazing thing I had ever seen,\u201d Ms. Goette said. \u201cThat made me very happy.\u201dMr. Goette had his surgery on Monday and the couple are now both back at home, surrounded by family, as they adjust to life as new parents.\u201cWe\u2019re really lucky,\u201d Ms. Goette said.Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
