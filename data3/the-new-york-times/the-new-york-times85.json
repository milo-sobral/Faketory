{"id": "Douglas Rain, 90, Shakespearean and Voice of Computer Named HAL, Dies", "paragraph": "Supported byBy Neil GenzlingerDouglas Rain, who performed for 32 seasons with the Stratford Festival in Ontario but was perhaps most famous for one faceless movie role \u2014 the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s landmark 1968 film, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d \u2014 died on Sunday in St. Marys, Ontario. He was 90.The Stratford Festival announced his death.\u201cDouglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick\u2019s iconic creation,\u201d Antoni Cimolino, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said. \u201cPrecision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor. But those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the center of his mystery lay warmth and humanity.\u201dMr. Rain was well known to audiences at the Stratford Festival, where he appeared in its inaugural production, \u201cRichard III,\u201d in 1953, playing the Marquess of Dorset and Tyrrell and serving as understudy to Alec Guinness in the title role.What turned out to be, in a sense, a career-making job came along in 1960, when Mr. Rain narrated a Canadian documentary about astronomy and space called \u201cUniverse.\u201d It caught Mr. Kubrick\u2019s attention; he is said to have watched it scores of times. And when he was having trouble finding a voice that he liked for HAL 9000 \u2014 the onboard computer on a spaceship carrying astronauts on a mysterious mission \u2014 he thought of the documentary\u2019s narration.\u201c2001\u201d had already been shot, and various concepts for the voice of HAL had been tried. At one point the computer was envisioned as female. The actor Martin Balsam recorded HAL\u2019s lines but was deemed not quite right. During filming, the British actor Nigel Davenport read the lines off-camera for a time for the benefit of Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, who played the astronauts, and then Mr. Kubrick had an assistant director, also British, do it.Mr. Kubrick, not satisfied with any of those, sought out Mr. Rain. They met at a recording studio outside London. Mr. Rain recorded his lines in a day and a half, with Mr. Kubrick, who died in 1999, explaining the scenes to him and giving him only the sparsest of directorial notes.Mr. Rain\u2019s rendition of the lines (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that\u201d) was dispassionate in a way that was both soothing and unsettling. His readings were cool to the point of being chilling, especially as the story moved along and HAL became malevolent.Gerry Flahive, a former documentary producer for the National Film Board of Canada who interviewed Mr. Rain in 2014, and who has written several articles about how the HAL voice has influenced the sound of artificial intelligence in the age of Siri, said Mr. Rain was not starry-eyed about his involvement with \u201c2001.\u201d\u201cRain loved to immerse himself in the development of the roles he played, so the quick recording session with Stanley Kubrick, which gave him no context for the character of HAL and no collaboration with other actors, along with the director\u2019s seemingly flip decision to cast him at almost the last minute, left him unimpressed with the whole experience,\u201d Mr. Flahive said by email.\u201cHe said to me in 2014, \u2018If you could have been a ghost at the recording you would have thought it was a load of rubbish.\u2019 Despite its notoriety and his famous connection to it, Rain never saw \u20182001: A Space Odyssey.\u2019 \u201dA memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Douglas James Rain was born on May 9, 1928, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His father, James, was a railroad switchman, and his mother, Mary Crichton McIntyre, was a nurse.He studied at the University of Manitoba, from which he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1950, and the Banff Center for the Arts. He also spent a year at the Old Vic School in London before returning to Canada to join the fledgling Stratford Festival.Within a few years he was playing major roles there, including Iago in \u201cOthello\u201d in 1959, the title role in \u201cKing John\u201d in 1960 and Edgar in \u201cKing Lear\u201d in 1964.Howard Taubman, reviewing \u201cHenry IV, Part 1\u201d at Stratford in 1965 for The New York Times, said that Mr. Rain, in the role of Henry, Prince of Wales, \u201cperforms with a youthful dash in the early scenes and then turns gallant in the later ones with equal fervor.\u201dMr. Rain appeared several times on Broadway. His performance in \u201cVivat! Vivat Regina!\u201d in 1972 earned him a Tony Award nomination as best featured actor in a play.He was also seen in numerous television shows and several other movies, including \u201c2010: The Year We Made Contact,\u201d a sequel to \u201c2001\u201d in which he reprised the role of HAL. His was also the voice of the computer in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cSleeper\u201d in 1973.Mr. Rain\u2019s marriages to Lois Shaw and Martha Henry ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons, David and Adam; a daughter, Emma Rain; and a granddaughter.In a 1981 interview with the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, Mr. Rain recalled \u201cUniverse,\u201d the documentary that led to his \u201c2001\u201d fame.\u201cIt was a very low-budget affair with Ping-Pong balls, and the sun, as I recall, was played by a tomato,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, it came off as very impressive on the screen.\u201dHis appeal to Mr. Kubrick was often attributed to the dialect his voice generally fell into, something called Standard Canadian English.A University of Toronto linguistics professor, Jack Chambers, once explained the appeal.\u201cYou have to have a computer that sounds like he\u2019s from nowhere, or, rather, from no specific place,\u201d he once said. \u201cStandard Canadian English sounds \u2018normal\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s why Canadians are well received in the United States as anchormen and reporters, because the vowels don\u2019t give away the region they come from.\u201dThe American Film Institute once listed the 50 greatest movie villains. HAL came in at No. 13.Advertisement"}
