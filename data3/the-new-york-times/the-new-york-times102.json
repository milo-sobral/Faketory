{"id": "Federer Falls Short of a 100th Title. But He Does Get an Apology.", "paragraph": "Supported byBy The Associated PressLONDON \u2014 After pulling off one of the biggest victories of his career, Alexander Zverev felt he had no choice but to apologize to the player he had just defeated, who happened to be none other than Roger Federer.Zverev denied Federer a shot at a 100th career title by beating him, 7-5, 7-6 (5), on Saturday to advance to the championship match at the ATP Finals. But that was not why Zverev felt the need to say he was sorry.Instead, his apology stemmed from a quirky moment in the second-set tiebreaker. Federer was leading the tiebreaker, 4-3, and seemed to have the edge on a Zverev service point when a ball boy at the back of the court dropped a ball. Zverev immediately signaled for the point to be stopped, and the umpire then ordered it to be replayed.Zverev proceeded to serve an ace before going on to close out the match moments later.\u201cI want to apologize for the situation in the tiebreak,\u201d Zverev said in his on-court interview after the match, which was punctuated with some boos from the crowd. \u201cThe ball boy dropped the ball, so it\u2019s in the rules that we have to replay the point.\u201cI\u2019m a little bit upset about the whole situation because this is not how I wanted it to end,\u2019\u2019 Zverev added.At one point, his on-court interviewer, Annabelle Croft, came to Zverev\u2019s defense, telling the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you are booing; he is telling the truth.\u2019\u2019At 21, Zverev is the youngest player to reach the championship match of the event since 2009 and the first from Germany to do so since 1996. He will next face Novak Djokovic, who defeated Kevin Anderson, 6-2, 6-2, in the other semifinal on Saturday.Federer, 37, was seeking a record-extending seventh title in this event, but he was unable to cope with the pressure created by Zverev\u2019s power and precision at the O2 Arena.\u201cHe apologized to me at the net,\u201d Federer said of Zverev after the match ended. \u201cI was like, \u2018Buddy, shut up. You don\u2019t need to apologize to me here. Congratulations on a great match and a great tournament so far. All the best for the finals.\u2019 And you move on.\u201dWhen Zverev signaled for play to stop during the tiebreaker, Federer appeared perplexed, and he approached the umpire, Carlos Bernardes, for an explanation. He said afterward that he never at any point felt Zverev was engaging in gamesmanship.As for the ball boy, Federer said he hoped he didn\u2019t have a sleepless night after his mishap. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal at the end of the day,\u2019\u2019 he said.An inspired series of shots had earned Zverev the first break points of the match in the 12th game of the first set, and Federer then sent a forehand wide to fall behind.Federer willed himself to a break for a 2-1 lead in the second set, but Zverev quickly composed himself to capture the following game.Zverev then followed up the unusual interruption caused by the ball boy to establish a 5-4 lead in the second-set tiebreaker, and Federer then netted the simplest of forehand volleys to summon match point.Federer won the next point, but Zverev then put away a backhand volley to win the match and leave Federer waiting until next season for his 100th title.\u201cOver all, I\u2019m happy how the season went,\u201d said Federer, who picked up his 20th Grand Slam title early in the year at the Australian Open. \u201cThere\u2019s many positives. So I\u2019m excited for next season.\u201dWhen, presumably, he will win his 100th title in somewhat orderly fashion, without any balls being dropped during play.Advertisement"}
