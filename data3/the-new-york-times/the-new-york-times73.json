The protest arrives as increasing attention is being paid to the extensive power that Amazon wields as a retailer \u2014 a power that is greatest in books.The stores are calling their action Banned Booksellers Week. The protest got its start after AbeBooks sent emails last month to booksellers in countries including South Korea, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia to say that it would no longer \u201csupport\u201d them. \u201cWe apologize for this inconvenience,\u201d the company said.As the news spread, even unaffected dealers were surprised and angered. AbeBooks, together with Amazon itself, is by far the biggest international marketplace for secondhand and rare books.AbeBooks lists millions of books and manages the payments. The booksellers mail the books directly from their shops. The platform was founded in 1995 and was bought by Amazon in 2008. It continues to operate independently, and many of its customers never even realize who the owner is. AbeBooks is based in Victoria, British Columbia, where it started.The Amazon subsidiary told the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers that it was scaling back because \u201cit is no longer viable for us to operate in these countries due to increasing costs and complexities.\u201dThe reaction was fierce. \u201cAbeBooks is saying, \u2018We\u2019re cutting you and your country off. It\u2019s nothing you did, we just decided we don\u2019t want to deal with you anymore,\u2019\u201d said Scott Brown, a bookseller in Eureka, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating.\u201dOne of the affected booksellers was Antikvariat Valentinska, a large antiquarian store in the center of Prague. \u201cThe decision to close our account on such short notice has come as a complete shock, especially since no reason was given, not even upon request,\u201d the store said in a statement. \u201cJust our company alone will almost certainly have to dismiss at least five employees.\u201dPeter Harrington, a leading London antiquarian dealer, said AbeBooks\u2019 \u201chigh-handed manner\u201d was at the root of the protest, with the platform taking the affected booksellers and \u201cdestroying their livelihoods in just a couple of impersonal sentences.\u201dLast week, the Antiquarian Booksellers\u2019 Association, based in London, responded by saying it would drop AbeBooks as a sponsor of its 2019 book fair. \u201cOur mission is to champion the highest standards of rare bookselling across the world, irrespective of location,\u201d the association said. \u201cSadly we feel that AbeBooks is not a suitable fair sponsor for us at this time.\u201dSimon Beattie, a British bookseller, set in motion the impromptu strike on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI have decided to put my books on (permanent) vacation on ABE in solidarity with fellow booksellers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea and Russia,\u201d he wrote to colleagues. \u201cI hope you might like to follow suit.\u201dIn the tight-knit, if loosely organized, antiquarian community, the idea quickly spread.On Saturday night, in response to a query from a reporter, AbeBooks issued a statement saying it was dropping the countries because \u201cour third-party payment service provider is closing at the end of the year.\u201d It added that, \u201cWe regret that we cannot continue to serve all sellers.\u201dAsked how many booksellers and countries were affected, Richard Davies, an AbeBooks spokesman, said, \u201cI am not adding anything else to that statement.\u201dMr. Brown, one of the dealers organizing the protests, said that for many of the booksellers, AbeBooks\u2019 actions underlined both Amazon\u2019s power and its refusal to be accountable for it.\u201cThe biggest e-commerce giant in the world apparently finds it too complicated to do business in Prague,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to wonder who\u2019s next. We\u2019re all vulnerable to Amazon\u2019s capricious actions.\u201dUnderlying the mystifying nature of the action, Amazon itself is still selling merchandise from the banned countries, including books.Since Abebooks controls its storefront, the only recourse the protesting booksellers have is to tell it that they are \u201con vacation.\u201d The marketplace then puts a message next to their name saying, \u201cThis member\u2019s inventory is temporarily offline. Please check back later.\u201d There was no acknowledgment that this was not business as usual.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the British bookseller who set in motion a strike against AbeBooks. He is Simon Beattie, not Beattle.Advertisement"}
