{"id": "Down With the Year of the Woman", "paragraph": "Supported bynews analysisWe need to normalize female politicians, not act as though they\u2019re unicorns. And if someone says \u201cpink wave\u201d again, I\u2019m going to dry heave.By Amy ChozickMs. Chozick is a writer at large for The Times covering business, politics and media.I know that when I hear 2018 called the Year of the Woman, I am supposed to huddle with my girlfriends, preferably over ros\u00e9, and celebrate the historic number of female candidates in the midterm elections. And yet, I have to confess that the term bums me out.Really? I think whenever I hear it. We only get a year?The way we talk about all of these female candidates as they try to drag that cave man known as Congress a bit closer to gender parity leaves me discouraged about how little progress we\u2019ve made. After all, it was Senator Barbara Mikulski who, after she was re-elected in the first Year of the Woman in 1992, said that the term \u201cmakes it sound like the Year of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus.\u201dAre female candidates still unicorns, magical woodland creatures that rear their sparkly horns every couple of decades, and only when provoked, as they were after Anita Hill\u2019s testimony in 1991 and Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s agonizing account of sexual assault last month?Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have signaled they may run for president in 2020, which would make that election the most female ever (The Year of the Woman on Steroids, to borrow The Washington Post\u2019s phrase). So it\u2019s all the more urgent that we find a less archaic way of talking about women in politics, preferably one that doesn\u2019t make them seem like a stop in the Chinese zodiac.I was curious about whether other women felt the same way I did \u2014 encouraged by the uptick in female candidates yet exasperated that the phenomenon is still characterized as some chromosomal anomaly that couldn\u2019t have happened without a man. If President Trump hadn\u2019t bragged about sexual assault and called a gorgeous porn star a horseface, would we still be getting our year?I started to ask around, a bit sheepishly. It turned out I wasn\u2019t a traitor to my gender after all. Almost every woman I talked to also chafed at the Year of the Woman framework. \u201cIt makes us seem like the outliers, we\u2019re still not the norm,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.The phrase \u201cpink wave\u201d is even worse. CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan spoke for women everywhere (or at least for me) when she cut off a Democratic strategist with: \u201cCan we not call it a pink wave? Like, c\u2019mon.\u201dPink is tender and sweet \u2026 exactly the opposite of the red-hot rage fueling many women this election cycle.Nita Chaudhary, a co-founder of UltraViolet, a women\u2019s advocacy group, said this election is about \u201canger, women being so fed up\u201d with Mr. Trump and his agenda. She said about the candidates, \u201cA lot of them didn\u2019t want to put themselves in this position and expose their families and their entire lives, but damn it, if women won\u2019t save us, no one else will.\u201dThe fact that we\u2019re wrestling with what to call this female-infused election year speaks to the underrepresentation of women not just in politics but also in media, said Jessica Knoll, a Los Angeles-based novelist and screenwriter. There was a reason it was Ms. Bolduan who put a stop to the \u201cpink wave\u201d talk.\u201cIt minimizes it, it cutesies it up, and you needed a woman to say, \u2018Don\u2019t call it that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Knoll said. \u201cOn a macro level, that\u2019s why we need more women at the table everywhere.\u201dWhen I covered Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, I\u2019d often study how Maureen Dowd expertly wrote about Geraldine Ferraro after she ran as the first female vice-presidential nominee of a major party in 1984. Back then, the nation grappled with some pretty basic questions of decorum: What should she do with her purse? (\u201cYou caught yourself thinking incongruously: A vice president with a purse?\u201d Dowd wrote.) Should she be referred to as a \u201crunning person,\u201d that way avoiding the romantic overtones of \u201crunning mate\u201d? Then there was the memorable advice from a Democratic pollster: \u201cMondale cannot, whatever he does, kiss her.\u201dWe\u2019ve settled on \u201crunning mate\u201d (thank you, Sarah Palin), but 34 years and a woman at the top of the presidential ticket later, so many questions remain.How does Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat candidate for Congress in New Jersey, balance raising young children with campaigning? Could Zephyr Teachout handle the rigors of running for the Democratic nominee for attorney general of New York while pregnant? How will the divorce of Susan Wild, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania, play?\u201cThey\u2019re often treated like they\u2019re exceptional, miraculous,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has advised female candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s great to celebrate and energize people around women running, but we need to normalize, not exceptionalize it.\u201dStudies show that voters want to know their elected officials (especially if they\u2019re women) in more personal terms. I, for one, devour any story about a candidate\u2019s diet or workout routine and might even have bought Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tricycle-red lipstick ($22 at Sephora, if you\u2019re wondering).But there is also a fear that for every story about juggling politics with play dates, we aren\u2019t hearing about the candidate\u2019s agenda.\u201cIt obviates some of the larger policy questions these candidates want to talk about and recenters their candidacies around identity and more specifically gender,\u201d said Anne Helen Petersen, the author of \u201cToo Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud: The Rise and Reign of the Unruly Woman.\u201dIn other words, when a man runs for office, why is he just a candidate, but when a woman runs, she is a female candidate?Even campaigns that don\u2019t plan to emphasize the candidate\u2019s gender find themselves defined by it. Cynthia Nixon, who recently lost her Democratic primary contest to Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, ended up in a fight about how cool the temperature should be in the debate hall at Hofstra University on Long Island. The Nixon campaign accused Mr. Cuomo, who prefers Arctic conditions, of being \u201cnotoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature.\u201d Ms. Nixon, who like many women shivers at the sight of an office air-conditioner, fought for a balmy 76 degrees.We might as well have been talking about where Ms. Ferraro should plop down her purse. That\u2019s when I realized that as much as I recoil at the Year of the Woman (and dry heave at the \u201cpink wave\u201d), the bigger problem with treating female candidates like novelties is that, sadly, they are.The Democratic Party gave itself a 25-year-long pat on the back when it ushered in the original Year of the Woman in 1992, an election that nearly doubled the number of women in Congress to \u2026 10 percent. This year, women, roughly 51 percent of the nation\u2019s population, make up 29 percent of Democratic and Republican candidates for the House and 32 percent of Democratic and Republican candidates for the Senate, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers.That\u2019s progress, but not exactly a tsunami, or even a wave. It\u2019s more like \u201ca pleasant ripple that gets us closer to 50 percent,\u201d Ms. Knoll said.As Jennifer L. Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia who has written extensively about women in politics, put it, \u201cIt will be the \u2018Year of the Woman\u2019 when we\u2019re not talking about it.\u201dAmy Chozick, a writer at large for The Times covering business, politics and media, is the author of the memoir \u201cChasing Hillary.\u201dFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion).
