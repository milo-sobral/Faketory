On tonight\u2019s installment, we learned via Ryan\u2019s parents Jen and Larry exactly what Benny was told of his father\u2019s whereabouts and his recent legal woes and the how grandparents decided together that honesty was the best policy.When producer Kiki asked the Edwards to discuss Ryan\u2019s recent arrest (he violated his parole by not doing his court-ordered community service), Jen expressed disappointment in her son.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t mad that he was [in jail]. I was like, 'You deserve it,'\u201d she said. Larry had more to say, like how the two worry about how Ryan\u2019s actions will affect his pregnant wife Mackenzie, along with Bentley.\u201cWe worry about Mack. She just doesn\u2019t need this right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worry about Ryan, but we worry about Bentley too.\u201dFrom there, Larry revealed what they told their nine-year-old grandson (off-camera) about his father.\u201cHe asked me out there in the garage where Dad was. I knew he knew, but I knew he needed to hear it from us,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him the truth, and I told him, \u2018The most important thing is your daddy is still clean.\u2019 And he started crying. I said, \u2018Buddy, he\u2019s going to be okay.' He\u2019s got us and we\u2019re going to be fine.\"But despite his brave front with Bentley, Larry told Kiki he still has concerns.\u201c[Ryan's] still a grown man,\" he said. \"He still makes his own decisions. With addiction, you just never know if today\u2019s the day.\u201dHow do you think Jen and Larry handled sharing the news with their grandson?
