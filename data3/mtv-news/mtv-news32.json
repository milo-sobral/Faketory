{"id": "\n\n                Is Stephan And Kayla\u2019s Co-Parenting Relationship Doomed On Young And Pregnant?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              A judge told the young dad to start paying up -- and he wasn't happy about it\n        \n          Considering Kayla and Stephan are no longer a couple on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant, they\u2019re doing pretty well in keeping things civil for the sake of their son Izaiah. But a new court-ordered arrangement, in which the state required Stephan to pay child support, could take these two a few steps backward in their co-parenting relationship.On tonight\u2019s episode, Kayla told her friend and mom she felt \u201cawkward\u2019 and \u201cnervous\u201d to be going to court with her ex, especially because it was the state of Illinois (and not her) that mandated the hearing.And after three hours in court, things got more awkward \u2014 the judge ruled that Stephan must get a job and pay $128 a month toward his son\u2019s expenses.\u201cThat\u2019s like a pack of diapers,\u201d Kayla told her best friend Annabelle. She added that \u201cStephan was cranky because...they ordered him to find a job. If he doesn\u2019t, he could be in contempt of court... I know he\u2019s pissed right now, but I feel like it\u2019s good for him.\u201dAnd Kayla was right. Stephan was angry with what went down but also felt as though Kayla had more to do with the child support request than she said.\u201cI\u2019m skeptical of Kayla,\" he told a pal. \"I feel like she knows more than what she be portraying...[but] my goal is to make sure that Izaiah is going to grow up right.\u201dDo you think Kayla was secretly behind the court order? And will her new arrangement with Stephan mess up their co-parenting situation or help them move forward and be equal parenting partners for Izaiah?
