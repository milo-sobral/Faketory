{"id": "\n\n Young And Pregnant Sabotage: Is Amber Trying To Stop Lexi From Leaving Home?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              Kyler's mom thinks it's a definite possibility\n        \n          Lexi has made it very clear on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant that she is not yet ready to move with Kyler and their son to Arizona. Her mom, Amber, certainly doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s time for the young family to be on their own either, and a new move on her part could be her way of keeping her daughter and grandson around for just a little bit longer.After Lexi\u2019s car \u201ccrapped out\u201d on this week's episode, Amber co-signed her daughter\u2019s lease on a new vehicle \u2014 she got a $30K loan \u2014 that is more reliable and safer for Tobias. In return, Lexi decided to find a part-time job to pay for the car payments. But Kyler saw Amber\u2019s financial assistance as a way to keep Lexi in Colorado.\u201cSo I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t want to move as quick now that you have to pay off your car?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou knew that [we were moving right away] -- you just wanted to be with your mom longer.\u201dKyler\u2019s mom Kati, meanwhile, agreed that the new car situation will impede on their family\u2019s plans.\u201cDo you think that the reason why she\u2019s helping with her new car is another way to make sure, financially, that she stays in the home?\u201d Kati asked her son. \u201cOr do you think it\u2019s a trust thing that she doesn\u2019t think that you can financially support Lexi the way that she is used to living?\u201dKyler's reply? He told his mother they\u2019re moving whether Lexi (or Amber) like it or not. But who\u2019s going to win this battle? And is Amber's help with the car a manipulative move to keep her daughter and grandson around, or is she just trying to lend a hand?
