That's the spirit of \"8th Grade,\" track eight on\u00a0Caution, which Mariah says stems from the fact that the song's message reminds her of the poetry-writing girl she was in middle school.Mariah and Sway took a moment to look back at the singer's close friendship with Ol' Dirty Bastard and what it was like to lose him fourteen years ago this month. That's an experience, Mariah says, that she'll need to write about in the book she revealed she's working on now.Looking\u00a0back over more of her\u00a0legendary career, Mariah was beaming as she explained the drama over her VMA gag with Whitney Houston in 1998. Planning to appear together on stage in the same dress, Mariah recalled\u00a0the circumstances that led to a police escort that night -- for the dress.Before the morning was over, the\u00a0TRL\u00a0studio audience was left gasping after two Mariah superfans got engaged, complete with a speech about how Mariah's music brought them together. Watch the heartwarming surprise from the\u00a0TRL\u00a0stage below -- and don't forget to listen to Mariah's new album,\u00a0Caution, out now.\u00a0TRL\u00a0airs on weekdays at 8:00am ET.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
