{"id": "\n\n                Halsey's Raw 'Without Me' EMA Performance Ended With A Downpour\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              The song's stage debut was a powerful one\n        \n          Before she began singing \"Without Me\" literally on her hands and knees onstage at the 2018 MTV EMA, Halsey revealed that this was her first time singing it live. Not just on television, mind you \u2014 first time ever. Knowing that makes everything she did up there even more impressive.Halsey sang the song, sure, but she did it while chained to a post, enclosed in a glass case (of emotion), and, eventually, drenched in a downpour. It mirrored the video's depressive intensity, visually capturing the rawness of a song Halsey said she \"cried the whole time\" while recording.Though she spent most of the harrowing song trapped in a box, the performance took a very watery turn when the case lifted \u2014 as soon as the \"Cry Me a River\" interpolation hit \u2014 and Halsey got soaked by the rain. After the final notes rang out, she sat there on the ground for a moment, collecting herself.\"It's just me. No wig, no colorful hair, no character,\" she said of the song when it premiered in October, \"and it's about my life and about my relationship that the world has watched so closely and so vehemently in the past year and a half.\" The video has its own G-Eazy lookalike, but on the EMA stage, it was just Halsey. And she was more than enough.See the full list of EMA winners here, and catch the entire show at 7 p.m. ET on MTV or stream on MTVEMA.com!\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
