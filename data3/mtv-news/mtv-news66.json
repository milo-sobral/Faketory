{"id": "\n\n                I Can't Believe EXO Is Finally Back And Kai Is Wearing A Crop Top\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              The K-pop stars switch up the 'Tempo' with their eclectic new single\n        \n          It's been a minute, but South Korean favorites EXO are finally back with their fifth studio album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo. And they're kicking off this new era with \"Tempo,\" a catchy melodic anomaly that, true to its name, seamlessly switches up the tempo from smooth R&B, to retro pop, to hip-hop, to acapella \u2014 all in under 4 minutes. If the rhythmic hook doesn't immediately grab your attention (\"don't mess up my tempo,\" they plea), then the unique vocal bridge \u2014 acapella kings! \u2014 should do the trick, featuring EXO's stacked vocal line and their dynamic harmonies. Or, perhaps main dancer Kai looking fierce in a crop top is more your speed. There's something for everyone! Speaking of the video, it's a real trip. Starring all nine members \u2014 \"Tempo\" marks Lay Zhang's long-awaited return to the group \u2014 the stylistic visual is both modern and nostalgic, putting a cool twist on label SM Entertainment's typical \"box\" format. The motorcycle-gang aesthetic from the teaser images was a bit of a red herring; instead, the slick video features the group moving through various sets \u2014 a bar, a bedroom (the creaking bed sample does not go unnoticed on the hook), an interrogation room, and, of course, a dance floor \u2014 with a mature color palette that may be more muted than \"Ko Ko Bop\" but packs just as much personality. While Lay doesn't have much to do in this video \u2014 he's primarily a cameo \u2014 he is heavily featured on the Chinese version of the single, which also dropped today (November 2). The album features 10 new tracks, including the Latin-pop \"Ooh La La La,\" which was co-written by American hitmaker Bazzi (who also worked on \"The Eve\" off the group's last album), and the smooth \"Bad Dream,\" an R&B track with a disco hook. Just like its lead single, Don't Mess Up My Tempo defies all genres \u2014 a distinct marker of an EXO production. \u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
