Even after The CW passed on Sabrina and it landed on Netflix, he\u2019s still holding out hope for some kind of meeting between the neighboring towns and their curious teens. \u201cI would hate if there was no way possible for there ever to be a crossover,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly ahead of Sabrina\u2019s premiere.But what would happen if these two groups met? It seems safe to say that Sabrina Spellman would get along with the Core Four \u2014 Archie Andrews, Veronica Lodge, Betty Cooper, and Jughead Jones \u2014 because all five characters are generally agreeable and welcoming. But what about Sabrina\u2019s potential relationship with Riverdale\u2019s fieriest resident, Cheryl Blossom?Let\u2019s examine, starting with a look at the two teens\u2019 demeanors.Meet Sabrina, Meet CherylSabrina is a cheery 16-year-old firmly and comfortably on the outskirts of the typical high school social food chain. She\u2019s not a popular kid, not a brainiac nor theater kid nor loner. She\u2019s simply Sabrina.Her ability to sympathize is incredibly strong, making her kind and loving. That is, until someone crosses her. In that case, Sabrina is completely unafraid to stand up to her nemeses and is keen to use magic to do so. (A prime example of this behavior was when she doused Principal Hawthorne in spiders because he wouldn\u2019t take action against the jocks who were terrorizing her mortal best friend, Susie.)Meanwhile, on the other side of Sweetwater River, Cheryl is sitting pretty as a Queen Bee of Riverdale High. Everyone knows her, and everyone knows to stay out of her way. It may take some finesse to get on her good side, but once you\u2019re there, she will shoot her bow and arrow with Robin Hood-level accuracy to protect you from your enemies.The two share a to-the-death commitment to their friends, which is a promising sign for their own friendship \u2014 as long as Sabrina and Cheryl can reach that level of companionship. But friendship is a two-way street, so there are two questions we need to answer before coming to any kind of conclusion: Would Sabrina Like Cheryl?Sabrina would definitely admire that Cheryl is strong-willed and can take care of herself \u2014 qualities she values \u2014 but she might have a difficult time looking past Cheryl's tough exterior to actually like her upon first meeting.Over time, however, as Sabrina learns more about Cheryl\u2019s past with her family and the forced suppression of her sexuality, her sympathetic nature would likely take the wheel. Sabrina loves an underdog overcoming the odds, after all. (See: her entire friend group, Susie, Ros, and Harvey, all of whom come to grips with their destiny during the course of the season.)On Sabrina's end, her potential for friendship with Cheryl could be comparable to her relationship with fellow witch Prudence, another strong-willed female. Things between Sabrina and Prudence started out tense, to put it mildly. Their journey was something like this: They both tried to kill each other, Sabrina figured out details of Prudence's past and saved her from cannibalization, Prudence helped Sabrina bring back the dead, and Sabrina joined Prudence's clique.There were some vicious ups and downs, but in the end, Sabrina proudly walked alongside her one-time bully, so it goes to reason that with patience and understanding, the teenage witch would like the River Vixen \u2014 particularly after Sabrina decides to embrace her own dark side and can fully empathize with Cheryl\u2019s taste for darkness.Would Cheryl Like Sabrina?Whether Cheryl would like Sabrina is a little trickier because, well, does Cheryl truly like anyone not named Toni Topaz? There is one immediate pro for Sabrina: Cheryl would approve of the red in Sabrina\u2019s wardrobe. Sharing a signature color shows that they have similar preferences and ensures that their outfits would never clash, and Cheryl does love a look. At the very least, it doesn't hurt.Superficial aspects aside, Cheryl might be put off by Sabrina\u2019s tendencies to always do the \u201cgood\u201d thing, since Cheryl is typically more interested in the good-for-Cheryl thing \u2014 like boosting her academic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by snagging Archie\u2019s student council presidency while he\u2019s in juvenile detention rather than letting Veronica keep his seat warm. Cheryl\u2019s initially contentious relationship with good-girl-next-door Betty Cooper comes to mind as a comparison.But once she learns of Sabrina\u2019s penchant for revenge and witchy powers, Cheryl would be on board \u2014 if only because Cheryl seems to have witchy powers of her own. (Let\u2019s not forget the Kiss of Life she bestowed upon Fred Andrews after he became the Black Hood\u2019s first target!) For Cheryl, having Sabrina's powers on her side could be, at the very least, an opportunity to boost her own \u2014 and like Sabrina, Cheryl craves power.So, Would Sabrina And Cheryl Be Friends?There may be some hesitation on both sides at first, but once they get to know each other a bit, Sabrina and Cheryl could have dynamic duo potential, amplified by their (probably) shared powers. One thing is for sure: If that crossover between Riverdale and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina does end up happening, let\u2019s hope it's not at the stroke of midnight \u2014 the witching hour.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
