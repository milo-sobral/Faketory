{"id": "\n\n                Can Brianna And Her Young And Pregnant Family Survive In Oregon?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              Their new life on the West Coast isn\u2019t going as planned -- to say the least\n        \n          When Brianna decided on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant to move from Wisconsin to Oregon with her son and her boyfriend, it seemed like a good idea. The group (including Brianna's mother Jessica) would start over in a new city and have lots of help with Baby Braeson. But Brianna quickly realized that their new life wasn\u2019t what she expected.On this week\u2019s episode, the family settled into their destination after a very long road trip (and a sad goodbye to Bri\u2019s sister Vanessa). However, they arrived with nowhere to live \u2014 they were staying at an Airbnb indefinitely \u2014 no jobs lined up, and no real solid plan of what would happen next.To add to the situation, Robert still needed to finish high school and Brianna wanted to start college, but the couple couldn\u2019t even consider schooling until they got jobs and an apartment.After an unsuccessful employment search, Brianna and Robert talked with Jessica, who said \u201cnot finding jobs is not an option\u201d and they all must do everything they can to get back on their feet. If it took longer than anticipated, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to just sell the car just so we can buy food.\u201dBrianna was frazzled by the whole situation, both for her sake and for Braeson\u2019s.\u201cThis sh*t sucks,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we should\u2019ve stayed in Milwaukee. Initially, when we said yes, I  thought we\u2019d be coming here to an apartment. But now that we\u2019re here, we\u2019re in an Airbnb, no jobs. It\u2019s a lot of stress.\u201dUnfortunately, moving back to Milwaukee isn\u2019t an option because the family spent all their money getting to Oregon, so what\u2019s next for them? Will they make it work on the West Coast and, if not, where will they live? Tell us your predictions, then keep watching Young and Pregnant Mondays at 10/9c.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
