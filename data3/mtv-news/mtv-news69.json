It\u2019s reminiscent of The Fault In Our Stars, but with much higher stakes. In this case, it's not just their illness that leaves them at risk; their actual relationship could be deadly.Richardson stars as Stella, the cheery-against-all-odds girl who can laugh about death with her nurse, yet takes her treatment very seriously. Sprouse is broody Will, the type who \u201cignores the rules because it makes you feel in control.\u201d They immediately connect on an emotional level, but there\u2019s a catch: They can\u2019t come within six feet of one another without risking infecting the other. Rule-following Stella, keeping a slight distance, promptly takes on the role of regimenting Will\u2019s treatment to keep him alive, and in the process, realizes that she hasn\u2019t really been living herself. The trailer shows flashes of Stella at two extremes \u2014 happily enjoying life outside of the hospital in one moment and an intense health scare in the next. At one point Stella, aching for human touch, resolves to steal back one foot from the disease that has stolen to much from her and dares to come within five feet of Will, hence the film\u2019s name.Jane the Virgin\u2019s Justin Baldoni makes his directorial debut with the film, set to hit theaters in March 2019.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
