Megan's IRL-to-pumpkin comparison photos often rack up thousands of likes on her Twitter and Instagram pages.In 2017, Megan's intricate carvings of Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift caught the eyes of fans across the internet. It was Taylor Swift, in fact, who was at the core of how this all started a year earlier.\"The pumpkin carving actually started out as a bet with my sister in 2016,\" Megan told TRL\u00a0over Twitter direct messages. \"She told me if I could carve the cover of 1989 on a pumpkin almost perfectly she would fly with me to Austin, Texas to see Taylor Swift\u2019s Formula 1 concert.\"Taking the bet seriously, Megan carved a perfect set of Taylor pumpkins and discovered a new, spooky talent. And yes, she got to go to that concert in Texas.There weren't many tutorials for the detailed, shading-based type of pumpkin carving that Megan has perfected, but with a lifelong passion for art and design, the technique came naturally.\"It\u2019s all about carving different depths to create shading,\" Megan told TRL\u00a0about her method.\u00a0\"The more you carve out the lighter the pumpkin is, and vice versa. I mostly use an x-acto knife to do that but I also use clay modeling tools and a pumpkin drill.\"Last year's carving of Shawn Mendes went particularly viral with more than 11,000 likes on Twitter. Not only has Megan mastered Shawn in pumpkin form, but as a fan she's met him a few times, too.\"Not only do I love his music, but also his character,\" Megan said. \"He\u2019s so genuine and real with his fans. He treats us almost like his friends.\"This year, Megan\u00a0has already begun her pumpkins for Halloween, including a carving of Why Don't We's album art for\u00a08 Letters\u00a0that's caught the attention of the boy band itself. Daniel responded \"no way\" to the pumpkin, Jonah followed her and the main band account retweeted the photos.\"I loved every song on the album,\" Megan said of her newfound love for Why Don't We. \"It\u2019s inspiring to see such young artists do what they do and be so successful.\"With Halloween quickly approaching, Megan has more pumpkin plans for 2018. \"I\u2019m planning on carving the cover of Shawn\u2019s new album,\" Megan said, \"and another Taylor Swift one of her AMA performance. But I\u2018m also going to be carving some for a few local businesses, too.\"Watch out for Megan's pumpkin carving talent to continue to blow minds on her Twitter and Instagram, right in time for the peak of spooky season!\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
