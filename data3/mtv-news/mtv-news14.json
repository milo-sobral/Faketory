So will the pink trend continue with the couple's \"rainbow baby\" -- or will blue be making an entrance?The blue will have to wait because Cate and Ty are having another princess! \u201cI was so shocked that it was a girl because I for sure thought it was a boy!\u201d Cate revealed to Us Weekly. \u201cTyler knew the sex before I did. When we did our gender reveal, I was so shocked I almost cried because I wanted a boy so badly. I\u2019m super excited it\u2019s a girl now. Since our miscarriage, I just am thankful to get another chance, and as long as it\u2019s healthy, that\u2019s all that matters!\u201dAnd will they eventually try for a boy?\u201cWe definitely want to have a boy, but if God only wants us to have girls, then that\u2019s just what it is,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cIt will be a houseful of all girls! Poor Tyler!\u201dNova expressed her desire for a baby sister -- and now this is a reality!
