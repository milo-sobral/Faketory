{"id": "\n\n Challenge Comebacks: Where Should Natalie And Paulie Cast Their Allegiance?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              After a rough road, the 'Big Brother' exports are suddenly in control of the game\n        \n          From zero to hero seems like a less triumphant tale than Natalie and Paulie\u2019s return to the Final Reckoning house. So now that they\u2019re back (and mission-winners!), the question remains: to whom should they cast their allegiance?On tonight\u2019s Challenge episode, and in tandem with fellow Armageddon winners Cara Maria and Marie, the Big Brother duo returned to the game after being eliminated in the third episode and failing twice in Episodes 4 and 10 to return. But with a huge victory over Brad and Kyle in Armageddon, they were both hungry for some serious redemption.And they got it. In \u201cHit List,\u201d Season 32\u2019s trivia-game installment, teams were tasked with answering a series of game-related questions while avoiding the accumulation of three strikes. They\u2019d earn a strike for either answering a question incorrectly, or after receiving a vote from a team that had answered a question correctly.To raise the stakes, three strikes also meant a giant battering ram would batter the losers into the waters far below.Five giant splashes later \u2014 and though they only boasted one previous Challenge showing among them \u2014 Natalie and Paulie were named the day\u2019s winners, and took a moment to bask in their glory.\u201cWe went from the Redemption House Heroes to the Elimination Round King and Queen to getting back in that house and winning the first challenge back,\u201d Paulie said. \u201cFeels good.\u201dAnd it seemed to feel even better for Johnny Bananas, whose fractured friendship with Natalie had been restored. Bananas seemed sure Paulie and Natalie would join his alliance and effectively even the game\u2019s score: The Outliers would have three teams (Johnny/Tony, Cara Maria/Marie, Natalie/Paulie), and the Lavender Ladies (Sylvia/Joss, Ashley/Hunter, Shane/Nelson) would have three teams, too.Still, Ashley wasn\u2019t so sure that Paulie and Natalie would so readily join Johnny\u2019s side, and said they remained total enigmas.\u201cI have no idea who Paulie and Natalie are gonna put their Power Vote on, because I\u2019m not really sure where their alliances lay,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI\u2019m confused about this team, and I don\u2019t trust them.\u201dSo, is Ashley right to have reservations? Or is there a chance Paulie and Natalie could spare her and Hunter from Armageddon?What do you think: Will Paulie and Natalie join on to the band of Final Reckoning defectors, or would it make their games easier to latch on to the Lavender Ladies?
