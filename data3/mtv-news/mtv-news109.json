Cut to Amber returning to Aldovia and moving into her own bridal suite. \"Suite? Wow!\" But it's not so sweet. Things quickly turn upside-down for Amber as extravagant wedding planning procedures become her main focus, and dodging paparazzi becomes a close second. She also needs to undergo a major image upheaval, including getting rid of her blog (They would never! Oh, wait...), causing some major tension between Amber and her future in-laws.It's up to young Emily (Honor Kneafsey) to explain to her older brother that this transition can be a lot for someone not used to this level of spotlight. But will they live happily ever after?Mine the trailer above for clues, and find out for sure when A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding drops on Netflix November 30.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
