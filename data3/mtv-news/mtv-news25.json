{"id": "\n\n                Will Teen Mom OG's Cory Try To Make A Move On The Newly Single Cheyenne?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              When he heard that Zach is history, Ryder's dad made an interesting comment...\n        \n          Well, we guess Cheyenne and Zach didn\u2019t improve their communication after their BBQ blow-up argument after all \u2014 on this week\u2019s Teen Mom OG, Cheyenne ended her relationship with her boyfriend-turned-roommate after another fight. So what went down \u2014 and more importantly, could this change things on the romantic front for Chey and Cory?Chey told her friends that she and Zach got into a big disagreement. The reason: Zach felt like she purposely told him to go to a family function he'd planned to attend and not accompany her to the street fair she planned to attend -- one that she'd be going to with Cory. As she told it, Zac then came home drunk and yelled at her, seemingly bitter that he wasn't her escort for the day.  \u201cHe says, \u2018You look like you about to go get f*cked,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe kept going, said I\u2019m weird, called me a bitch. And then I lost it. I packed his sh*t. I don\u2019t know how we come back from this. At this point, we are broken up. He\u2019s out.\u201dShe also expressed her worries to pals about ever finding a man due to her \u201cbaggage.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to bring a person into. Who\u2019s gonna wanna deal with me plus a baby -- plus I\u2019m best friends with my baby daddy?\u201d she cried. \u201cMy baggage is way too much. I seriously feel like I\u2019m just gonna be a single mom forever.\u201dWell, maybe not if Cory has something to do with it. When Chey later broke the news to Ryder\u2019s dad that she kicked out her beau, he originally thought that they were just giving each other space. But when Chey said point blank that they\u2019re over, Cory had an interesting reaction.\u201cWhen can I move in?\u201d he joked. \u201cGet out,\u201d Chey laughed in response.But do you think Cory was really joking, and will he really try to get with Cheyenne now that she's single? Even more important, should the two keep things platonic like they've always been or give romance a shot?
