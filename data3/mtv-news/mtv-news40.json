The photo shoot comes with an amazing alias, \"Phoni Braxton,\" and finds Bey styled with the pixie cut and leather jacket found on the cover of Braxton's 1993 self-titled debut album, as well as the album's lead single, \"Another Sad Love Song.\"A post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Oct 30, 2018 at 12:52pm PDTA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Oct 30, 2018 at 12:53pm PDTBeyonc\u00e9 proclaimed her love for Braxton in a written tribute, captioning one of the posts, \"Sending love and adoration to one of our talented legends.

No word yet on what Jay, Blue Ivy, Sir, or Rumi's costumes will be this year (maybe Jay will go as Braxton's fianc\u00e9, Birdman?!), but as always, Beyonc\u00e9's set the bar way, way high.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
