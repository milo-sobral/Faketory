This week's question:\u00a0which song is your automatic choice for karaoke?At my last birthday party, my friends and I sang\u00a0the one and only \u201cBreaking Free\u201d from High School Musical. Anything from HSM is a go for me because the songs are easy to sing and everyone around my age is somewhat nostalgic for them. Other good ones are \u201cWe\u2019re All in This Together\u201d, \u201cGet\u2019cha Head in The Game\u201d and \u201cBop To The Top\u201d. Plus, the fact that most people know the words without even looking at the screen makes it even more fun! \u2013Landyn PanWhile many people get uncomfortable doing karaoke, it\u2019s a place that feels very much like home for me. My friends and I have turned to karaoke to fill the void we have of missing singing and performing on a regular basis. I\u2019m a huge fan of contemporary, belty ballads and I have two go-to songs: \u201cNobody\u2019s Supposed To Be Here\u201d by the remix queen Deborah Cox and the show-stopping number \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\u201d from Dreamgirls. I always wonder if a ballad will bring down the mood, but they haven\u2019t failed me yet! \u2013Kristen Maldonado\u201cWagon Wheel\u201d by Old Crow Medicine Show is my karaoke go-to. As a mediocre singer, I like a crowd pleaser that encourages other people to sing along and this fits the bill. There\u2019s not a lot of note variation in this song and you can kind of talk-sing it -- both major pluses for me, not to mention I just love the song, generally. Most important of all, I already know all the words. \u00a0Pull this out at your next karaoke night, and I guarantee every midwesterner in the joint will scream with joy. \u2013Leah WilliamsGive me a microphone, a partner and the instrumental to \u201cIf I Die Young\u201d by The Band Perry and you\u2019re in for a full-blown performance by yours truly. Unlike most who just want to have fun, I probably take karaoke a little too seriously. It\u2019s my chance to pretend I\u2019m on my world tour, captivating an audience of 60,000, and \u201cIf I Die Young\u201d lets me give it my all and show off my vocal prowess (or lack thereof). Plus, the harmonies make it prime duet material, but rehearsals are encouraged to get it perfect. \u2014Matt GehringThis isn\u2019t what you would call a crowd-pleaser, but \u201cYoung Americans\u201d is nevertheless an anthem for our disillusioned decade, telling the sad story of two people pining for more than what their broken hearts and dashed dreams can give. They\u2019re desperate, angry and confused, feeling betrayed by a country that had promised them a brighter future as Watergate, unpaid bills, and the ghosts of America\u2019s past all loom large. Still, David Bowie resolves to tear through the confusion; he helps these people frantically search for their souls. Is there a more appropriate song to be belting aloud in 2018? \u2013Gus Turner\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
