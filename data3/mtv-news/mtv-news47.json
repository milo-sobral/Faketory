But could a change of scenery be just what this family needs to start over?On tonight\u2019s episode, Ashley learned her mom Tea was considering relocating from California to Atlanta. When Ashley asked Bar if he\u2019d be interested in potentially moving with her, he seemed resistant.\u201cThis is my playing field. This is what I know; this is where I\u2019m stationed,\u201d he said of the Bay Area. \u201cI think I\u2019m scared of moving that far away from home.\u201dBut once they got down to Atlanta, Bar quickly changed his mind, realizing how inexpensive and calm the lifestyle was there compared to the craziness of California and what a good life they could give Holly.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m pretty much damn near sold,\u201d he told his lady after looking at the house Tea wanted to purchase.During the same conversation, the engaged couple agreed to wait at least a few months before making the jump.\u201cI want to finish school, which automatically gives us four and a half months,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have whatever else time we need. I think right now, we should probably start [saving money].\u201dDo you think Ashley and Bar will they make the move or end up staying in California? And if they do relocate, will the Peach State give them the fresh start they need? Vote below, and keep watching Young and Pregnant Mondays at 10/9c.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
