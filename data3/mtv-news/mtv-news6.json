{"id": "\n\n                Maisie Williams Just Dished On Her Final Game Of Thrones Scene\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              Arya Stark's ending is 'beautiful,' she says\n        \n          Since filming her final scenes in July, Maisie Williams has officially moved on from Game of Thrones \u2014 look no further than her manicured hands for evidence of that. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fingernails painted for three weeks,\u201d she told The Guardian in a new interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how far out of the show I am. It really feels like a long time ago.\u201dShe admits the HBO hit is \"still very much a part of my life,\" thanks to her strong bonds with her former co-stars. But after portraying Arya (officially pronounced Arr-ya, not Arr-ee-ya, as the actress said she prefers) Stark for a total of eight seasons, she was ready for the story to be over.\u201cI got to the end and I didn\u2019t want more. I had exhausted every possible piece of Arya. And this season was quite big for me. I had a lot more to do,\" she said. \u201cMainly because there\u2019s just less characters now, so everyone\u2019s got more to do.\u201dWading just a touch deeper, but careful not to spoil anything, Williams told the outlet that her final scene was \"beautiful. I ended on the perfect scene. I was alone \u2013 shocker! Arya\u2019s always bloody alone. But I was alone and I had watched a lot of other people wrap. I knew the drill, I had seen the tears and heard the speeches.\u201d She, too, gave an unplanned speech as she wrapped \u2014 \"in that moment I realized what the show meant to me\" \u2014 then appropriately marked the occasion with a nice meal and \"a lot of sake.\"The eighth and final season of Game of Thrones premieres on HBO sometime in 2019.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
