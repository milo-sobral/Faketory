Though it's an obscure name for a genre, it makes immediately sense after getting to know Donna and her music on\u00a0TRL.With her booming\u00a0voice and powerful lyrics, Donna blew everyone away in\u00a0TRL's Times Square studio with her performance of \"Keep Lying\" off her new album,\u00a0This Time. Check out\u00a0Donna's must-hear style of \"feminist stripper music\" below.\u00a0TRL\u00a0airs on weekdays at 8:00am ET.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
