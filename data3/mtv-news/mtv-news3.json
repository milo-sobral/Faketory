But as she gears up for this life change, she's also grown increasingly worried about her son's disability. During the premiere episode, Bri blamed herself for her son\u2019s missing arm, which she said last season was a result of amniotic band syndrome, or constricted growth while he was in utero. From there, the mother-son duo met with a therapist from Easterseals, a local organization that provides developmental activities to physically challenged babies. But when Brianna learned her eight-month-old wasn\u2019t hitting some of the milestones that other babies his age were -- like crawling -- she worried about the implications of his birth defect.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s hard to watch him struggle,\u201d she told her therapist. \u201cI know that he\u2019s getting frustrated... He wants to do it, and that\u2019s what makes me feel the worst.\u201dBrianna then admitted she wants answers surrounding his disability, if nothing more than to put her mind at ease.\u201cIt made no sense to me. Like, why would this happen? But it happened. I feel like it was my fault\u2026 but even just knowing why it happened would kind of be peace of mind,\" she said.Luckily, the therapist said Braeson can still get treatment even when they move out to Oregon, but will Brianna get over her guilt?
