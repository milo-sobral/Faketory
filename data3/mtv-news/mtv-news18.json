{"id": "\n\n                Will Teen Mom OG's Cheyenne and Zach Learn A Lesson From Their BBQ Blowup?\n              \n\n", "paragraph": "\n              The couple kissed and made up -- then vowed to do better\n        \n          Cheyenne\u2019s first family gathering on Teen Mom OG was pretty eventful, to say the least -- she and her dad had a tiff after he found out that she and her boyfriend Zach were living together. But after the dust settled on that fight, we saw Cheyenne getting upset with Zach on this week\u2019s installment. The reason: She felt disrespected that he didn't kick out his friend Mailk, who had a bit too much to drink.\u201cShe\u2019s on my case, like, 'Get him out of here,'\u201d Zach told his friends. \u201cThis is my homie; I grew up with him. Before I kick you out, I\u2019m going to ask you what\u2019s going on.\u201dChey then charged at Zach and told him to leave, just before all the guys fled. Thankfully, though, the couple reconvened and talked it out after the situation calmed down.\u201cI just need you to understand I\u2019m here for you...I don\u2019t want you to think I had his back before I had yours,\u201d Zach told Chey. \u201cI don\u2019t like to handle things dramatically.\u201dChey\u2019s response? \u201cI\u2019m just a tad bit more dramatic. I\u2019m happy that we are able to sit down and have a conversation about it. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t have a problem. It was more just Malik and the situation. Moving forward, we both have to communicate better.\u201dDo you think the couple will learn from this experience, especially now that they\u2019re roommates? Or is this a short-term resolution?
