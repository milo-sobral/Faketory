And no, it wasn't his dick, like he joked about during the initial sit-down with  hosts Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi and Nico Tortorella.\"If you know your Game of Thrones, they're called crows,\" Paulie told her, as she examined her new ribs. \"I wanted to make sure it was flying, symbolic of how you like to be free and how I like to keep you free so that you never want to leave me.\" Then, referencing the location of Final Reckoning, he added, \"Which then comes in to a deeper meaning of the coordinates right here of where we met in South Africa.\" But there was one more significant detail: A little red heart in the middle of the crow.\"Even though we like to tiptoe around a lot of things, I wanted to tell you that I loved you,\" he told her as they hugged. He continued: \"Even though you tattooed a picture of yourself on me, you're going to have to do a little bit more than that to get rid of me.\"Speaking of her design: She opted to put her Dirty 30 cast photo on his thigh, which was inspired by him making a joke that he would get it tattooed on himself.
