And now, hours of conversations, activism, and organizing all come down to the critical last few days on the campaign trail convincing voters to head to the polls.Not sure if there\u2019s much you can do this late in the game to get out the vote? The last weekend before Election Day is crucial for ensuring democracy is alive and well on Tuesday. Here\u2019s what you can do to make sure everyone is exercising their right to vote and picking the representatives they want.Talk to Your NetworkDo you know for sure if your family members are voting? What about your friends? How about any co-workers? Have they double-checked if they\u2019re registered to vote? Do they know where their polling places are? Do they have transportation to and from wherever they\u2019re casting their votes? Have they checked out a sample ballot for their district? Do they know all of the down-ballot candidates and ballot initiatives?Don\u2019t trust that everyone has their Election Day plan figured out. Take initiative and talk to your friends, family, and co-workers. \u201cNothing beats the old fashioned face to face contact especially when people are hiding digital ads on FB and fast forwarding through TV ads,\u201d says Atima Omara, Founder and President of Omara Strategy Group.If the people in your personal network don\u2019t know who or what they\u2019re voting for on Election Day, they can use great resources like BallotReady to see every race that will appear on their ballot, discover the candidates and their views on major issues, and learn about the other ballot measures that they\u2019ll be voting on.Phone BankWhether you live in a swing district or an area without a competitive race, phone banking allows people in all parts of the country to connect with voters. It\u2019s especially important to have a quick check-in with voters to make sure they\u2019re heading to the polls come Tuesday.For those who live outside of key districts, many campaigns have remote phone banking operations to allow supporters to phone bank from anywhere in the country and reach out to get out the vote. If you have questions, campaigns often list their upcoming phone banking sessions on their websites (if not, you can usually email a campaign for more info). Moreover, many local political groups across the country organize their own phone banking sessions for competitive races and provide call sheets with names and phone numbers of voters and scripts for what to say, so you can join pre-existing efforts to get out the vote via phone and get all the instruction you need.Knock on DoorsArguably the most impactful actions people can take leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, however, is spending face-to-face time with voters directly canvassing neighborhoods and speaking on the candidates and issues you care about.\u201cThe power of showing up at someone's door, telling them about a candidate you believe in, and helping them make a plan to vote cannot be overstated,\u201d says Marisa Kabas of Crush The Midterms, a digital tool that helps people make personalized plans for supporting competitive campaigns.For people who\u2019ve never canvassed before, the process can seem overwhelming. However, campaign staffers have onboarded countless volunteers over the years to help get out the vote, so you\u2019re in good hands. \u201c[Canvassing] is incredibly easy and the campaign will give you a quick training before you head out, so you don't need any prior experience,\u201d explains Monica Klein, Founding Partner of Seneca Strategies, a progressive political consulting firm. \u201cThere is nothing more meaningful or satisfying than convincing a voter [who] was on the fence to support your candidate. You don\u2019t want to see the results roll in after the polls close and wish you had helped get out the vote.\u201dKabas says that it\u2019s also critical to remember that while every interaction over the weekend may not be a positive one, your work is important. \u201cNot everyone will be receptive. Not everyone will be nice. You might get a couple of slammed doors,\u201d she notes. \u201cBut if you spend even two hours knocking doors in your community or a community nearby\u2014this weekend, Monday, or even on Election Day\u2014there's a high probability that you'll encourage a couple of people to turnout. That's everything.\u201d\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved. MTV and all related titles and logos are trademarks of Viacom International Inc."}
