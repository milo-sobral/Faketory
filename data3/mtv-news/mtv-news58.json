From the elderly white couple with a kidnapped man in their trunk, the doctor who frequents a strip club, and the mom who moonlights as a dominatrix, everyone's secrets come to light. .Paak and Kendrick, for their part, change clothes, settings, and characters throughout the clip, which also features a cameo from Dr. Dre (and the Grim Reaper).Along with releasing the \"Tints\" video on Friday (October 26), .Paak also revealed the tracklist for his fourth album, Oxnard, which arrives on November 16. The Dr. Dre-produced project includes previously released tracks \"Bubblin\" and \"Til It's Over,\" and also boasts features from Snoop Dogg, J. Cole, Pusha T, Q-Tip, BJ the Chicago Kid, and more.
