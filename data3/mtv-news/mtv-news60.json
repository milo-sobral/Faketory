The Queen rapper spared no drama while opening the star-studded awards show, kicking off the festivities with slick choreo, sparks, and Britain's hottest girl group.Nicki's performance got underway in theatrical fashion, with cloaked figures forming a circle around the stage. As chants of \"majesty\" filled the arena in Bilbao, Spain, she descended from the ceiling surrounded by showers of golden sparks and wearing an embellished pink leotard. She and her crew of dancers launched right into the Queen cut \"Good Form,\" before ceding the stage to Little Mix, who busted out some Michael Jackson-esque moves for their empowering new single, \"Woman Like Me.\" Naturally, Nicki chimed in with her verse before joining the girls for an explosive final chorus, punctuated by a sassy claw move. NM + LM = EMA royalty.Earlier in the night, Minaj took home the EMA for Best Look, besting fellow nominees Dua Lipa, Migos, Post Malone, and Cardi B.
