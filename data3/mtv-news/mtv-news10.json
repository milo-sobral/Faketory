First up on the programming slate: Cooking in the Crib with Snooki & Joey. This nine-episode series features everyone\u2019s favorite Jersey girl in the kitchen whipping up some delights. But unlike every other cooking show out there, Cooking in the Crib with Snooki & Joey has a host who chooses each week\u2019s recipe and has none of the skills required to actually make said dish. Relying on the help of her BFF Joey Camasta -- and a rotating cast of guests to do the work behind the stove -- each installment features Snooki attempting to learn how to make a dish along with the audience. Bring on the hopefully tasty cuisine!But that's not all: Moms with Attitude features Snooki and her bestie Jenni \"JWOWW\" Farley as they share musings about motherhood, sex and drinking. Meanwhile, \"Sneak Peeks,\" debuting today, is a first-look preview at new linear episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. And Joey Reacts to the Jersey Shore, coming on October 29, stars Camasta as he reacts to all the past epic hookups, blowouts and WTF moments from the shore.Visit the Jersey Shore YouTube channel here -- and be sure to keep watching Jersey Shore: Family Vactation Part 2 every Thursday at 8/7c!\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
