After all, there are more women, people of color, LGBTQ+ Americans, and young people running for office than ever before\u2014and many have a great shot of winning.Which statewide and federal races in particular should you keep an eye on? Here are nine that could have ripple effects across the country and set up a new line of \u201cfirsts\u201d for the nation.Ilhan Omar (D) and Jennifer Zielinski (R)Minnesota 5th Congressional DistrictIlhan Omar made headlines in 2016 after becoming the United States\u2019 first Somali-American legislator, and she has a high chance of becoming the first Somali-American congressperson in Minnesota\u2019s left-leaning 5th congressional district. \u201cMy election win offers a counter-narrative to the bigotry in the world,\u201d she said after her victory for state office two years ago. \u201cThis is a land of immigrants, and most come here for opportunity, a second chance. It\u2019s our time to fight for the America we know we can have.\u201dAndrew Gillum (D) and Ron DeSantis (R)Florida GovernorFlorida could potentially elect its first Black governor this month. Progressive Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum is facing off against proud Trump supporter and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis. Unsurprisingly, the race hasn\u2019t been without its clashes. DeSantis kicked of day one of the general election campaign saying he didn\u2019t want voters to \u201cmonkey this up,\u201d leading Democrats in the state to say that DeSantis\u2019 remark was racist. Gillum later addressed the issue at a debate, talking about DeSantis\u2019 record of working neo-Nazis and white supremacists. \u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist,\u201d he the crowd.Kyrsten Sinema (D) and Martha McSally (R)Arizona SenateIf elected, Kyrsten Sinema\u2014who\u2019s who\u2019s consistently had a slight lead on Republican Martha McSally in polls\u2014would become the first openly bisexual member of the Senate, and only the second openly LGBTQ+ member of the Senate ever. Currently as a U.S. Representative, she\u2019s part of a tiny contingent of openly LGBTQ+ congressional members\u2014which is only seven people strong out of 535 reps and senators.Abby Finkenauer (D) and Rod Blum (R)Iowa 1st Congressional DistrictThe race in Iowa\u2019s 1st congressional district has been overlooked by many, but there\u2019s a lot happening here: Democrat Abby Finkenauer is 29 and part of a small number of Millennials running for Congress. If she wins, she'll be one of the youngest representatives\u2014and one of few under 40.Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R)Georgia GovernorThe Georgia gubernatorial race is virtually tied, and history\u2019s on the line. If elected, Democrat Stacey Abrams would be the first Black woman governor ever. The race is particularly contentious given allegations that Brian Kemp, who\u2019s currently Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State, is actively suppressing voters likely to support Abrams. Some reports estimate that Kemp\u2019s team has invalidated 1.4 million voter registrations over the past six years. More recently, the Associated Press reported that Kemp had blocked 53,000 voter registrations ahead of the election, 70% of which were from Black voters, who are more likely to support Abrams.Lauren Underwood (D) and Randy Hultgren (R)Illinois 14th Congressional DistrictLauren Underwood, a nurse and one of only a few Millennials\u2014not to mention, young people of color\u2014is still in the running for Congress after beating out six older white men for the Democratic nomination in the Chicago suburb; she received more votes in the primary than all of them combined. She has a tough race ahead of her against Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren, but pollsters say she\u2019s cut into his lead in recent weeks.Beto O'Rourke (D) and Ted Cruz (R)Texas SenateDemocratic Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke is giving Senator Ted Cruz\u2014a Republican incumbent running for re-election in the red state of Texas\u2014a run for his money. Not only has O\u2019Rourke raised an earth-shattering $70.2 million for his campaign and had an appearance on Ellen Degeneres\u2019 show following a viral video of him discussing players kneeling at NFL games, but plenty of demographics are also now swinging in his favor. Young voter turnout in the state, for example, has increased over 500% since 2014.Sharice Davids (D) and Kevin Yoder (R)Kansas 3rd Congressional DistrictHistory could be made in Kansas\u2019 3rd congressional district: Sharice Davids, along with Deb Haaland in New Mexico's 1st congressional district, could be one of the first Native American women ever sent to Congress. If elected, Davids, a Democrat, will represent a district that\u2019s had Republican representatives for 45 of the past 57 years.Liuba Grechen Shirley (D) and Peter King (R)New York 2nd Congressional DistrictDemocrat Liuba Grechen Shirley made headlines this year after she became the first woman to successfully petition the FEC to let her use campaign funds for childcare. Her actions led to a number of other women challenging campaign finance rules in their states\u2014with varying levels of success\u2014to do the same.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc.
