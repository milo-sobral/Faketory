But now that she's seen the movie and heard her song during the fan-favorite hot tub scene, she's happy to confirm that star Noah Centineo is one of her celebrity crushes.With streams of \"Lovers\" skyrocketing a year after its release, it only made sense for Anna to perform the song from\u00a0TRL's Times Square studio. Relive the hot tub scene and watch Anna take the stage below.\u00a0TRL\u00a0airs on weekdays at 8:00am on MTV.\u00a0\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
