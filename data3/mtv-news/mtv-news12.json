Before\u00a0 performing their joint-track \"We Got Everything,\" the duo had a candid conversation about what it means to win, noting how there's nothing better than the feedback, getting stopped in the streets and thanked for the music you've created.A little known fact about Styles: for the\u00a0classic Diddy track \"It's All About the Benjamins,\" he actually wrote a verse that was cut from the final track. More than 20 years later, Sway asked Styles P if he's got any hard feelings on being chopped from one of the most definitive songs of the Bad Boy era. It's clear that after all those years, there's no bad blood; Styles P readily admits that a win for one is a win for all. Hear more of\u00a0his thoughts on the verse he wrote for the song\u00a0below.\u00a0TRL\u00a0airs on weekdays at 8:00am ET.\u00a9 2018 Viacom International Inc. All Rights Reserved.
