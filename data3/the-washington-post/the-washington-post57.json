{"id": "President Trump has fact-checkers gasping for air", "paragraph": " Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  The Onion is on top of the news: \u201cNation\u2019s Fact-Checkers Confirm They\u2019ll Probably Wrap Up Evaluating Trump\u2019s Statements By 2050 At Latest.\u201dGlenn Kessler, The Post\u2019s Fact Checker columnist, tells the Erik Wemple Blog, \u201cAt the moment, there are lots of things entered but blank spaces for the fact-checks so we really have to plow through them.\u201dAaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact, says, \u201cWe really have been stretched to the limit. We\u2019ve been asking a fact-checker to staff nights for the past few weeks to \u2018live\u2019 fact check Trump\u2019s remarks on Twitter. We\u2019re just not really able to get to every claim that we might typically wish to verify.\u201dLori Robertson, managing editor of FactCheck.org, says, \u201cIt would be a lot of work to fact-check every single midterm rally and a lot of the stuff he says.\u201dDaniel Dale, Washington bureau chief for the Toronto Star and a fact-checker, says, \u201cI\u2019ve fallen behind because the quantity is so large. It\u2019s an avalanche right now.\u201dOkay, but it\u2019s a misnomer to equate the situation to a natural disaster. This one is man-made. Misinformation \u2014 false statements, misleading statements and, yes, lies \u2014 keep tumbling from the mouth of President Trump. And this being election season, the falsehoods and lies come in bigger doses.\u00a0Factba.se\u00a0breaks down word counts for Trump\u2019s speaking engagements and press appearances, and the word count churned out by recent appearances and interviews is staggering.\u00a0 Trump has:Hundreds of thousands of words \u2014 flimsy and false words \u2014 piling up day after day as part of an effort to deceive just enough people to record a \u201cwin\u201d in the midterm elections.The Post\u2019s Kessler and two other staffers \u2014 Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly \u2014 are charged with sifting through all of them as part of a continuing effort to track the total number of false or misleading claims made by the president. As of Sept. 12, the database had logged 5,001 such claims. According to Kessler, the imperative of amassing a full count originated in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency, propelled by the notion that logging the low-hanging falsehoods would free up the team to do full-on checks of more complicated statements coming from Trump. Instead, the project has become a \u201chuge albatross,\u201d says Kessler. \u201cThere are days where he says 100 or more things that are wrong and with all these interviews and press availabilities and rallies,\u201d there are only so many resources to nail down all the claims. That said, \u201cwe\u2019re very committed to it and we\u2019ve gotten a tremendous reader response.\u201dAt FactCheck.org, Robertson helps oversee* a team of seven fact-checkers, two of whom are tied up with monitoring fake news on Facebook. The five others churn through Trump pronouncements and other stuff in the political arena. Fact-checking all of Trump\u2019s recent utterances is not part of the plan, says Robertson, who has worked with her team to organize them into three baskets: Trump Stump Speeches: Health Care; Trump Stump Speeches: Economy; and Trump Stump Speeches: Immigration. Those baskets are heavy files and cover a lot of counterfactual terrain. \u201cI think we\u2019re comfortable with what we left out, but there\u2019s always something that\u2019s going to be left out,\u201d says Robertson.Especially in this political season. There are 11 rallies planned between now and the Nov. 6 midterm elections, according to Trump\u2019s campaign website. For fact-checkers, that\u2019s a chilling and leisure-stealing prospect. As Dale notes, the rallies are Trump\u2019s \u201cmost dishonest venue.\u201d On his Twitter feed, Dale fact-checks the proceedings in real time, a high-wire act:Trump lies as always that he got the Veterans Choice health program passed after \"44 years\" of non-passage. It was passed under Obama in 2014. Trump signed a law that modified the program.\"We have created almost half a million new manufacturing jobs,\" Trump says of the 378,000 manufacturing jobs added during his presidency, then lies that Obama said there'd be no more manufacturing jobs, which never happened.The plume of false Trump pronouncements in recent months has generated a curiosity: Are the falsehoods spiking because Trump is just talking more, or is he belting out more falsehoods per word? Back in September, Kessler presented the results of an examination of two Trump rallies in Montana, one in July and the other in September. For the first event, 76 percent of the 98 statements were \u201cfalse, misleading or unsupported by the evidence,\u201d versus 70 percent of the 88 statements for the second event.\u201cI found that he is getting more dishonest per word,\u201d says Dale.Professional hazards do attach to this line of work. \u201cIt\u2019s a very\u00a0depressing duty to read through all these speeches and see so many false things or misleading things said over and over again,\u201d says Kessler, who says his team has identified more than 185 false or misleading statements that Trump has repeated more than three times.The president\u2019s persistence is a long-standing strategy. As Trump reportedly told then-entertainment reporter Billy Bush years ago regarding his false claims about ratings for his TV show: \u201cBilly, look, look, you just tell them and they believe it. That\u2019s it, you just tell them and they believe it. They just do,\u201d Trump said, according to Bush.*Clarification: The original language indicated that Robertson \u201chelms\u201d the staff. As managing editor, she is the No. 2 on the masthead, under Director Eugene Kiely. Also updated to note that Robertson \u201cworked with\u201d her team on fact-checking categories, as opposed to having \u201cdirected\u201d it.Read more:E.J. Dionne Jr.: Trump lies. And lies.
