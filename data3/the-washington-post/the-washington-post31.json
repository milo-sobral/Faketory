{"id": "The Trump administration just approved a plan to drill for oil in Alaska\u2019s federal waters. It\u2019s a major first.", "paragraph": "Interior Department officials announced their approval Wednesday of a company\u2019s plan to drill for oil six miles off the Alaskan coast in the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea.If the development by Hilcorp Energy moves forward, it would be the first oil and gas production facility in federal waters in Alaska, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in the announcement, a major victory for the oil industry and a blow to conservation groups that fought it, fearing a possible leak in a sensitive and pristine natural environment.Zinke said the approval was a step forward for President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d agenda that promotes the widespread development and production of fossil fuels such as coal and oil.\u201cAmerican energy dominance is good for the economy, the environment, and our national security,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cResponsibly developing our resources, in Alaska especially, will allow us to use our energy diplomatically to aid our allies and check our adversaries. That makes America stronger and more influential around the globe.\u201dContrary to Zinke\u2019s pitch, the vast majority of scientists say the use of fossil fuels contributes to carbon pollution that fuels climate change, a driver of sea-level rise, warmer oceans and hurricanes that rely on warm water to grow in size and ferocity.Hilcorp, based in Houston, plans to build a nine-acre gravel island about 20 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, not far from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Liberty Project proposes to tap into a reservoir of oil on the state\u2019s North Slope, containing as much as 150 million barrels.The project is expected to take two years to complete, produce up to 70,000 barrels a day at peak production about two years after it begins, with \u201ca life expectancy of 15 to 20 years,\u201d according to the project\u2019s website.Hilcorp, a major player in Alaska, has had a few environmental mishaps. In December 2017, Hilcorp Alaska discovered crude oil leaking from a subsea pipeline that connected a pair of oil production platforms in the Cook Inlet.Nine months before that discovery, the Coast Guard was dispatched to investigate a Hilcorp oil leak from an abandoned well head in the Gulf of Mexico. A news release by the Coast Guard reported \u201can estimated 840 gallons of crude oil in the water,\u201d according to an article in the New Orleans Times Picayune.The article reported that eight months earlier, another Hilcorp pipeline was the source of 4,200 gallons of oil spilled near Lake Grande Ecaille, according to the Coast Guard.Interior never mentions announcements about lease proposals and project approvals, nor does it mention oil company setbacks, including the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, the worst offshore spill in history. The department\u2019s proposal to offer leases to the oil and gas industry on 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf ignored another major spill in the Gulf of Mexico that has lasted 14 years and could continue for 80 more.But oil leaks from pipelines in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet, where Hilcorp is a major operator, became such a problem that the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council launched what it called an unprecedented risk assessment. \u201cThere is a concern because we\u2019re talking about aging infrastructure,\u201d said Lynda Giguere, director of public outreach for the group, founded after the catastrophic 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.Many of the pipelines connecting platforms and facilities onshore are more than a half-century old, Giguere said. \u201cWe need to understand the regulation oversight, the conditions of the infrastructure and the maintenance. It\u2019s part of our mission and it seemed long overdue.\u201dGiguere credited Hilcorp for working with the group and providing the information it needs to conduct its investigation. \u201cThey are the biggest operator in the Cook Inlet region. I can\u2019t answer how much they own, but they are a major operator in the region.\u201dThe Congressional Western Caucus praised the Liberty Project\u2019s approval on Twitter, calling it \u201cexcellent news for the state of Alaska!\u201dA conservation group, the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, disagreed.\u201cOpening the Arctic to offshore oil drilling is a disaster waiting to happen,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, ocean legal director with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThis project sets us down a dangerous path of destroying the Arctic.\""}
