So does the fact that the narrator is a character named Rory Gilmore, an absurdist reference to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d actress Alexis Bledel\u2019s breakout role on \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201dNew York comedians Marcia Belsky and Melissa Stokoski co-created \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale: The Musical,\u201d a parody of Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel and the hit Hulu series adaptation. After a half-dozen performances spread out over the past year, the minimalist production is headed to D.C. for a pair of shows Saturday at the Kennedy Center as part of the annual Bentzen Ball comedy festival.Belsky inhabits the protagonist Offred (played by Elisabeth Moss in the Hulu show), while Stokoski takes on the Rory Gilmore character. The idea for the production took root a year ago, when the friends found themselves watching \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and were so overwhelmed by the show\u2019s bleakness that they could only cope by poking fun at it.\u201cWe started laughing about how everything has become a musical, basically \u2014 how they made \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 into a musical, \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 and all of this stuff \u2014 and how it would be funny if someone did \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 as a musical because it was so dark,\u201d Belsky says. \u201cWe just started joking about that, and then it kind of came together.\u201d[3 ways to laugh at the 2018 Bentzen Ball comedy festival]While the source material imagines a dystopian future in which fertile women are enslaved as child-rearing \u201chandmaids,\u201d this version centers around the decidedly less extreme story of millennials in 2028 Brooklyn whose lives are upended when they\u2019re forced to \u2014 gasp \u2014 hand over their cellphones. In Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Offred is a mother brutally separated from her husband and daughter; here, she\u2019s a cliched musical theater heroine who relocates to New York to fulfill her dream of becoming a barista.\u201cI thought it would be funny to write a show where it doesn\u2019t undermine the message of the seriousness of the handmaid story, but it also pokes fun at what the spoiled, entitled people of my generation might act like in those situations,\u201d Belsky says.Belsky and Stokoski wrote the book and lyrics for \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale: The Musical\u201d in two months before debuting the show this past January, with composer Fernanda Douglas putting together the musical arrangements. As far as the co-creators are concerned, the show is protected by fair-use law regarding parodies \u2014 though they\u2019ve never heard from anyone associated with \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201dAfter the Bentzen Ball, \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale: The Musical\u201d will be staged at least one more time, at next month\u2019s New York Comedy Festival. The creative team also hopes to record a cast album with the ensemble, and an off-Broadway run isn\u2019t off the table should investors emerge.As a politically timely parody \u2014 the complicit and sadistic Aunt Lydia is, for example, reimagined as Aunt Betsy DeVos \u2014 \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale: The Musical\u201d has been updated with each iteration to reflect the news cycle. With the Kennedy Center performances taking place a month after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings thrust the #MeToo movement further into the political spotlight, Belsky hopes this take on \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d can prove particularly therapeutic to a D.C. crowd.\u201cSatire can just be so cathartic and relaxing when as soon as you step out that door and get on Twitter or whatever \u2014 especially in D.C. \u2014 s--- gets real again,\u201d Belsky says. \u201cI want it to be an escape.\u201dKennedy Center, 2700 F St. NW; Sat., 7:30 & 10 p.m., sold out."}
