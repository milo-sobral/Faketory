{"id": "Kanye West says he\u2019s distancing himself from politics: 'I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in\u2019", "paragraph": "The past several months have been quite the wild ride in the land of Kanye West news. His comments about slavery being a choice, calls to abolish the 13th Amendment and outspoken admiration for President Trump, much to the chagrin of many of his fans, all came to a head with his bizarre, televised Oval Office meeting with the president earlier this month.Just this weekend, he had been credited with designing the logo for shirts connected to \u201cBlexit,\u201d a call for African Americans to leave the Democratic Party that has been championed by Candace Owens, the spokeswoman for the pro-Trump organization Turning Point USA.Now, West is apparently cutting off all political ties. In tweets posted Tuesday, he seemingly attempted to retreat from many of the claims, statements, social media snippets and interviews that have characterized his public persona in recent months.\u201cMy eyes are now wide open and now realize I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!\u201dMy eyes are now wide open and now realize I\u2019ve been used to spread messages I don\u2019t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!Perhaps the tipping point came this weekend. That\u2019s when the \u201cBlexit\u201d merchandise was unveiled during Turning Point USA\u2019s Young Black Leadership Summit.\"Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West,\u201d said Owens, an activist in the pro-Trump Internet, according to Page Six.But West tweeted that he didn\u2019t actually design the logo and he wants nothing to do with \u201cBlexit.\u201dI introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn\u2019t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.Before tweeting about the \u201cBlexit\u201d drama, West fired off messages about the current state of his political stances.I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most, I support prison reform, I support common-sense gun laws that will make our world safer.I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable. I believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who are fighting to protect their children from violence and war.It\u2019s unclear what prompted the sudden tweeting, but he seems to imply that his family and friends \u2014 who support his \u201cACTUAL beliefs\u201d \u2014 might be involved.I would like to thank my family, loved ones, and community for supporting my ACTUAL beliefs and my vision for a better world.West has long been prone to public outbursts. But it felt a little different at a concert in 2016 when he surprised his fans by claiming that he would have voted for Trump \u2014 if he had voted at all. He also stormed offstage during another concert.Days later, he was hospitalized for stress and exhaustion at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, and the remainder of his tour dates were canceled.West remained out of the spotlight for a while, even deleting his Twitter account. He returned to the social media platform in April to announce several albums. He also said he was writing a philosophy book titled \u201cBreak the Simulation,\u201d only to later reveal that the philosophy book was actually his tweets.Among these tweets was one that read \u201cI love the way Candace Owens thinks.\u201d Owens, who once used the social media handle \u201cRed Pill Black,\u201d has argued that the media has brainwashed black people to vote for Democrats.During the same period, West appeared to again express support for Trump, tweeting a photo of a signed red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. He even released a song in which he and rapper T.I. debate West\u2019s admiration for Trump.West also used the cover of his \u201cYe\u201d album to express that he had bipolar disorder, though he later told the president in their White House meeting that he had been misdiagnosed.But perhaps the most provocative thing West did in the past few months was imply during an interview with TMZ that slavery was a choice made by the enslaved.\u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years \u2014 for 400 years?\u201d West said. \u201cThat sounds like a choice. Like, you was there for 400 years, and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all? It\u2019s like we\u2019re mentally in prison.\u201d"}
