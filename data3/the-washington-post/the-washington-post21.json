{"id": "Tumbling markets complicate Trump\u2019s midterm messaging", "paragraph": "U.S. stock markets fell sharply Wednesday, erasing all gains for the year and muddying one of President Trump\u2019s favorite talking points two weeks before the midterm elections.The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.4\u00a0percent Wednesday, its worst one-day drop since the financial crisis. The index has slid more than 12\u00a0percent since the end of August. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which tracks a broader group of U.S. companies, has lost $2\u00a0trillion in value since late September, down 9\u00a0percent. The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, lost 608 points Wednesday and is down 8.3\u00a0percent in the past three weeks.The financial swoon threatens to undermine a market rise for which Trump has frequently claimed credit and to highlight controversial aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda, including tariffs many companies are blaming for their struggles and a tax cut that polls suggest the public views as inadequately helpful for the middle class.[Dow plunges more than 600 points in another day of losses]Trump has increasingly looked to shift focus away from economic indicators he once touted and toward immigration and other issues \u2014 and assign blame elsewhere for any economic setbacks.He has pummeled the Federal Reserve, alleging higher interest rates pose the biggest risk to growth \u2014 even musing he might have made a mistake when he nominated Jerome H. Powell as the nation\u2019s top central banker less than a year ago. It is unusual for a president to attack the central bank \u2014 the Fed aims to maintain independence from the White House to avoid the taint of politics on its economic decisions.Trump has also promised a 10\u00a0percent middle-class tax cut, a proposal that caught his aides by surprise and that lawmakers said was exceedingly unlikely in the near future.In recent days, Trump has suggested he could mobilize the military to protect the southern border from a caravan of migrants, But he has said little about the recent stock-market movement.\u201cThe president is very good at manipulating the narrative and getting people \u2014 either through traditional media or social media \u2014 to focus on what he wants them to focus on,\u201d said Brian Gardner, managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank.Trump\u2019s focus on immigration and his surprise proposal for a middle-class tax cut come as the strong economy exhibits signs of strain.Beyond the slumping market, rates on 30-year mortgages are climbing, with many loans now eclipsing 5\u00a0percent. Higher interest rates can limit borrowing, slowing home sales and the economy. And multiple businesses \u2014 including firms that Trump has praised, such as Harley-Davidson and United Technologies \u2014 are warning that the White House\u2019s trade strategy could cost them millions of dollars in revenue.Forty-eight S&P 500 companies mentioned \u201ctariffs\u201d during calls with analysts in recent days, many warning that they threaten to cause a drag on the economy.Trump has dismissed complaints from chief executives about the White House\u2019s trade policy, telling the Wall Street Journal that overpaid executives will not take responsibility for their own bad decisions.\u201cI have created such an incredible economy,\u201d Trump said in Montana last week. \u201cI have created so many jobs.\u201dTrump said repeatedly during the summer that the United States was experiencing the greatest economy in its history, largely citing the low unemployment rate. And Tuesday, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he falsely denied imposing any tariffs on imports, even though he has implemented numerous tariffs against a range of countries this year.His comments to the Journal directly contradict his Twitter post from a few hours earlier, in which he said the tariffs he had launched were bringing billions of dollars into the government\u2019s coffers. Trump has mischaracterized the way tariffs work, suggesting they are paid by other countries rather than by U.S. companies that import the products \u2014 often passing those costs to U.S. consumers.White House officials have denied that Trump\u2019s recent behavior is driven by concerns about a weakening economy, saying the new tax plan, despite its surprise rollout, is meant to build on last year\u2019s tax law and help the middle class. And a number of senior officials have said the fundamentals of the economy remain strong, and the White House has an upbeat outlook for next year.\u201cOur job is to focus on what the economic numbers say, and the numbers are very solid right now,\u201d Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cIf your policies have produced the numbers we are observing, then you shouldn\u2019t duck.\u201dDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist, said the new tax-cut announcement struck many as an act of knee-jerk desperation.\u201cI don\u2019t think it helps to have the president invent a tax cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThat looks panicky. That hurts the larger effort. That wasn\u2019t the White House. That was him.\u201dJob growth during Trump\u2019s presidency is roughly comparable to the last four years of the Obama administration, though the jobless rate is lower and economic growth has picked up. Economists are mixed on whether this is sustainable, with some cautioning the gains from tax cuts and higher federal spending are temporary.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say [Trump is] trying to set the Fed up for the fall here, but a lot of people were warning that the president was taking a risk and Republicans were taking a risk by putting forward a bunch of fiscal stimulus at this point in the business cycle,\u201d said James Pethokoukis, a policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.New-home sales sank for the fourth straight month in September, reflecting the impact of mortgage rates that now top 5\u00a0percent for many borrowers.Sales of new single-family homes last month fell 5.5\u00a0percent from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 553,000, according to a government report. September\u2019s sales volume was more than 13\u00a0percent lower than the same month one year earlier, and figures for June, July and August were also revised down.Though the strong labor market is likely to support demand, some economists are beginning to worry about collateral damage from a housing downturn.\u201cThe economy cannot grow at a sustainable 3\u00a0percent pace for long if new-home sales continue to tumble,\u201d warned economist Chris Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank.Many executives had hoped trade fights with China and other countries would be resolved swiftly, but it appears a number of disagreements will drag into at least next year.The $260\u00a0billion in tariffs Trump unleashed on Beijing took effect in this year\u2019s third quarter, covering roughly half of what the United States buys from China.American companies have warned for months that Trump\u2019s trade war with China and other nations could wrench their bottom lines, and now they are quantifying that damage in dour earnings reports.Ford recently reported levies on metals will shave $1\u00a0billion off the automaker\u2019s profits, while consumer-goods giant Honeywell said it expects to absorb \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in new duty-related costs.Minnesota manufacturer 3M projected a loss next year of $100\u00a0million, blaming \u201ctariff head winds.\u201d Caterpillar shares took the sharpest dive in seven years after the tractor maker said the commercial battle between the world\u2019s two largest economies was driving up the price of steel.Walmart cautioned that prices could swell because a third of the products on its shelves arrive from outside the United States \u2014 and many are labeled \u201cMade in China.\u201dUnited Technologies, which once lauded Trump for saving its Carrier subsidiary\u2019s Indianapolis furnace factory, has changed its public stance on the president\u2019s economic moves, saying his flurry of levies will sting to the tune of $200\u00a0million.And Harley-Davidson said this week the duties will zap $20\u00a0million out of its wallet this year and that retaliatory tariffs from the European Union could deal an additional $45\u00a0million blow.More than a third of the 110 S&P 500 companies that have shared third-quarter earnings since Tuesday have discussed the impact of higher border taxes during their conference calls with analysts, according to the investor research group FactSet.Some companies have appealed directly to the administration, urging Trump to lower the trade barriers before the burden falls on American shoppers.\u201cAs the largest retailer in the United States and a major buyer of U.S. manufactured goods, we are very concerned about the impacts these tariffs would have on our business, our customers, our suppliers and the U.S. economy as a whole,\u201d Walmart wrote in a late-September letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer.Several economic factors could converge in the coming weeks to put more pressure on growth, including a decision from Powell about whether to again raise a key borrowing rate in December and an expected fight over federal spending levels. The results of those could give investors and households a new perspective on Trump\u2019s stewardship of an economy that looks much different from its appearance one year ago.Offering one of the last snapshots of the economy before the midterm elections, the government is scheduled to release economic data Friday that measures how much the economy grew from July through September. Analysts diverge strongly on how strong or weak the report will be. David J. Lynch contributed to this report. "}
