On Wednesday, a Montana federal judge denied Anglin\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, holding that speech in encouraging anti-Semitic harassment was not entitled to First Amendment protection.The Montana mother found herself in Anglin\u2019s crosshairs in late 2016, after Richard Spencer, a household name in the alt-right movement, gained notoriety when a video of him shouting \u201cHail Trump!\u201d at a conference of nearly 300 white nationalists \u2014 and the Nazi salutes it elicited \u2014 went viral.Spencer\u2019s mother, Sherry Spencer, owned a ski home in the otherwise idyllic town of Whitefish, Mont. After facing local protests related to her son\u2019s views, she reached out to Gersh, who in 2016 worked as a real estate agent, about selling the property.Subsequently, court filings allege, Sherry Spencer decided not to sell. Months later, she published a blog post on Medium, accusing Gersh of extortion, threats and denouncing her son\u2019s views.The next day, Anglin called his own readers to action.\u201cAre y\u2019all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm?\u201d Anglin wrote in a Dec. 16, 2016, post on the Daily Stormer website. The article, titled \u201cJews Targeting Richard Spencer\u2019s Mother for Harassment and Extortion \u2014 TAKE ACTION!,\u201d was the first of 30 about Gersh on the neo-Nazi site.Anglin also relayed a set of instructions: \u201cJust make your opinions known. Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda.\u201dTo assist his white nationalist reader \u201cfam,\u201d Anglin doxed Gersh, her family and friends, publishing their personal contact information online, including phone numbers and email addresses.Southern Poverty Law Center attorney J. Richard Cohen, who filed the suit on Gersh\u2019s behalf, told The Washington Post, \u201cIn the old days, maybe the Klan would burn a cross on your lawn to intimidate you. Nowadays neo-Nazis have other ways to harass and intimidate.\u201dGersh immediately began receiving hundreds of violent and hate-filled phone calls, emails, voice mails, texts and social media posts. There were death threats, and messages that threatened to drive her to the brink of suicide.Anglin and his followers even targeted Gersh\u2019s 12-year-old son. According to attorney David Dinielli, also of the SPLC, one Twitter user suggested the child look inside an oven for a free Xbox \u2014 a reference to the gas chambers used during the Holocaust in Nazi death camps. Anglin himself posted an image with Gersh and her son\u2019s face superimposed on a photograph of the Auschwitz concentration camp.Court documents note that by spring 2017, the family had received more than 700 violent and threatening communications.\u201cThe trollers used every root to terrorize [Gersh],\u201d Dinielli told The Post, calling it \u201cintrusion into seclusion.\u201d \u201cShe had to erase her presence on the Internet and entirely retreat from her life.\u201dIn his court filings, Anglin argued that the First Amendment protects his posts on the Daily Stormer and that he could not be held responsible for his readers\u2019 actions.Chief Judge Dana L. Christensen, of the U.S. District Court in Missoula, Mont., disagreed.Christensen\u2019s decision noted that Anglin\u2019s attack on Gersh was not to inform the public about a matter of public concern. More, the evidence seemed to show that the publisher goaded his readers, anticipating their reaction to his call to arms.\u201cAnglin did not use speech about Gersh to raise awareness for issues consonant with the alt-right agenda,\u201d Christensen said in his written opinion. Instead, Anglin drew on \u201chis readers' hatred and fear of Jews, rousing their political sympathies.\u201d He called for \u201cconfrontation\u201d and \u201caction.\u201dChristensen said, \u201cAnglin exploited the prejudices widely held among his readers to specifically target one individual.\u201dMarc Randazza, Anglin\u2019s attorney, declined to speak with The Post, though the New York Times reported that he called Christensen\u2019s decision dangerous for free speech.Wednesday\u2019s decision does not end the case, which will proceed to discovery and trial phases. Gersh\u2019s lawyers still must prove that Anglin is liable for invasion of privacy, among other claims.\u201cThere is no First Amendment right to call upon hundreds of thousands of readers to launch a public attack on a private individual with the intent of ruining her life. That\u2019s simply not something that our Constitution protects,\u201d attorney Dinielli said.Successful litigation could offer an avenue of recourse \u2014 though a time-consuming and costly one \u2014 for victims of online harassment and trolling.Hiding behind a keyboard is an insufficient mask, Dinielli said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find you and the courts will hold you accountable.\u201dRead more:A man shouted \u2018Heil Hitler' and \u2018Heil Trump\u2019 during \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 \u2014 and people fledRepublicans attack Jewish candidates across the U.S. with an age-old caricature: Fistfuls of cashLong-forgotten Einstein letter that predicted threat of anti-Semitism reemerges with ominous messageApologizing for Canada\u2019s rejection of Jews in 1939, Trudeau vows to fight anti-Semitism\u2018We were never taught\u2019: Young Jews in the U.S. encounter anti-Semitism firsthand Sign up for email updates from the \"Confronting the Caliphate\" series.
