{"id": "President campaigns for former foe at Nevada rally", "paragraph": " ELKO, Nev. \u2014 Before President Trump\u2019s improbable victory nearly two years ago, Dean Heller, this state\u2019s Republican senator, told reporters that \u201cI vehemently oppose\u201d the GOP\u2019s nominee and gave a campaign contribution from Trump to charity. But on Saturday, here in this small, conservative mining town in northeastern Nevada, Heller couldn\u2019t stop showering Trump with praise as he faces the final stretch of a tough reelection bid.\u201cWelcome to Trump country!\u201d the senator said as he walked onto the stage, introduced warmly by the person Heller would not admit he voted for until nearly seven months into Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cMr. President, this is not the swamp. Now, Mr. President, you know a little bit about gold. In fact, I think everything you touch turns to gold.\u201d\u00a0Trump had introduced the senator in kind, thanking Heller for his support for his two Supreme Court picks \u2014 Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 and his work on veterans\u2019 issues and on the Republican tax bill that was signed into law late last year. In the tax fight, \u201cthere was nobody tougher, there was nobody smarter,\u201d Trump said.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to introduce a man that I spent a long time getting to know,\u201d Trump said, acknowledging their initial tumultuous relationship. \u201cAt first, I fought him. I said, \u2018This guy\u2019s tough. What\u2019s the story here?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u00a0But the men eventually came to understand each other, Trump said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no better partner that I had in Washington than Dean Heller.\u201dSaturday marked the first day of early voting in Nevada, a crucial state in the presidential nominating contests that is also home to one of the most competitive Senate races this year.\u00a0Heller is the sole GOP senator running for reelection in a state that Trump opponent Hillary Clinton won in 2016. He is facing a robust challenge from Democrat Jacky Rosen for a seat that both parties are fighting for with an eye on the Senate majority. Polls show a tight race.\u00a0Creating a campaign-ready image, Heller and Trump together walked off Air Force One just steps away from the rally site. Heller had flown with Trump from Scottsdale, Ariz., where the president had stayed after campaigning on behalf of Arizona GOP Senate candidate Martha McSally in Mesa.At the Nevada rally, Trump called Heller\u2019s opponent \u201cWacky Jacky\u201d and warned against handing control of Congress to Democrats. Trump was optimistic on the Republicans\u2019 prospects next month, arguing that \u201cI think that blue wave is being rapidly shattered.\u201d\u201cThe people of Nevada are going to reelect Senator Dean Heller to protect your jobs, defend your borders and continue making America great again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense.\u201d Trump was referring to the hundreds of central American migrants who were trying to cross into Mexico this weekend on their way to the U.S. border.The rest of the 56-minute rally, held outside by the town\u2019s airport against the backdrop of mountains, was Trump\u2019s standard red-meat campaign fare, as he proudly touted the nation\u2019s economy, taunted Democrats and warned of the dangers of illegal immigration.\u00a0Under the intense desert sun, Trump quipped: \u201cI\u2019ll end up with a nice tan.\u201dTrump also campaigned on behalf of Adam Laxalt, the state\u2019s attorney general, who is running for governor against Democrat Steve Sisolak, the Clark County commissioner.Shortly after the rally, Trump said Republicans are planning to implement a \u201cvery major tax cut\u201d for middle-income earners before next month, even though Congress is out of session until after November\u2019s midterm elections.He did not go into specifics of the plan, but said the cuts would be done \u201csometime just prior, I would say, to November.\u201d It was not clear what Trump was referring to, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.\u201cWe are going to be putting in and are studying very deeply right now, around the clock, a major tax cut for middle-income people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot for business at all. For middle-income people.\u201d\u00a0Saturday also gave way to a political split screen of sorts in Nevada. More than six hours south of this remote town of 20,000 people, former vice president Joe Biden rallied on behalf of Democratic candidates in a Las Vegas event sponsored by the state party, the Latino Victory Fund and the Culinary Workers Union \u2014 a powerful force in Nevada Democratic politics.\u00a0\u201cThese guys are not good guys. This is not your father\u2019s Republican Party,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cI travel the world a lot .\u2009.\u2009. they look at me and they wonder what the hell is going on in America. Ripping infants from their mothers\u2019 arms at the border. What are we doing? What have we become?\u201d\u00a0Shortly after, in Elko, Trump claimed that Biden\u2019s event attracted just 193 people, although reporters on the ground said the figure was in the multiple hundreds.\u00a0Trump attacked Biden as \u201c1\u00a0percent Joe\u201d \u2014 referring to Biden\u2019s low level of support in his previous presidential bids \u2014 adding, \u201cand then [President Barack] Obama came along and took him off the trash heap and made him vice president.\u201dThe rally in Elko was Trump\u2019s third and final one in his three-day campaign swing out West this week, stumping on behalf of House and Senate Republican candidates. He\u2019ll be on the road again Monday to campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in Houston. Matt Viser in Las Vegas contributed to this report. "}
