{"id": "Republicans turn Kavanaugh into an election-year rallying cry", "paragraph": "Republicans installed Brett M. Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, then they turned him into an election-year rallying cry.In the sprint to next week\u2019s midterms, the GOP has used Kavanaugh and his fight for Senate confirmation amid allegations of sexual assault to energize Republican voters in districts and states won by President Trump in 2016. They have cast Kavanaugh as a wrongly accused family man \u2014 the victim of an overzealous #MeToo movement and Democrats seeking retribution for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss.Republicans hope voters will turn out to defend what they believe the conservative justice represents \u2014 traditional values under threat and the dangers of what some have called the liberal \u201cmob.\u201d\u201cThis is the number one issue, I think, for America in November,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a vocal Kavanaugh defender, said this month on Fox News.\u201cDo you agree with what they did to Brett Kavanaugh? Do you believe that what they did was okay? And if you believe it was okay, vote Democrat. If you thought it was despicable, vote for us,\u201d Graham said.Trump has invoked Kavanaugh repeatedly at campaign rallies across the country this month, calling the accusations \u2014 which Kavanaugh has vehemently denied \u2014 a political setup by Democrats.\u201cBoy, oh, did they treat him horribly,\u201d Trump said this past weekend in Murphysboro, Ill. \u201cDid they treat him badly. A great scholar, a great intellect, a great person, great family.\u201dUsing a recent refrain, Trump said the midterm elections would be about \u201cthe caravans, the Kavanaughs, law and order, tax cuts and .\u2009.\u2009. common sense, because most of it is common sense.\u201dPeter Irons, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego who studies the Supreme Court, said Republicans\u2019 politicization of Kavanaugh is almost without precedent.\u201cHardly any Supreme Court nominees have been turned into campaign issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Kavanaugh is unique in that sense.\u201dIrons added that increased politicization is a \u201cvery real danger\u201d for the high court in general.\u201cEveryone\u2019s saying you\u2019ve got five Republicans and four Democrats and they\u2019re going to act in very predictable ways. By and large, this has become a very defining issue in appealing to voters,\u201d he said.The elevation of Kavanaugh as a campaign issue comes after a bruising fight over his nomination, as several women accused him of sexual misconduct during his high school and college years.The allegations saturated national news for several weeks, upending the confirmation process and drawing hundreds of protesters to Capitol Hill, where they confronted senators, engaged in demonstrations and disrupted hearings.On Sept. 25, after protesters heckled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his wife at a restaurant near the Capitol, Republicans began to describe them as a \u201cmob\u201d of embittered Democrats bent on destroying an innocent Kavanaugh.The rhetoric shifted to the campaign after Kavanaugh was confirmed Oct. 6.That night in Topeka, Kan., Trump said that Democrats had turned into an \u201cangry mob\u201d and that their treatment of Kavanaugh and his family was \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\u201cEach of you will have a chance in just four weeks to render your verdict on the Democrats\u2019 conduct at the ballot box,\u201d he said.Trump has extolled Kavanaugh at events for GOP candidates in Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.Graham has seized on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation battle as he crisscrosses the country for GOP Senate candidates such as incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (Nev.), Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.).\u201cWho do you want to run your government?\u201d Graham said Sunday at an event for Blackburn in Nashville. \u201cYou want the people that are going to destroy this man to be in charge? They wanted power so badly that there\u2019s nothing they wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe issue has also come up in Senate debates in North Dakota, Minnesota, Arizona and Missouri, where Attorney General Josh Hawley portrayed Sen. Claire McCaskill as one of the Democrats who had \u201claid in wait to try to ruin [Kavanaugh] and his family.\u201d\u201cWhen you see these mobs popping up in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings, the screaming, the shouting, driving people out of restaurants and confronting them, this is terrible. This is not the United States of America,\u201d Hawley said at a debate last week.McCaskill voted against Kavanaugh, but she is not a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that held hearings on his nomination. She said that she \u201cdid not participate in the chaos around the Kavanaugh confirmation.\u201dPolitics was at issue from the beginning of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, when Democrats raised concerns about the nominee\u2019s fitness for the high court given his work as a staffer for Kenneth Starr, who led a lengthy investigation into President Bill Clinton, and the George W. Bush White House.Kavanaugh also raised eyebrows when he said during a widely viewed congressional hearing on Sept. 27 that the women\u2019s sexual assault allegations were an \u201corchestrated political hit\u201d fueled by \u201cpent-up anger about President Trump\u201d and a desire for \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons.\u201dThe next week, as former justice John Paul Stevens described Kavanaugh\u2019s comments as disqualifying, he sought to repair the damage in an op-ed titled, \u201cI Am an Independent, Impartial Judge.\u201d\u201cYes, I was emotional last Thursday. I hope everyone can understand I was there as a son, husband and dad,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in the Wall Street Journal.A Washington Post-ABC News poll from this month suggested that Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation has eroded confidence in the nonpartisanship of the high court, as 43\u00a0percent of Americans believe the court\u2019s rulings will be more politically motivated now that Kavanaugh is a member.Both conservative and liberal justices have tried to assuage such fears, pointing out how often the court votes unanimously and stressing their nonpartisan and congenial relations.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. directly confronted the issue during a speech this month, telling an audience at the University of Minnesota that he wanted to \u201cassure\u201d them that the court serves \u201cone nation\u201d and not \u201cone party or one interest.\u201d Roberts also made a point of noting that he was paraphrasing Kavanaugh.But that image of independence is undermined by some of Trump\u2019s comments, some experts said. Trump, more than any presidential candidate in recent history, made the Supreme Court an election issue and has celebrated his nominees\u2019 contribution to a fortified conservative court.\u201cRemember, this is part and parcel of what the president promised to deliver,\u201d said Dennis Hutchinson, a law professor and court scholar at the University of Chicago.Recent comments from other top Republicans have also cast the court in a political light.Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said this month that Republicans would \u201csee whether or not the Kavanaugh fight was worth it\u201d if Democrats win the House and subpoena Trump\u2019s tax returns. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled that he would help fill a high-court vacancy if one emerges in 2020, despite blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 nominee on the argument that it was a presidential election year.At a celebration at the White House just after his confirmation, Kavanaugh stressed that he would be nonpartisan. But Hutchinson said he felt that Kavanaugh undermined his point with his effusive praise of the Republican senators and one Democrat who supported him.\u201cI thank the members of the United States Senate: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his leadership and steady resolve. I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley for his wisdom and fairness. And I give special gratitude to Senators Rob Portman, Susan Collins, Joe Manchin, Jon Kyl, and Lindsey Graham. They\u2019re a credit to the country and the Senate,\u201d Kavanaugh said.\u201cI could not believe that and wondered how the eight [other members of the court] felt sitting there,\u201d Hutchinson said."}
