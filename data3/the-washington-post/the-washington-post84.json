{"id": "Boris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit\u00a0", "paragraph": " LONDON \u2014 A Brexit deal may be days, weeks or an eternity away, and it is tearing\u00a0everyone apart \u2014 the people, the parties, even Boris Johnson\u2019s family. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn,\u00a0told the Germans in an interview published Friday that \u201cwe can\u2019t stop\u201d Brexit. His top lieutenants immediately went on television to say Corbyn doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u00a0The Tories? They spent the weekend on the talk shows, trash-talking their prime minister, as factions threaten open revolt in Parliament this week.And the poor public? As hopelessly divided as ever, according to the hopelessly muddled opinion polls, which suggest that the people \u2014 who in 2016 narrowly voted in favor of Britain leaving the European Union \u2014 may have changed their minds and now support \u201cRegrexit.\u201dGet it?\u00a0Then there is the Johnson family.The blond brood of mop-headed Oxford University overachievers whose best-known member is the former London mayor and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson \u2014 and the man who brought Britain Brexit \u2014 has suddenly emerged as the country\u2019s symbol of tumult over its departure from the continental trading bloc.The Johnson clan is in full public churn \u2014 for and against Brexit, and one another.There is intrafamilial tweeting, people.Johnson wants a clean break from the E.U. No second thoughts. No compromise. When he quit Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet in July, he wailed that May was surrendering to Brussels in Brexit negotiations and that Britain was \u201cheaded for the status of a colony.\u201dYounger brother Jo Johnson was also part of May\u2019s cabinet, as transport minister, and he echoed some of Boris\u2019s sentiment when he resigned in a huff on Friday. May\u2019s plan for Brexit was simply too much of a shambolic compromise, he said. She was presenting Britain with a choice between \u201cvassalage\u201d to E.U. rules or the \u201cchaos\u201d of a no-deal Brexit \u2014 think food shortages and grounded aircraft.Except, unlike his brother, Jo Johnson voted to \u201cremain\u201d in the 2016 Brexit referendum. And what he wants next is a do-over. \u201cIt is imperative that we now go back to the people and check that they are content to proceed on this extraordinary basis,\u201d he said.The editorial board of the Financial Times, where Jo Johnson toiled as an editor and correspondent before running for public office, called him \u201cthe serious Mr. Johnson,\u201d as opposed to the bombastic Boris.The elder Johnson, for his part, cheered his brother on, saying that though the two disagree over Brexit, his sibling was right to take a hike.\u201cBoundless admiration as ever for my brother Jo,\u201d\u00a0Johnson posted on Twitter a few hours after the announcement. \u201cWe may not have agreed about Brexit but we are united in dismay at the intellectually and politically indefensible of the U.K. position,\u201d which he said \u201cdoes not remotely correspond to the mandate of the people.\u201dJo Johnson\u2019s exit from Brexit was also given props by his father, the author and former British politician Stanley Johnson, who shares the family\u2019s gift of understatement, declaring that May\u2019s Brexit plan was \u201ccareering into the jaws of death.\u201dStanley Johnson has experienced his own wrenching reversals over Brexit. After voting to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, he later announced that he had changed his mind.\u201cThe time has come\u00a0to bail out,\u201d Stanley Johnson decided in 2017. This even though the elder Johnson had had his bread long buttered in Brussels, serving as a Tory party member of the European Parliament and as head of European Commission\u2019s Environment Action Program.Will it ever end? Apparently, no.Rachel Johnson, a broadcaster and book author and sister of Boris and Jo,\u00a0was tweeting on Monday that \u201cthe problem with Brexit is Brexit.\u201d Rachel is a \u201cremainer.\u201d So much so that she left the familial perch in the Conservative Party for the Liberal Democrats in 2017 in opposition to Brexit.And then there\u2019s brother Leo Johnson, a broadcaster and megatrends expert. Leo would prefer to remain in the E.U., too. He also supports a second referendum, a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d that would allow citizens to tick \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on May\u2019s final deal \u2014 or no deal \u2014 with Brussels.On Friday,\u00a0Rachel retweeted Leo, who retweeted her after she retweeted their brother\u2019s resignation message on Twitter.This family feud has not escaped notice.\u201cWow,\u201d the\u00a0Guardian newspaper columnist John Crace tweeted. \u201cLooking like 4-1 in favour of second referendum in Johnson household with only one brother and the mother yet to declare.\u201dThat tweet, too, was retweeted by Rachel. \u201cMaybe way to settle this matter once and for all is to spare the country another one and simply have a referendum in the Johnson family then,\u201d she wrote.Read moreBrexit bankroller Arron Banks faces criminal probe over referendum campaign paymentsQueen Elizabeth breaks silence on Brexit \u2014 in a very queenlike wayTheresa May just warned of a \u2018no-deal Brexit.\u2019 Here are some of the doomsday scenarios.Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the worldLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}
