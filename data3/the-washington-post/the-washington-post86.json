{"id": "Thank you, Stan Lee, for She-Hulk, a superhero who is beautiful when she\u2019s angry", "paragraph": " Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  Everyone who loves superhero storytelling has a Stan Lee moment.\u00a0\u201c\u2018With great power comes great responsibility\u2019 is one of the greatest single moral injunctions in all of American pop culture,\u201d the comic book writer Greg Pak wrote of Spider-Man\u2019s motto. The critic Maureen Ryan recalled a personal kindness Lee showed her son. Dorkly editor Tristan Cooper\u00a0praised his sense of humor.As for me, the greatest debt I owe this giant of the comics industry, who died on Nov. 12 at 95, is She-Hulk, my favorite superheroine and a testament to the power of female anger.She-Hulk illustrates both Lee\u2019s commercial savvy and his creative instincts. The character was essentially a rights grab, created in an attempt to make sure that the Bionic Woman wouldn\u2019t become the go-to superpowered woman in the public imagination. Lee created Jennifer Walters as Bruce Banner\u2019s cousin, who acquired his propensity to get big and green \u2014 though not mindless \u2014 through an emergency blood transfusion.Lee didn\u2019t write the character for long. But one measure of his accomplishment in creating her is that she has been such a fertile template for other writers. She-Hulk is an enduring fantasy for reasons that have nothing to do with some male readers\u2019 (and creators\u2019) dreams of being dominated by powerful women. She-Hulk speaks to a world where women are compelling and alluring when we\u2019re at our most powerful, where our anger must be reckoned with and can\u2019t be an excuse to marginalize us.In the midst of a years-long conversation about sexual violence, female vulnerability and sexual freedom, Dan Slott\u2019s \u201cSingle Green Female\u201d She-Hulk stories are a blast of liberating fun. She-Hulk\u2019s romantic adventures let us imagine what it might be like to be a woman who could never be hurt or overpowered by a partner. Because her superpowers manifest in the form of physical transformation, she\u2019s harder to distort or reduce to a pinup, as some artists have done to superheroines whose powers are more intangible. She-Hulk is strong, and that strength is a source of pleasure to her as much as it is a reason for us to admire her.And at a time when the women confronting senators over Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court were alternately painted as aggressive or hysterical, I felt braced by scenes of She-Hulk\u2019s righteous anger. The panels where she confronts and outwits Iron Man, who assumes that, like her cousin, she becomes a mindless monster when she\u2019s transformed, make me hope for a day when the public can recognize the reason behind women\u2019s rage. She-Hulk doesn\u2019t lose herself when she transforms; she becomes a more concentrated version of herself.I suspect the reasons She-Hulk has been so resonant for me are also the major obstacles to a She-Hulk movie adaptation or a streaming show about her. She\u2019s not a tortured anti-heroine, nor is she a sex object who happens to punch really hard. Instead, she\u2019s a modern woman whose greatest power seems to be her ability to blast through the complications and contradictions that vex the rest of us.Read more:\u00a0Alyssa Rosenberg:\u00a0For a moment, the Red Sox World Series victory made the world make sense againAlyssa Rosenberg:\u00a0The \u2018good guy with a gun\u2019 is Hollywood\u2019s most dangerous lieWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites."}
