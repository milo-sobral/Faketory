{"id": "Trump\u2019s false claim on health care ignores years-long GOP effort to repeal Obamacare", "paragraph": "President Trump celebrated with House Republicans in the White House Rose Garden last year when they passed a bill to undo the Affordable Care Act and its protection for Americans with preexisting medical conditions.On Wednesday, less than two weeks before the midterm elections, Trump falsely claimed that ensuring coverage for those with asthma, diabetes, pregnancy and other conditions was a Republican priority, rather than a Democratic one.\u201cRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in a tweet.The misleading statement about the 2010 health care law, which passed with only Democratic votes, reflects a strategy that Republicans are hoping will pay off Nov. 6: Repeatedly tell voters that the GOP supports one of the ACA\u2019s most popular provisions and hope they ignore or forget eight years of votes, rhetoric, legal efforts and bureaucratic moves to gut the law.\u201cOverall, this is something that voters want to hear candidates talk about,\u201d Ashley Kirzinger, a senior survey analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said of protections for those with preexisting conditions. What casts uncertainty on the election, she said, is that voters \u201cmay not be making the connection that repealing the ACA would also mean an elimination of those protections.\u201dThe Republican messaging shift, which extends from the president to Senate and House candidates in competitive races across the country, comes amid a growing air of uncertainty surrounding next month\u2019s election.Several factors have been moving in Republicans\u2019 favor in recent weeks, including Trump\u2019s rising approval rating and a party base newly energized by the battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.Yet health care remains the Republican Party\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, and GOP candidates such as Arizona Senate nominee Rep. Martha McSally have found themselves facing tough questions about how they reconcile their current support for coverage for preexisting conditions with their longtime efforts to repeal the health-care law.McSally, who is facing Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in one of the country\u2019s most closely watched Senate races, is drawing attention with a new ad in which she claims that she is \u201cleading the fight to .\u2009.\u2009. force insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions\u201d \u2014 even though she not only voted for legislation that would have weakened such protections but rallied other House Republicans.McSally was peppered with questions from reporters in Arizona after a campaign event Wednesday afternoon.\u201cIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. Stop parroting Democrat talking points,\u201d McSally told a journalist who challenged her over previous health-care votes, according to video of one heated exchange posted by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. \u201cHealth care is a complex issue.\u201dOther Republicans in tight races, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Dean Heller (Nev.), are delivering a similar message. On Wednesday afternoon, Walker tweeted a link to a campaign ad in which he tells viewers that his wife has diabetes, his brother has a heart condition and his mother is a cancer survivor.\u201cPre-existing conditions are personal to me,\u201d Walker said in the tweet, pledging that those conditions \u201calways will be\u201d covered as long as he is governor.In fact, Wisconsin is one of the 20 states that has filed a lawsuit arguing the ACA with its protections for preexisting conditions is unconstitutional, a legal fight that the Trump administration has backed.Democrats \u2014 who have long pummeled their opponents with ads on the issue \u2014 are responding with fury to the latest Republican effort, and several on Wednesday accused the president of gaslighting voters.\u201cGood morning, America,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) fired back at Trump in a tweet, saying simply, \u201cThis is a lie.\u201dGood morning, America. This is a lie. https://t.co/JXD8RzxJ1YA Washington Post-ABC News poll earlier this month found that Democrats have a 16-percentage-point advantage among registered voters on the question of who they trust to handle health care overall. Eighty-two percent of respondents cited health care as either \u201cone of the single most important issues\u201d or \u201ca very important issue\u201d in their vote for Congress this year.And a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that Democrats are trusted over Republicans by more than 2-to-1 to continue preexisting condition protections.Yet complicating matters for Republicans is that a substantial portion of their party base continues to support a repeal of the ACA.According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of voters in Florida and Nevada, a plurality of registered Republicans in each of the two battleground states cites repeal of the law as the most important health-care issue in determining their vote for Congress. Second on the list: protecting preexisting conditions.A recent analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project found that between Sept. 18 and Oct. 15, nearly 55\u00a0percent of TV ads supporting Democratic candidates focused on health care \u2014 a messaging offensive that Kirzinger said is indicative of Democrats\u2019 newfound confidence on the issue.\u201cIn previous cycles, most Democratic candidates didn\u2019t want to talk about health care. It wasn\u2019t seen as a winning issue,\u201d she said.The Republican Party\u2019s messages on the issue have been decidedly mixed.In a tweet last week, Trump wrote that \u201c[a]ll Republicans support people with pre-existing conditions, and if they don\u2019t, they will after I speak to them.\u201d\u201cI am in total support,\u201d he added. \u201cAlso, Democrats will destroy your Medicare, and I will keep it healthy and well!\u201dYet Trump has repeatedly promised to repeal the law, known as Obamacare, and bemoaned the failure of a Republican-led effort to do so last year. As recently as last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he wants to take another shot at repealing the health-care law after the midterm elections.\u201cIf we had the votes to completely start over, we\u2019d do it,\u201d McConnell said in an interview with Reuters, calling his party\u2019s failure to repeal the law \u201cthe one disappointment of this Congress from a Republican point of view.\u201dMeanwhile, under a Trump administration rule finalized in August, insurers are permitted to sell short-term health insurance plans that do not have to cover preexisting conditions and certain kinds of health care that the ACA requires.Senate Democrats fell one vote short in a bid this month to overturn the rule, deriding the less expensive policies as \u201cjunk\u201d plans.With polls showing that large majorities of Americans favor keeping protections for those with preexisting conditions intact, Republican candidates have increasingly sought to assure voters that they support those protections despite a years-long GOP effort to repeal the 2010 law, a partial 16-day government shutdown in 2013 to try to defund it and dozens of House votes to revamp or scrap the law.Republican strategist Michael Steel, who was previously an adviser to former House speaker John A. Boehner, said that Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) decisive thumbs-down vote on repealing the ACA last year \u201csignaled the end of that war and the beginning of a new fight.\u201dIn the current battle, he said, Republican candidates should not only focus on critiquing the \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan promoted by some progressives but also continue to \u201cmake it absolutely clear\u201d that they support protections for preexisting conditions.\u201cThat\u2019s the reason Republicans have always said \u2018repeal and replace,\u2019 not just \u2018repeal,\u2019\u2009\u201d Steel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always about figuring out which portions of the ACA make sense.\u201d Scott Clement contributed to this report.
