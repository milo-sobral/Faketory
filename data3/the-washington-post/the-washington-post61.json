PITTSBURGH \u2014 Mayor Bill Peduto had told his team not to call on Saturday morning unless it was urgent. He was planning to sleep in, a rarity, which meant certain protocols applied, including that he would answer his phone only if it rang twice. When the first call came around 10\u00a0a.m., Peduto was \u00adcocooned under his blanket and chose to ignore it. When the second call came moments later, the conversation with his chief of staff, Dan Gilman, was swift and matter-of-fact: \u201cThere\u2019s been a shooting at Tree of Life, there are multiple people shot, including police.\u201d \u201cCan you pick me up?\u201d Peduto asked. Gilman replied, \u201cI\u2019m already on my way.\u201dFive blocks from his home, the deadliest attack on Jews in the United States was still unfolding. Rain was pouring down on his city. His public safety director was out of town. His constituents, people he knew well \u2014 including some inside the synagogue \u2014 were about to begin an all-too-common brand of American suffering. As he stood under a tree shielding himself, hoping to stay dry, chaos built around him.He tried to stay calm for himself, for Pittsburgh.\u201cThere\u2019s SWAT teams running past us in full body armor, police sirens going off in every direction, cars flying to get there, firefighters already blocking down the streets,\u201d Peduto recalled.He began thinking about evil and how this wasn\u2019t just mass murder, but mass murder of the elderly: Nine of the victims were 65 or older.\u201cIt was mass murder that preyed on the elderly for the way they pray at that place they call sanctuary .\u2009.\u2009. in what should be the most secure place that they have in their life,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cAnd it took what we were dealing with to a whole different level of evil.\u201dBefore the true toll of that evil was known, before bomb squads had secured the building, before the heart-wrenching condolence calls, before the crying, before the string of funerals, before his city was forced into a near-constant state of mourning, Peduto\u2019s phone rang again.It was President Trump.The three-minute phone call with the president jarred Peduto, 54, the popular second-term Democratic mayor of the Steel City, just as he was trying to get his head around what was happening. After offering thoughts and prayers \u2014 and pledging anything Peduto needed, including a direct line to the White House \u2014 Trump veered directly into policy, Peduto recalled. The president, Peduto said, insisted on discussing harsher death penalty legislation as a way to prevent such atrocities. Peduto was stunned into silence.\u201cI\u2019m literally standing two blocks from 11 bodies right now. Really?\u201d Peduto said, noting that he was numb and believed that talking about the death penalty wasn\u2019t \u201cgoing to bring them back or deter what had just happened. .\u2009.\u2009. I ended the conversation pretty quickly after that.\u201dWhite House spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment about Trump\u2019s call to Peduto. The president said after the shooting that armed guards might have been able to stop the shooter and prevent the massacre, and he said at a campaign rally hours after the shooting that \u201cwe have to bring back the death penalty\u201d for those who kill innocent people. (Pennsylvania last executed an inmate in 1999, and in 2015 Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced a suspension of the death penalty.)The call between Trump and Peduto portended what would become one of the most challenging weeks a mayor can envision, in which Peduto was thrust into a national policy debate and ultimately a string of public clashes with the president \u2014 including urging Trump to stay away from the city until the community could bury its dead. Against Peduto\u2019s wishes, Trump spent a few hours in Pittsburgh on Oct. 30 amid a week of funerals to share his condolences. The visit drew peaceful public protests and Peduto\u2019s ire.\u201cIt could have been avoided,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cHe could have chosen to go to the Holocaust museum and lay a wreath with his wife. Or put together a fund in order to memorialize the 11 people whose lives were lost for perpetuity, in the museum.\u201dTree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who welcomed Trump\u2019s visit, said in a televised interview that he found the president to be \u201cvery warm, very consoling\u201d and was \u201cpleasantly surprised by a warm and personal side to the president that I don\u2019t think America has ever seen.\u201dWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Wednesday that Trump found the afternoon in Pittsburgh to be \u201cvery humbling\u201d and \u201cvery sad.\u201dPeduto said Trump\u2019s visit angered him not just because it flouted the wishes of families who asked him not to be there but because it stretched the city\u2019s police, forcing him to break one of his first promises to the Jewish community after the attack: that they would have all the security they needed at their schools and houses of worship.\u201cI was at three Jewish schools and I talked to kids as young as first grade, and I had at least three or four police officers with me to introduce themselves, and our goal was very simple: \u2018You\u2019re going to see police officers outside your school this next week. We want you to know that they\u2019re here to protect you,\u2019 \u201d Peduto said on the day of Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to have officers at those three schools, and if we do, we\u2019ll have one.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first time Peduto had taken on Trump. Last year, after the United States pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, Peduto pushed back against the president\u2019s assertion that he \u201cwas elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201d\u201cAs the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris agreement for our people, our economy & future,\u201d Peduto tweeted in response.[Pittsburgh mayor says armed guards are not the solution after shooting]While Peduto was on a national stage for the past week, his attention has been on Pittsburgh. Peduto knows that Pittsburgh City Hall isn\u2019t necessarily the best position for taking on gun control or to combat hate speech across the land. Would he seek higher office when his term ends in 2021?\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, maybe even the opposite. I love my job. .\u2009.\u2009. This is the only political job other than being a council member that I have sought or that I will seek. I want to work for the city of Pittsburgh. I love my city.\u201dIn a series of interviews during the past week as he tended to his grieving city, Peduto said he was trying his hardest to be the leader the Jewish community here needed. Genial, in tortoiseshell glasses and a bushy white beard, Peduto also acknowledges he became an unlikely face of the Trump resistance days before the midterms. While the president spoke about armed guards at places of worship and the death penalty as a deterrent, Peduto spoke about access to firearms and railed against the toxic political discourse and apparent anti-Semitism behind the synagogue attack.But he said he wanted to steer everyone\u2019s focus to the people of Pittsburgh, to a path toward healing.\u201cThe advice I got from Libby Schaaf, the mayor of [Oakland, Calif.] who went through a similar tragedy, was have a plan and make it clear and concise and make it transparent,\u201d he said last week. \u201cI\u2019ve been very, very clear since Saturday night that our mission this week is to first and foremost help the families of the victims to get through this week, to get through the funeral process for each and every one of them and focus on their needs.\u201dThose needs have weighed heavily on Peduto, an Italian Catholic mayor who prides himself as an \u201cadopted\u201d member of the Jewish community here. He was the first non-Jewish council member to represent the 8th District, which includes the synagogue\u2019s neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, since the 1980s, and he is a resident of the area, living less than a mile from Tree of Life.\u201cThis is where I chose to live,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cI would consider some of the folks to be some of my longest friends, and I\u2019ve had those friendships for 25 years .\u2009.\u2009. well prior to ever running for office.\u201dPeduto, like many in Squirrel Hill, has many personal connections to the victims and families affected by the massacre. That meant he was forced to play rabbi to some of his own friends, notifying them that their loved ones could be among the dead. One such person was Michele Rosenthal, who knew her two brothers had been at the synagogue, but on the morning of the attack wasn\u2019t sure whether David and Cecil had made it out alive.\u201cShe came up and she was trying to find out about both her brothers,\u201d Peduto said with a sigh, his eyes fixed on the floor of his City Hall office. At that point, he had heard secondhand that one brother was dead, but he wasn\u2019t sure, and he didn\u2019t want to pass on a rumor. \u201cSo I hugged her and told her any information we have, she\u2019s going to have.\u201dIn the minutes after that conversation, he quietly walked up to Rosenthal\u2019s husband, a former colleague and Pittsburgh public safety official, and told him to prepare for the worst. Both David and Cecil, it turned out, had been killed.The personal and professional blurred for Peduto during the past week, as he wrestled with how to shepherd the Jewish community and the city through its darkest episode \u2014 and how to get himself through it emotionally. In the first two days after the attack, he slept for three hours and ate little more than a plate of cold pizza and green beans served by his neighbors as he drifted through a haze of funerals, family visitations and public events.He said that one of the most difficult moments was waking up and feeling unsafe in his own home.\u201cI was in my house, and I was scared. I had this fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very strong sense of insecurity. I didn\u2019t know if this was the first domino to fall. I didn\u2019t know.\u201dAnother trying moment was when that fear gave way to solitude: Peduto, who is single and lives alone, compared his need to be around people with how some traumatized New Yorkers felt after 9/11. \u201cI could have gone home and just taken a few minutes to do my laundry or to take two hours to rest, but I couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d he said shortly after the funeral of the Rosenthal brothers. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t sit in my house by myself.\u201dSo he tried to be everywhere and with everyone. As he went from funeral to funeral to funeral, he arrived early at a synagogue to spend time with mourners, holding their hands, avuncularly hugging them and giving words of comfort.\u201cAnybody who I know is a member of the Jewish community, I reach out and grab their hands and I\u2019ll look them in the eye and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 There is deep sorrow,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take to dissipate.\u201dPeduto speaks with zeal about the role Pittsburghers have played in helping the city through these moments. When he visited Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a local coffeehouse and bar where his presence is well-known, everyone gave him a hug.\u201cAnd then, as people were passing by the window, they would just reach out and put their hand on the window. And I got back to my house. I was in a completely different place,\u201d he said. \u201cI have this peace of mind and inner peace right now that is helping me to get that message out.\u201dHe also said God had been helping him find that peace. He read off his phone a text that he sent his brother Guy shortly after the attack: \u201cI know it sounds weird but I believe that there is a greater voice that is speaking through me. I can\u2019t explain this. And you know how skeptical I am.\u201d His brother texted in response: \u201cDefinitely the divine voice has been guiding you God and Dave are with you. I believe it.\u201dDave is a reference to Peduto\u2019s beloved older brother, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack two years ago, at age 62. His death has never stopped feeling raw, but Peduto said his presence provided comfort during the past week, as if David were speaking through him.\u201cI was raised to be religious and I have stayed spiritual,\u201d Peduto said, before joking: \u201cThe bishop may say I better get to church soon.\u201dAbove all it was Peduto\u2019s clashes with Trump that helped focus his mind last week, he said, crystallizing his commitment to the families affected by the massacre.\u201cSomebody asked me, \u2018If you had the choice to do it over again, would you have been with the president?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cMy answer was, if I had the chance to do it a hundred times, a hundred times I would have been with the families and with my officers.\u201dNor is he afraid to link the president\u2019s rhetoric to the attack itself.\u201cThis obviously was somebody whose decision to kill Jewish people was based on what he was reading, with news of migrants who are trying to escape the hell they are in and potentially on their way to the United States. And somehow that story has become butchered into a story of an invading army and then that story being manipulated that it\u2019s the Jews that are doing it and they\u2019re financing it,\u201d Peduto said. \u201cThen this guy wakes up on a Saturday morning armed to the gills with bullets and guns to kill as many Jewish people as he possibly can.\u201dPeduto said he knows nothing at all about the suspect\u2019s past or the immediate circumstances that led to the attack \u2014 noting only that the man appeared to be sufficiently sophisticated to have covered up his tracks online.\u201cHe knew what he was doing. He was pretty savvy with software. He knew ways to hide information,\u201d Peduto said. Asked whether that implied the suspect had long been plotting an attack, he said: \u201cYeah \u2014 or very paranoid that what he was doing would one day lead to it.\u201dPerhaps the most difficult day for Peduto, following the initial shock of the massacre, was Tuesday, the day of Trump\u2019s visit, in part because it was Peduto\u2019s 54th birthday. On little sleep and in crisis mode, Peduto said his mother forced him to stop by for a late-night piece of cake with her and his siblings.For him, the sweet moment amid the suffering was symbolic of the next phase of the city\u2019s recovery \u2014 a process he says will be an \u201carc\u201d and a \u201cmarathon.\u201d Peduto is fully aware that life will not quickly return to normal for Pittsburgh.\u201cIt is going to be a long haul, and this doesn\u2019t just go away. It stays there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will forever change your city.\u201d Sign up for email updates from the \"Confronting the Caliphate\" series.
