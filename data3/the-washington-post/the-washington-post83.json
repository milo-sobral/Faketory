{"id": "Buccaneers sticking with Fitzpatrick as starting QB", "paragraph": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are sticking with Ryan Fitzpatrick as their No. 1 quarterback.Coach Dirk Koetter said Monday that the 14th-year pro, who failed to produce a touchdown in the previous day\u2019s 16-3 loss to Washington, will start next Sunday on the road against the New York Giants.The Bucs (3-6) have dropped six of seven games following a 2-0 start, with Fitzpatrick starting four of the losses after leading the team to surprising victories over New Orleans and Philadelphia while Jameis Winston was serving a suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go with Fitz this week,\u201d Koetter said, adding he still feels Fitzpatrick \u201cgives us the best opportunity\u201d to win and pull out of a tailspin that\u2019s jeopardized the prospects of ending a long playoff drought.Also, struggling kicker Chandler Catanzaro was waived.Catanzaro was one for three on field goals against the Redskins, missing from 30 and 47 yards. In addition to being 11 of 15 through nine games, the fifth-year pro who signed as a free agent after spending last season with the New York Jets has missed four extra points.Winston, banned the first three games of the season for touching a female Uber driver inappropriately in 2016, regained his starting job for three games before being benched three weeks ago.Koetter left open the possibility of switching back to Winston after the Bucs gained 501 yards, but only scored three points against the Redskins. Fitzpatrick threw for 406 yards, but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble.Washington finished with four takeaways, while Tampa Bay failed to force a turnover for the sixth consecutive game.\u201cTurnovers are killing us right now. We\u2019re minus-19 (in turnover differential), last in the league,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cThirteen turnovers and no takeaways in the last four games. That\u2019s by far the No. 1 thing that\u2019s hurting our team.\u201dWinston hasn\u2019t played since throwing four interceptions during the first three quarters of a road loss at Cincinnati on Oct. 28. The fourth-year player has thrown 10 picks and lost one fumble in four games since returning from his suspension.Koetter remains optimistic that the Bucs, who haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2007, can turn themselves around.Winston, the first overall pick from the 2015 draft, is due to earn $20.9 million next year in the final season of the contract he signed as a rookie.Koetter said he understands the thinking that the Bucs need to find out exactly what they have in the fourth-year pro.Nevertheless, he\u2019s sticking with Fitzpatrick for now.\u201cWe\u2019re barely past the halfway point in the season. There\u2019s a lot of football to be played. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm of possibility that we can turn this thing and get on a little bit of a win streak,\u201d Koetter said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better football more consistently across the board,\u201d the coach added. \u201cOur defense took a nice step in that direction (Sunday). I still think when we put it together on both sides of the ball we\u2019ll be all right.\u201dFitzpatrick, 2-4 as the starter this season, has 2,199 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He\u2019s turned the ball over five times the past two weeks during losses to Carolina and Washington.After Sunday\u2019s game, the 35-year-old shrugged off a question about whether he felt he had done enough to retain the starting job.\u201cI love playing football. That\u2019s not something I concern myself with or care about,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, who\u2019s played for seven teams over 14 seasons. \u201cIf I get a chance to go out there, I try to do my best and play as hard as I can and enjoy myself.\u201d___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
