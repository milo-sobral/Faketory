{"id": "Michael Bloomberg to air $5 million in ads before midterm elections to tout Democrats \u2014 and himself", "paragraph": "Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is considering a 2020 presidential campaign, took another step closer to that possibility Sunday with a $5\u2009million national advertising effort that encourages voters to support Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 and offers Bloomberg\u2019s centrist politics as a counter to President Trump.Bloomberg\u2019s two-minute television ad, which features him speaking directly to the camera and standing before an American flag, first aired Sunday during CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d It will air again Monday during the evening news programs on broadcast networks and on MSNBC and CNN.Bloomberg, 76, portrays himself in the spot as a steady and seasoned Washington outsider (hint: presidential) who is appalled by Trump\u2019s conduct and agenda and alarmed by episodes of political violence and Trump\u2019s mounting attacks on the caravan of Central American migrants.As soft piano notes play, Bloomberg criticizes the \u201cshouting and hysterics\u201d in Washington and the \u201cpointed fingers\u201d and \u201cfearmongering\u201d by Trump on immigration.A grainy image of Trump flashes for a moment \u2014 a quick nod to the man he might challenge.\u201cAmericans are neither naive nor heartless,\u201d Bloomberg says. \u201cWe know that we can be a nation of immigrants while also securing our borders.\u201dBloomberg\u2019s top political advisers said he firmly believes there is enormous space in the political center and wants Democrats to court voters there and those on the right whose ties to Trump could be fraying. That runs counter to the positioning of many of his potential competitors for a Democratic nomination, who have moved sharply left in recent years.\u201cWhen you have the president threatening to shoot migrants at the border, that doesn\u2019t represent the center of the country or most of the GOP,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important to him to talk to those Americans.\u201dThe ad, paid for by Independence USA PAC, a political action committee funded by Bloomberg, will air during broadcasts the president regularly views.In a statement to The Washington Post on Sunday, Bloomberg said, \u201cThe country is deeply divided. The president and Republicans are fueling that division, and that holds us back as a nation. I\u2019m unwilling to sit by and accept it.\u201dWhile formally a pitch for Democrats \u2014 to whom Bloomberg has given more than $110 million this election cycle \u2014 the ad is also revealing of the kind of presentation he could bring to the 2020 campaign trail. He speaks flatly with the faded Boston accent from his youth, devoid of partisan passion and with a technocratic emphasis on competence.Beyond immigration, Bloomberg makes a broader case in the ad for political centrism in a time of national acrimony and political turmoil, and references the alleged anti-Semitic rampage by a gunman last month at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 people dead. Such an act \u201ctears at the heart\u201d of democracy and humanity, he says.Bloomberg supplies few solutions, however, beyond asserting that \u201ccalm reasoning\u201d should be applied to difficult national issues.The former mayor \u2014 who has been a Republican, independent and Democrat in his political career \u2014 also touched on other themes likely to surface if he runs for president: staunch support for gun control, a focus on climate change, and frustration with dysfunction in Congress and the rising federal deficit.Bloomberg has been traveling to wealthy and highly educated suburban areas outside of Philadelphia and other cities to speak to Democratic audiences. It has been, in part, a charm offensive to Democrats skeptical of him and a political past that has been at times out of step with the party\u2019s base, from his defense of stop-and-frisk policing that civil rights groups denounce as racist to his tangles with labor unions over pensions.Bloomberg\u2019s $110 million in political spending, dispersed to candidates and committees and related groups, has targeted expensive suburban House races in places such as California and Illinois, while also giving millions to the Democratic campaign to take back control of the U.S. Senate.The former mayor told The Post in an interview last month that a Bloomberg presidential campaign would not run within the Democratic Party as it exists, exactly. Were it to happen, his campaign would effectively be a bid to reshape the party, and he argued that there is a recent precedent for electoral success by a billionaire who starts a campaign distant from his party\u2019s precepts.\u201cNo one ever thought Trump could win, either,\u201d Bloomberg said.
