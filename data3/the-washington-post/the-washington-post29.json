{"id": "Erdogan stood up for Khashoggi \u2014 while Turkey jails more journalists than any other country", "paragraph": " ISTANBUL \u2014 His career spans four decades, and Can Dundar said he has never seen a darker period for journalism in Turkey. His colleagues have been imprisoned, banned from traveling, accused of inciting hatred and aiding terrorists. Major Turkish media outlets, the ones that still exist, toe the government line. Dundar himself now lives in exile in Berlin, publishing columns \u2014 in a series called \u201cMy Turkey\u201d \u2014 critical of a government that will likely jail him if he returns home.\u201cThey\u2019d take me right off the plane,\u201d said Dundar, the former editor-in-chief of a prominent Turkish daily who is accused of espionage and revealing state secrets.This week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pressed to fully investigate the killing of a high-profile Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, at Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.But journalists like Dundar and press advocates say that Erdogan\u2019s demands for truth and openness in the case belie the strategy he has used \u2014 ruthlessly and effectively \u2014 in one of the world\u2019s most sweeping crackdowns on press freedom. Some Erdogan critics note pointedly that Khashoggi, a former royal court insider turned Saudi government critic, fled his own country because of constraints on freedom of speech and diminished tolerance for dissent.\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Dundar said. \u201cIf [Erdogan] cares about journalists, what about ours\u201d in Turkey?Though journalists in Turkey have long faced risks, they say Erdogan\u2019s tactics in recent years have all but eliminated coverage that the government might dislike while pushing the country closer toward authoritarian rule. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey jails more journalists than any other nation \u2014 more than China, Russia and Egypt combined. Earlier this year, a Turkish court sentenced six journalists and media employees to life in prison for alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric and Erdogan rival Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara has said spearheaded a 2016 coup attempt.But even for journalists who don\u2019t face legal jeopardy, there are new hazards. After the thwarted coup, more than 100 broadcasters and other news outlets were ordered closed by a state decree, part of a massive purge of perceived Erdogan enemies. Other outlets have been converted into government cheerleaders after sales to pro-Erdogan businessmen or companies. Media members say they have had to weigh moral decisions about whether to remain in an industry that now serves as part of what one veteran journalist called the \u201cpropaganda machinery.\u201d\u201cJournalism is in a deep coma in Turkey,\u201d that journalist said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was reluctant to admit publicly that he was censoring himself. \u201cThere are taboos. I can\u2019t write anything. It\u2019s like the Twilight Zone.\u201dIn the World Press Freedom Index, published by Reporters Without Borders, Turkey ranks 157 among 180 nations.At a Bloomberg-organized forum last year, Erdogan responded to a question about imprisoned press members by saying, \u201cMost of those you say are in prison aren\u2019t journalists. Most of them are terrorists.\u201d He added: \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m a journalist\u2019 doesn\u2019t make you a journalist.\u201dFor Erdogan, the media controls are one way to rein in a highly polarized country and head off additional crises. The coup attempt involved a bombing of the parliament building, left more than 200 dead, and highlighted the Gulen movement\u2019s penetration of the military and state institutions. But Erdogan seized on the crisis to silence political opponents, as well. They were swept up in the post-coup purges and arrests, along with dissidents, journalists and innocent bystanders, human rights groups said.Specifically in his handling of the Khashoggi case, Erdogan has seized on a chance to present himself as a truth-teller, weaken the rival Saudis and burnish Turkey\u2019s international reputation, analysts say. Erdogan was said to have a personal relationship with Khashoggi, and they share some views about the place of Islam in politics. Speaking Tuesday, Erdogan described Khashoggi\u2019s killing not as an attack against journalism but as a brazen crime committed within a diplomatic building \u2014 involving an attempted Saudi cover-up that should \u201churt the conscience of all humanity.\u201dAuthorities here have said that many Turkish media members who were charged or sentenced shouldn\u2019t be considered journalists because they were engaged in activities beyond the scope of their profession. But journalists who\u2019ve faced legal trouble say the evidence used against them tends to be the basic daily work of journalism: articles, messages exchanged with sources, even affiliation with a particular outlet.In one prominent case, police acting on a court ruling in 2016 seized the offices of Turkey\u2019s highest-circulation newspaper, Zaman, firing tear gas at protesters and placing the paper under state control. Zaman, which had been affiliated with the Gulenist movement, soon was shut down for good. This July, six of its former columnists and editors were sentenced to prison terms. Amnesty International called the convictions \u201cabsurd.\u201dDescribing Turkey\u2019s media landscape, Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey specialist at St. Lawrence University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Project on Middle East Democracy, said that on major issues \u201cthe [TV] channels are in lockstep.\u201d\u201cThis would be the equivalent of being in a country in which you had seven MSNBCs or seven Fox televisions, where you had news that was clearly supportive of the government on all the channels,\u201d Eissenstat said.The media crackdown has also had personal implications for journalists, including for Dundar, who until three years ago held one of the top jobs in Turkish journalism, as editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet, a mainstream opposition newspaper. Dundar called the paper \u201cone of the last free castles of the free media,\u201d and in 2015, it published video and photos purporting to show weapons shipments from Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency to Syrian rebels. Erdogan said soon after that Dundar would pay a \u201cheavy price.\u201d Months later, he was arrested, along with the paper\u2019s Ankara bureau chief.Dundar has since lived in legal limbo. He spent three months in pretrial detention. He won his temporary release. He escaped injury when shot at by an assailant who called him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d (The assailant was arrested.) And in May 2016, he was sentenced to nearly six years in prison. He remained free to travel abroad while appealing that decision, and at the time of the coup, he was in Barcelona and working on a book. His lawyer suggested he not return, saying the courts couldn\u2019t be trusted to hear his case. Dundar listened. Instead, he went to Germany.\u201cI had luggage full of books and summer clothes and nothing else,\u201d he said.He has tried to lead a low-profile life in Berlin. He says he is lonely. His wife has been barred from leaving Turkey. He takes precautions about his safety. Earlier this year, Turkey\u2019s highest court said Dundar should in fact get a stiffer sentence \u2014 up to 20 years on espionage charges. At a news conference in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel last month, Erdogan called Dundar a \u201cspy\u201d who had revealed \u201cstate secrets\u201d and made a case for his extradition.Dundar started an online news portal that was swiftly blocked in Turkey. In the meantime, he contributes columns for the Germany weekly Die Zeit, and he writes about many of the topics that journalists in Turkey can\u2019t pursue, including corruption and press freedom. At times, he said, he feels more like an activist than a journalist.\u201cA freedom fighter, unfortunately,\u201d Dundar said. \u201cI say \u2018unfortunately\u2019 because it\u2019s not the kind of journalism I wanted.
