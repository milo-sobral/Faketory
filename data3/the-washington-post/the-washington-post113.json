{"id": "Yelling \u2018Heil Trump!\u2019 during \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 seemed like a good idea while drunk, man says", "paragraph": "A man who caused panic at a Baltimore theater by shouting \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d and \u201cHeil Trump!\u201d during a showing of \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d has apologized, explaining that the outburst was his ill-conceived attempt to protest President Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\u201cI was trying to compare Trump to Hitler because he plays into the fears of the people, and, and, and it just came out wrong,\u201d Anthony Derlunas II told WBAL-TV from his front porch, where several reporters tracked him down Friday \u2014 two days after police removed him from his balcony seat at the Hippodrome Theatre.\u201cI realize now that it was so hurtful in how it came out anti-Semitic,\u201d Derlunas said in a shaky voice. \u201cI have no hate in me.\u201dDerlunas told the Baltimore Sun he drank several glasses of wine before the musical, which tells the story of a Jewish family persecuted for their faith in imperial tsarist Russia and opened at the Hippodrome two weeks after a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\u201cThat didn\u2019t help my thinking one bit,\u201d Derlunas said.[\u2018They showed his photo, and my stomach just dropped\u2019: Neighbors recall synagogue massacre suspect as a loner]The 58-year-old said the first act\u2019s final scene \u2014 in which an anti-Semitic pogrom disrupts a Jewish wedding \u2014 reminded him of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, which call for mass deportations and a wall along the U.S. southern border.So during the intermission, with the wine still infusing his logic, Derlunas stood up from his seat in the balcony to make a performance of his own.\u201cI meant to put it in that light of a dictatorship and no compassion and mercy,\u201d he told WJZ.What happened instead became the subject of a brief police investigation and viral videos. Derlunas allegedly shouted, \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d and \u201cHeil Trump!\u201d and made a Nazi salute from his seat as people jumped from theirs and ran for the exits \u2014 some expecting another massacre to follow the shouts.\u201cThe next thing I expected to hear was gunshots, frankly,\u201d said Rich Scherr, who filmed the commotion from below as Derlunas\u2019s balcony neighbors appeared to confront him.Derlunas said he realized his error immediately. \u201cInstantly it was like, \u2018Oh my God, what did you do?' \u201d he told the Sun.Security personnel escorted him and his girlfriend out of the theater. At least one frightened patron had called 911, and an officer arrived at the lobby shortly before 10 p.m. to interview Derlunas.\u201cIt appeared to this officer based on my interview of Mr. Derlunas that his intention was to express his dislike of Donald Trump,\u201d the officer wrote in his report. He had no criminal history and so was released from the Hippodrome \u2014 with lifetime ban from returning.\"I would ban me too if I was in their position,\u201d Derlunas told the Sun on Friday, after the Anti-Defamation League demanded his prosecution for what the group called an \u201canti-Semitic outburst.\u201dIn his doorstep interviews, Derlunas tried to convince any skeptics that espousing bigotry has been the opposite of his intent.\u201cThe thing that I can\u2019t stand is Trump spreading hatred, and what did I do? I spread hatred,\u201d he told the Sun.\u201cI\u2019m torn apart, I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d he told WJZ. \u201cI\u2019m so disgusted and upset with myself for doing what I did.\u201dHe\u2019s been trying to make amends. Derlunas\u2019s listed phone number was not accepting incoming calls over the weekend. The Sun reported that he had phoned the theater and the Baltimore Jewish Council to apologize and was trying to reach local rabbis to do the same.Read more:A man shouted \u2018Heil Hitler\u2019 and \u2018Heil Trump\u2019 during \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 \u2014 and people fledA father who \u2018loves history\u2019 donned a Nazi uniform for Halloween \u2014 and dressed his 5-year-old as HitlerApparent Nazi salute at prom investigated by Wisconsin school district"}
