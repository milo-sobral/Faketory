{"id": "Class-action lawsuit accuses e-scooter companies of \u2018gross negligence\u2019", "paragraph": "The nation\u2019s electronic-scooter companies are facing more blowback as concerns rise about the safety of these devices \u2014 this time in the form of a class-action lawsuit filed Friday in California.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses two of the largest e-scooter companies, Lime and Bird, as well as other e-scooter firms, of \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201caiding and abetting assault.\u201dThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of eight initial plaintiffs, says the companies' practices have contributed to injuries in multiple ways. By \u201cdumping\u201d scooters on public streets without an appropriate warning, the suit alleges e-scooter companies acted negligently and should have known that their devices would become a dangerous \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201dThree plaintiffs claim they were walking when e-scooter riders crashed into them from behind, resulting in severe injuries. The suit alleges that e-scooter companies knew their riders were injuring pedestrians and \u2013\u2013 by failing to stop the collisions from occurring \u2013\u2013 assisted and encouraged scooter riders as they committed \u201cassaults.\u201dThe suit also states that both companies' scooters contain defective electronics and mechanical parts, as well inadequate safety instructions for riders and that they have \u201ca wanton disregard for the safety of others.\u201d The risks posed by the devices, the suit states, \u201cwere known and/or knowable\u201d based on \u201cprofessional knowledge\u201d known within the transportation community.The suit makes numerous claims about scooters' mechanical issues, but does not provide concrete evidence for those claims.The suit also names scooter manufacturers Xiaomi United States and Segway as defendants.\u201cWhile acting under the guise of the commendable goals of furthering personal freedom and mobility and protecting the environment, the Defendants, and each of them, are endangering the health, safety and welfare of riders, pedestrians and the general public,\u201d the suit states.The suit adds that \u201cscores (if not hundreds) of riders and pedestrians and members of the public have suffered, are continuing to suffer and will to continue to suffer egregious and avoidable injuries and damage to their person and property.\u201d[Scooter use is rising in major cities. So are trips to the emergency room.]Spokespersons for Segway and Xiaomi United States did not respond to a request for comment.A Lime spokesperson said the company is in the process of reviewing the complaint.\u201cWhile we don\u2019t comment on pending litigation, safety has always been at the very core of everything we do at Lime \u2013\u2013 as is our mission of reducing cars from city streets and making them safer and greener for pedestrians, bike and scooter riders alike,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the company \u201cprides itself on taking proactive steps relating safety wherever we have a presence.\"In a statement released by Bird, the company pointed out that the complaint has been brought \u201cagainst the entire e-scooter industry\" and said shared e-scooters have become an important transportation mode \u201cfor hundreds of thousands of people in 100 cities worldwide.\u201d\u201cWe believe that the climate crisis and our car dependency demand a transportation mode shift, and clean energy vehicles like e-scooters are already replacing millions of short car trips,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no evidence that riding an e-scooter presents a greater level of danger to riders than riding a bike. Cars remain the greatest threat to commuters, killing over 40,000 people in the US yearly.\u201dSince their sudden arrival in recent months, e-scooters have been linked to an uptick in severe injuries in hospitals around the country, according to emergency-room physicians. As the value and popularity of companies such as Bird and Lime have soared, a growing number of critics \u2013\u2013 including doctors, former riders and scooter mechanics \u2013\u2013 claim that e-scooter fleets are poorly maintained and prone to dangerous mechanical failures.Two e-scooter riders \u2013\u2013 one in Dallas and another in the District \u2013\u2013 have been involved in accidents that led to their deaths, authorities say.The class-action suit adds a new category of people to the list of those fiercely opposed to the latest form of controversial transportation sweeping the country: pedestrians.Among the plaintiffs is David Petersen, a 62-year-old street performer known as \u201cDavy Rocks,\u201d who alleges that he was severely injured after being struck by an e-scooter rider in June.Dancing for onlookers near the Santa Monica pier in California, Petersen, clad in his trademark \u201cgladiator outfit,\u201d told The Washington Post that he was hit from behind by a man on a Bird scooter; the man fled the scene. Petersen said the force of the collision knocked him down, but he managed to lessen the impact by catching himself with his right hand. Had he been an elderly person or a small child, he said, he could\u2019ve been killed.[Fatal e-scooter accident emerges just as California legalizes riding without a helmet]Petersen said he suffered a fractured arm and a severed biceps, an injury that caused him to miss weeks of work. The muscle had to be surgically reattached using a cadaver graft, he said.\u201cMy arm is never going to be the same, not to mention the five-inch-long scar it\u2019s got now,\u201d he said, noting that his arm has lost rotation and feels stiff. \u201cIf Bird is going to profit off the human meat grinder they\u2019ve created in Santa Monica, they should be held responsible for the suffering they\u2019ve caused.\u201dAdditionally, the lawsuit accuses Bird and Lime of multiple breaches of each company\u2019s warranty and alleges that their vehicles were \u201cnot suitable\u201d for repeated use in public places.Stating that the deployment of e-scooters is unlawful, the suit claims that each company should be prohibited from continuing to deploy scooters in California. Beyond seeking damages, the suit claims that scooter companies should be required to include \u201cadequate warnings and/or instructions\u201d to their apps and vehicles.Catherine Lerer \u2013\u2013 a personal-injury lawyer from Santa Monica who is representing the plaintiffs with lawyer Jeffrey Lee Costell \u2013\u2013 said she has received more than 100 calls from people injured by scooters in recent months. Whether they involve riders or pedestrians, she said, the injuries are consistent: broken noses, legs, arms, wrists, hands and ribs, as well as head injuries and tears to anterior cruciate ligaments and rotator cuffs that require surgery.\u201cWe filed this class-action lawsuit against Bird and Lime and the manufacturers of their electric scooters to address the terrible injuries they have inflicted on their riders and pedestrians, and the continuing harm they are causing,\u201d Lerer said."}
