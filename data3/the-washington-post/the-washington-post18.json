Lopez falls facedown on the ground, while Dunn moves to the right, partly obstructing the view of what happens next in the video.However, soon afterward, Lopez\u2019s body stops moving. As Dunn steps outside, a pool of blood can be seen forming beneath Lopez\u2019s body. On the ground, just to the upper right of Lopez\u2019s body, is a small hatchet.Dunn is being held at the Polk County Jail on no bond, officials said. He was taken into custody Friday from his attorney\u2019s office and was cooperative, Lakeland Police Chief Larry Giddens told reporters.Dunn\u2019s attorney, Rusty Franklin, did not immediately respond to a phone call and a message sent through his website requesting comment Saturday. However, Franklin previously told other local news outlets that Dunn was justified in shooting Lopez because Lopez was \u201cwielding an ax.\u201dOn Friday, Franklin told WTSP News that he would continue to \u201cvigorously assert Mr. Dunn\u2019s lawful right of self-defense.\u201d\"This situation was commenced and started not by Michael Dunn,\u201d Franklin told the news station. \u201cSomeone made a choice to shoplift.\u201dAccording to CNN, a probable cause affidavit stated that, as Lopez and Dunn struggled, the hatchet fell down Lopez\u2019s pant leg. Lopez reportedly offered to pay for the hatchet but then tried to flee the store, police said.\u201cAt no time did the victim appear to have made any threatening movements towards the suspect,\u201d the affidavit stated, according to CNN.Dunn\u2019s actions were not justified by Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground law, Brian Haas, the state attorney for the 10th Judicial Circuit of Florida, said at a news conference Friday.The law gained notoriety and national attention after an attorney for George Zimmerman considered using it to say his client was justified in shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., in 2012. Under the statute, a person is justified in using deadly force if he or she believes it is necessary to \u201cprevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been so much discussion on the facts of this case and the application of the stand-your-ground law,\u201d Haas said. \u201cI fully anticipate that those issues will be brought before a judge for a hearing. But let me be clear: It is the policy of my office to comply with and abide by the stand-your-ground law. However, I have determined that this case and the actions of Mr. Dunn fall outside the protections of the stand-your-ground law.\u201dHaas said Dunn\u2019s position as city commissioner had no bearing on his decision to take the case to a grand jury.\u201cWhat I can tell you is that the grand jury carefully considered the evidence that was presented to it, and they did their job, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go forward on,\u201d Haas said. \u201c[Dunn] was an owner of a store who, through this set of facts, this killing happened. It\u2019s not something that we see every day.\u201dAccording to his city bio, Dunn took office as a commissioner in January and represents Lakeland\u2019s southwest district. He served as chairman of the Lakeland Code Enforcement Board and graduated from the Lakeland Citizens' Police Academy.Police described Lopez as a transient, according to the Tampa Bay Times. His sister, Veronica Lopez, told the newspaper he was not a violent person.\u201cMy brother didn\u2019t need to be killed like some animal,\u201d she told the Times.Giddens, the police chief, defended the lengthy investigation of the case, saying the department submitted a complaint affidavit to the state attorney\u2019s office only nine days after the shooting.\u201cThe process was one which was handled with the utmost care, as all investigations must be,\u201d Giddens said in a statement Friday. \u201cAlthough this investigation may have taken longer than some would have liked, we had an obligation to do it right, and that is what we will always do to ensure the citizens of this community can continue to have the faith and confidence in us that we have earned in these past several years.\u201dCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Michael Dunn was arrested Oct. 3. He was arrested Oct. 19. A previous version of this story also incorrectly stated George Zimmerman used Florida\u2019s stand-your-grand law to justify his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. Though Zimmerman\u2019s attorney considered using that statute as a defense, he ultimately did not.Read more:In \u2018classic stand-your-ground case,\u2019 Fla. sheriff says an Uber driver killed a man threatening him\u2018Who did this?!\u2019: Someone put googly eyes on a historic Georgia statue.
