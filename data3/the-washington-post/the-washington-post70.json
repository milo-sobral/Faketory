{"id": "Steelers continue \u2018Le\u2019Veon who?\u2019 portion of season with a critical win over Ravens", "paragraph": " BALTIMORE \u2014 The Pittsburgh Steelers remain in the \u201cLe\u2019Veon who?\u201d portion of their season. Holdout running back Le\u2019Veon Bell still was nowhere to be seen. James Conner, his replacement, again was the focal point of the offense. And the Steelers kept winning, posting their fourth straight victory as they beat the Baltimore Ravens, 23-16, on Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium, enduring an injury scare to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger along the way.The Steelers upped their record to 5-2-1 and stayed ahead of the idle Cincinnati Bengals, who are 5-3, atop the AFC North. They added to mounting woes of the Ravens, who suffered their third straight loss to fall to 4-5.The hold-your-breath portion of the day for the Steelers came when Roethlisberger landed on his right shoulder as he was tackled by Ravens linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith at the end of a fourth-quarter run. Roethlisberger remained on the turf by the Steelers\u2019 sideline as members of the team\u2019s medical staff rushed to examine him.[Biggest moments from an exciting Week 9 of the NFL season]Suddenly, a Pittsburgh offense that has been without Bell all season \u2014 he has refused to sign his franchise-player deal and report to the team \u2014 was facing the prospect of being without Roethlisberger as well.But as Roethlisberger stood on the sideline near midfield, without the medical staff around him, backup Joshua Dobbs delivered a key, 22-yard completion to wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster for a first down on his first regular season NFL pass.\u201cI almost left Josh in after that play,\u201d Roethlisberger said.Roethlisberger said he merely had the wind knocked out of him, an assessment echoed by Coach Mike Tomlin.\u201cYou can\u2019t breathe for a second,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cYou\u2019re laying there. Once you start getting your breath, you start doing an evaluation. I knew right away it wasn\u2019t my head. Then you start talking shoulders, elbows \u2014 \u00adeverything like that. Once I was able to get up, I knew I\u2019d probably be okay.\u201dRoethlisberger trotted back on the field after missing only just that one play and soon provided a 51-yard strike to tight end Jesse James that led to a field goal to extend the Steelers\u2019 lead to 10\u00a0points.Conner did much of the rest, continuing to thrive in Bell\u2019s absence. He ran for 107 yards on 24 carries. He had seven catches for 56 yards and a touchdown. No, he isn\u2019t Bell, but he is doing a pretty credible impersonation, delivering as both a runner and as a pass-catcher out of the backfield.\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything away from James,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut the big boys up front are opening holes. And so it\u2019s a collective effort. James is going above and beyond. I\u2019m more pleased by what he\u2019s doing in the passing game and from a blitz-pickup standpoint. That\u2019s a little bit more unique than the rushing. We knew he could run the\u00a0ball.\u201dConner managed only 19 rushing yards on nine carries when the Steelers lost to the Ravens, 26-14, on Sept. 30 in Pittsburgh. The Steelers haven\u2019t lost since, and it was clear practically from the outset Sunday that this game would be different for Conner. He had his fourth straight 100-yard rushing game and fifth of the season.\u201cThe last time we played them, we had some turnovers and penalties,\u201d Conner said. \u201cWe just had the opportunity to start fast \u00ad[Sunday].\u201dSome, including Steelers teammates, expected Bell to show up before the season. He didn\u2019t. It was reported that he would join the team during its recent bye week, or possibly after last week\u2019s trade deadline. He still hasn\u2019t.The wisdom of Bell staying away and losing more than $855,000 per week of his $14.5\u00a0million franchise deal has been debated exhaustively. But there\u2019s no going back now \u2014 not for Bell and not for the Steelers. If Bell wants to play this season, under NFL rules he must report to the Steelers by Nov. 13.The inclination for the Steelers and their fans might be to take a vindictive approach. They have done well without Bell, after all, but that probably would be the wrong option.If Bell comes back, he probably wouldn\u2019t replace Conner in the lineup but should add value as a complementary player in the running game and as a pass-catcher. He probably\u00a0would make the Steelers better.For the Steelers, the Bell situation isn\u2019t merely about outlasting the Bengals and lapping the \u00adRavens in the division. It\u2019s about battling the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs to be the AFC\u2019s top team. It\u2019s about winning the Super Bowl while they can with Bell, Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown.Bell probably can help that cause during whatever is left of his Steelers tenure."}
