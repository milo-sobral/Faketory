The tornado in Baltimore resulted in two fatalities after a wall caved in at one of Amazon.com\u2019s distribution centers. These were the first tornado-related fatalities in Maryland since 2002.Both tornadoes came without any official warning, although there were signs of potential trouble by Friday afternoon. At the core of the issue was a drastic contrast in air masses, located on both sides of a potent cold front. Additionally, a wave of low pressure developed and strengthened rather quickly right along the front. All of those ingredients resulted in a few hours of extreme and localized instability.Compounding the problem was the presence of heavy rain and the lack of daylight. Deep pockets of heavy rain developed right along the front, which meant that both tornadoes were \u201crain wrapped,\u201d making them somewhat invisible to radar detection as well as to the naked eye. We do have the capability to look through the rain and diagnose rotation with other products. However, these storms were moving fast with a tight and localized rotation signature, making them extremely hard to diagnose in real time.Want our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
