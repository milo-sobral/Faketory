Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost her legs in Iraq. \u201cNo one should ever mock a Veteran for the wounds they received while defending our great nation, regardless of political party or what you think of their politics. Pete Davidson owes Dan Crenshaw an apology.\u201dFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that SNL\u2019s executive producer Lorne Michaels should be fired.Saturday Night Live mocked the appearance of a combat veteran that lost an eye on the battlefield. This was not funny in any way. They scripted it, rehearsed it, laughed at it, aired it and promoted it. VSOs should demand @nbcsnl head Lorne Michaels he fired #FireLorneMichaelsBut Crenshaw \u2014 who lost his right eye in 2012 after a bomb exploded during a mission in Afghanistan, his third military deployment \u2014 said he won\u2019t ask for an apology from Davidson or SNL.\u201cThey probably should apologize, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to demand an apology,\u201d he said Monday on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d adding: \u201cThey certainly crossed the line, but their apology won\u2019t mean anything to me.\u201dWhen asked about the matter on Sunday \u2014 and again on Monday \u2014 NBC representatives said the network would not be commenting.Davidson has not yet responded to the criticism.\u201cThey certainly crossed the line, but their apology won\u2019t mean anything to me\u201d -@DanCrenshawTX explains why he isn\u2019t demanding an apology from SNL pic.twitter.com/mM7XttQIlhDespite being told he would probably never see again, Crenshaw, a Navy SEAL, regained sight in his left eye and went on two more deployments. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a miracle I can see at all and can continue serving the American people,\u201d he said on Fox.Davidson seemed to be aware of Crenshaw\u2019s background during Saturday\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment, in which he gave his \u201cfirst impressions\u201d of various candidates running in this election cycle.\u201cThis guy is kind of cool, Dan Crenshaw,\u201d Davidson said, as an image of Crenshaw wearing an eye patch flashed on the screen.His co-host, Michael Che, chuckled and said, \u201cYo, come on.\u201d\u201cHold on,\u201d Davidson replied. \u201cYou may be surprised to hear he\u2019s a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie.\u201dThe audience laughed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry; I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever,\u201d Davidson added, shrugging and grinning. \u201cWhatever.\u201d[Utah mayor and father of seven killed in Afghanistan on fourth deployment]Online, scores of people have expressed anger over the sketch and demanded Davidson and NBC apologize.\u201cGetting dumped by your pop star girlfriend is no excuse for lashing out at a decorated war hero who lost his eye serving our country,\u201d Jack Pandol, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement that referenced Davidson\u2019s much-publicized recent breakup with singer Ariana Grande.Eric Trump tweeted that NBC and SNL \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves . . . Thankfully, we have brave men & women like @DanCrenshawTX otherwise gutless cowards like #PeteDavidson wouldn\u2019t have a desk to sit behind.\u201d.@DanCrenshawTX is a war hero who has sacrificed so much for our country. Pete Davidson\u2019s comments were abhorrent and SNL owes @DanCrenshawTX and all Veterans an apology. https://t.co/S7i26Boe4UThe Texas Republican Party called the bit \u201cutterly abhorrent.\u201dRep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), another candidate who was mocked in Davidson\u2019s sketch, said the jab at Crenshaw was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and indicated that the comedian should be booted from the show.\u201cWhat are NBC\u2019s standards for firing? PC to insult wounded vets?!?\u201d King demanded, adding: \u201c(Davidson also insulted me. Who cares?!)\u201dI once asked @DanCrenshawTX what was behind his eyepatch. It was a glass eye with a gold Navy SEAL Eagle & trident logo. Such. A. Badass. pic.twitter.com/O6KHW7abR5\u201cThis is outrageous. It isn\u2019t funny at all,\u201d wrote Dana Perino, a Fox News contributor and former White House press secretary. Crenshaw, she wrote, \u201cserved his country \u2014 sacrificed for it \u2014 and now is willing to serve again as a Member of Congress (or whatever).\u201dOn Monday, \u201cThe View\u201d hosts called it a \u201csucker punch,\u201d a \u201ctone deaf\u201d statement and a \u201creally crappy joke.\u201dBut Joy Behar said offensive humor is SNL\u2019s \u201cstock in trade\u201d and that the show \u201cdoesn\u2019t take any prisoners.\u201d\u201cThey took a shot at Alec Baldwin, who is part of their family, so they go after a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this kid Davidson, his father died in 9/11, and he said, \u2018I like making things of a dark, awkward \u2014 weird things that you don\u2019t really find funny, funny. There\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t joke about, and I think it\u2019s because of what happened to me.\u2019\"So, I mean, he\u2019s coming from a place of, you know, you make fun of things that are so painful to lighten the load. That\u2019s where he\u2019s coming from, I think.\u201dFellow SNL cast member Kenan Thompson also acknowledged the challenges that comedians are up against, but he said that Davidson \u201cmissed the mark.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you\u2019re fishing for jokes, like that\u2019s how stand-ups feel \u2014 like there\u2019s no real filters out there in the world when they\u2019re trying to go for a great joke,\u201d he said on the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cBut at the same time, when you miss the mark, you\u2019re offending people. So you have to kind of like really be a little more aware, in my opinion.\u201cHe definitely missed the mark, and I think he was more so commenting on the fact that the joke maybe didn\u2019t land as hard as he wanted to, as opposed to being like, \u2018I don\u2019t care about veterans.\u2019 I think Pete\u2019s a very humble dude, and he\u2019s got a big heart. I don\u2019t think he goes out to offend people. But stand-ups, they\u2019re the ones that help us laugh through the most awful things in the first place, so they\u2019re always fishing in weird places.\u201dIn a tweet over the weekend, Crenshaw acknowledged the overwhelming outrage over Davidson\u2019s remarks.He didn\u2019t demand an apology, but he did urge the show\u2019s writers not to use injured veterans as \u201cpunchlines.\u201dGood rule in life: I try hard not to offend; I try harder not to be offended. That being said, I hope @nbcsnl recognizes that vets don\u2019t deserve to see their wounds used as punchlines for bad jokes.Crenshaw later told TMZ that he didn\u2019t necessarily want an apology.\u201cI want us to get away from this culture where we demand apologies every time someone misspeaks,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be very healthy for our nation to go in that direction. We don\u2019t need to be outwardly outraged. I don\u2019t need to demand apologies from them. They can do whatever they want, you know. They are feeling the heat from around the country right now, and that\u2019s fine.\u201dHe added: \u201cBut I would like [Davidson] and \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 to recognize something, which is that veterans across the country probably don\u2019t feel as though their wounds they received in battle should be the subject of a bad punchline for a bad joke. And here\u2019s the real atrocity in all of this: It wasn\u2019t even funny . . . It was just mean-spirited.\u201dAppearing Monday morning on Fox, Crenshaw suggested that Davidson and his SNL colleagues consider pooling money together and donating to a veterans charity.On Tuesday, Crenshaw told supporters at his victory party that \u201cit\u2019s been an interesting last 72 hours for us,\u201d adding that \u201cI\u2019m from the SEAL team so we don\u2019t really get offended.\u201dRead more:Kanye West praised Trump in a meandering speech on SNL.
