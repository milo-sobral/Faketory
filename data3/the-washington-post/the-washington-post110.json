{"id": "Maryland vs. Ohio State had nearly everything but a breakthrough win for the Terps", "paragraph": "Matt Canada had decided on the final play well before it happened. With Maryland on the verge of a huge upset of the No. 10 Ohio State Buckeyes to achieve bowl eligibility, at the end of a breathless senior day game that featured a remarkable performance by running back Anthony McFarland, the Terrapins' interim coach wanted to play to win \u2014 not to tie, not to bring this matchup into a second overtime.Canada called going for a two-point conversion a gut decision, one he talked over with quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome before Ohio State scored on its possession to open overtime. The two discussed two possible play-calls, and Canada said they both felt good about the play the offense later attempted.But when the chance to win came, Pigrome missed on a throw to an open Jeshaun Jones in the end zone to seal a 52-51 win for the Buckeyes at Maryland Stadium.\u201cEvery game, you want a play back here or there,\u201d Canada said after the loss. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing everybody who doesn\u2019t sit in this [team meeting] room every day, outside in the entire world, didn\u2019t give us a chance. The season was over last week. That\u2019s what everybody thought. We were done. We were written off.\u201dEarlier in overtime, Ohio State had converted on a fourth down with inches to go with a pass from quarterback Dwayne Haskins, a Maryland native who once committed to the Terps. Haskins then threw a touchdown pass to pull his team ahead for the first time all day.Maryland answered, naturally, with McFarland. The redshirt freshman carried to the 1-yard line on the Terps\u2019 first snap in overtime, giving him 298 rushing yards for the game and setting up a Tayon Fleet-Davis score on the next play. McFarland\u2019s total, on just 21 carries, was the second highest in a game in program history and came despite an apparent shoulder injury that temporarily forced him from the game in the fourth quarter.But the failed two-point attempt dropped Maryland (5-6, 3-5 Big Ten) to its third straight loss, and the team teeters on the edge of bowl eligibility heading into next week\u2019s regular season finale at Penn State.A win would have carried significance for Maryland, which has only gone to three bowl games in the past seven seasons; for Canada, who could have made a stronger case for retaining the top job; and the players, who have endured a chaotic season after the death of teammate Jordan McNair. But the Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1) \u2014 and their roster stacked with talent \u2014 barely won out.In the first half, McFarland powered past the Buckeyes\u2019 defense, gaining massive chunks of yardage at a time. On the second play of the game, he notched an 81-yard rushing touchdown. Ohio State responded with a field goal, and the redshirt freshman ran for a 75-yard score on the first play of the subsequent drive.McFarland\u2019s 231 rushing yards in the first half were a team record. His 153 rushing yards in the first quarter were the most in the first quarter by a player in a Football Bowl Subdivision game this season.Ohio State, which had been playing catch-up all day, tied the game at 38 with 3:41 left in the fourth quarter. But Pigrome nailed a 60-yard pass to Darryl Jones to the 1-yard line on the first play of the subsequent drive. On third down, McFarland fumbled the ball as he reached into the end zone but tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo recovered for the go-ahead score with 1:41 remaining.With no timeouts left, Haskins led the Buckeyes down the field to tie it at 45 with 40 seconds left. Maryland still wasn\u2019t done, with Pigrome hitting Taivon Jacobs, a senior receiver, for 30 yards to the Ohio State 38. When about 10 more yards could have brought the Terps into field goal range to win in regulation, Pigrome was sacked for a loss of 14 yards. Ohio State then sacked Pigrome again on a Hail Mary attempt to send the game to overtime.Pigrome, who took over the starting job after Kasim Hill suffered a torn ACL in last week\u2019s 34-32 loss at Indiana, completed 6 of 13 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown. But in a game that had just about everything, he wasn\u2019t the only Terps player who made a big play in the passing game.After Ohio State tied the game for the first time early in the fourth, the Terps called a fake punt on fourth down and Australian punter Wade Lees connected with Jacobs for a 15-yard gain. Not long after, Jeshaun Jones caught a 27-yard touchdown pass on third down for a 38-31 lead.\u201cOur mentality wasn\u2019t to upset Ohio State,\u201d linebacker Tre Watson said. \u201cIt was to beat Ohio State. \u2026 There was not a moment in the game today where we didn\u2019t expect that we were going to win.\u201dMaryland held a 24-17 lead at halftime thanks largely to McFarland and a key stop. With Ohio State driving to close out the first half, Maryland\u2019s Seun Oluwatimi forced a fumble and Ayinde Eley recovered in the end zone, preventing the Buckeyes from tying the score heading into the locker room. When the teams returned, Maryland\u2019s defense again delivered. On Ohio State\u2019s second snap, Haskins threw an interception that RaVon Davis returned 37 yards to the end zone.Through most of the day, however, Haskins tore apart Maryland\u2019s defense, passing for 405 yards and three touchdowns as he completed 28 of 38 attempts. Haskins also had three rushing touchdowns. J.K. Dobbins recorded 203 yards on the ground for the Buckeyes on 37 carries. The Buckeyes finished with three turnovers but 688 total yards.Throughout the season, Ohio State\u2019s defense has struggled to prevent explosive plays, while Maryland has excelled at creating them, as exemplified by McFarland\u2019s chunk yardage. As a whole, the Terps\u2019 running game accumulated 339 yards on 48 carries.Thanks to the rushing success, Pigrome hardly had to throw the ball and made several big plays when he did. But the incompletion that he will remember is the one that came in overtime.\u201cHe put us in the position to win the game,\" Canada said of Pigrome. \u201c\u2026 Being a quarterback, it\u2019s the greatest position in all of sport. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more important than anybody else, but there\u2019s a lot to it, right? You get all the credit. You get all the blame. I know he\u2019s having a tough time right now.\u201dStill, when asked if it would be difficult for the team to come back from this loss, Canada said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard at all.\u201d\u201cLast week everybody in the country said we were done, right?\" Canada said, referring to the loss at Indiana that was considered the Terps' best shot at earning bowl eligibility. \"Said the freaking season\u2019s over. Shouldn\u2019t even play the last two. Our guys will be fine. ... I have no doubt we\u2019ll come back and play really hard next week. That\u2019s who they are.\u201dRead more:\u2018Big Game' between Cal and Stanford postponed due to poor air qualityBarry Svrluga: As Ohio State and Maryland show, a football coach\u2019s record is his leverageFor Taivon Jacobs, six years of football and fatherhood at MarylandDino Babers, college football\u2019s tent revivalist"}
