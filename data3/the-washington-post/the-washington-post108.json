The office building\u2019s aggrieved landlord, Irvine Co., sued after Eagan Avenatti didn\u2019t pay rent for four months, some $213,254 in total.The eviction comes on top of Avenatti\u2019s arrest on domestic-violence charges earlier this week.\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Avenatti said in an email to The Washington Post. \u201cWe have multiple offices. This involves my old firm, which was already in the process of moving due to a dispute.\" On Twitter, Avenatti called the eviction claim \u201cmore nonsense\u201d and \u201c#Garbage,\u201d and he suggested the spreading of the news was politically motivated.[Meet Michael Avenatti, the adrenaline-fueled lawyer taking on President Trump]\u201cFirst, it\u2019s not even my current firm,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, they were already in the process of moving so they didn\u2019t need to be \u2018evicted.\u2019 The right is so intent on eliminating me as a threat, they will do and say anything.\u201d According to the Times, although Avenatti has claimed that Avenatti & Associates and Eagan Avenatti are distinct firms, \u201cthey function as the same law practice with the same lawyers and support staff.\" \u201cThey are not the same firm,\u201d Avenatti wrote in another email. \u201cThey are different entities that use different employees, have different cases, different offices with the exception of one, different bank accounts, different ownership, etc. In fact, Avenatti and Associates was formed in 2006, long before EA.\u201d His claim that it was character assassination was an echo of what he said after he was booked on a felony domestic violence charge on Wednesday, following his release on $50,000 bail. In a statement from his law office after news of the charge spread, Avenatti said the allegations against him were \u201ccompletely bogus.\u201d There is a lot of inaccurate reporting out there. For example, (1) I have NOT been charged with anything, let alone a felony; (2) Lisa wasn't even with me Tues; etc. Numerous other \"facts\" being reported are completely bogus. Why is TMZ's news \"standard\" the new standard?\u201cI have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night,\u201d he said. \u201cAny accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d Avenatti \u2014 who represents Stormy Daniels, the adult-film star who said she had an affair with Donald Trump more than a decade before he became president \u2014 has spoken at Democratic events across the United States, launched a political action committee and said he can be a sharp-tongued foil to the president as part of the Democratic ticket in 2020.[Steve Bannon thinks Michael Avenatti could be a threat to Trump in 2020. Avenatti thinks so, too.]His acerbic nature and combativeness via a variety of media have raised his public profile, as The Washington Post has reported, although there are questions about his background and qualifications.And his actions during the confirmation hearing of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh have some wanting him targeted in a criminal investigation, The Post reported.Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick, who alleged in a sworn affidavit that she was gang-raped at a 1982 party attended by Brett M. Kavanaugh, have been referred by the Republican leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Justice Department for a potential criminal probe over doubts about her claims during Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings.
