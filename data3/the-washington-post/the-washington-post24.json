{"id": "Amid incendiary rhetoric, targets of Trump\u2019s words become targets of bombs", "paragraph": "In the home stretch of the fall campaign, President Trump has called Democrats \u201cevil\u201d and argued they are \u201ctoo dangerous to govern.\u201d He has denounced Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and demonized former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, inspiring chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at his rallies.The president has also used his bully pulpit to taunt Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) as a \u201clow I.Q. individual,\u201d impugn former CIA director John Brennan and fan conspiracy theories about liberal philanthropist George Soros. And he has called the news media \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d singling out CNN\u2019s reporting as \u201cfake news.\u201dThis week, these targets of Trump\u2019s rhetoric became the intended targets of actual violence in the form of pipe bombs, many of which turned up Wednesday.Investigators have not disclosed information about the origin of the packages, and no evidence has surfaced connecting the acts to any political campaign. Still, a common theme among the targets was unmistakable: Each has been a recurring subject of Trump attacks.Law enforcement authorities said packages containing pipe bombs and addressed to the homes of Obama and Clinton were intercepted by the Secret Service, while on Monday, one was found at Soros\u2019s home.In addition, an undetonated device addressed to Brennan was found at CNN\u2019s New York headquarters and another, addressed to Waters, was discovered at a congressional mail-sorting facility. A similar package was found addressed to former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr.Trump and other Republican leaders rushed Wednesday to decry the thwarted attacks on Democrats and CNN, saying that such acts cannot be tolerated. For many politicians, the day was a reckoning \u2014 a sobering pause just 13 days from Election Day to reflect on a political atmosphere notable for apocalyptic imagery and violent confrontations.[Homemade bombs sent to Obama, Clinton, CNN offices and Holder, officials say]Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Trump said he and officials in his administration were \u201cextremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed.\u201d The president sounded a call to all Americans to unite, though he did not address the tone of his own campaign rhetoric.\u201cWe have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America,\u201d Trump said.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) responded in a joint statement: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.\u201dThey went on to argue that Trump has \u201cdivided Americans with his words and actions,\u201d citing his cheers for Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) for body-slamming a journalist; his equivocations over the deadly neo-Nazi and white supremacist rally in August 2017 in Charlottesville; his encouragement of supporters at rallies who have gotten violent with protesters; his praise for foreign dictators who kill their own citizens; and his attacks on the free press as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201dTrump traveled Wednesday evening to Wisconsin for a campaign rally, where he sought to make a show of behaving himself by pointing out during his relatively subdued speech that he was \u201ctrying to be nice.\u201d\u201cNo nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion or control,\u201d Trump told the crowd in Mosinee.[Trump takes aim at media after homemade bombs sent to Clinton, Obama and CNN]Trump again shirked responsibility for his own inflammatory contributions to the political discourse and instead assigned blame to others. \u201cThe media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative \u2014 and oftentimes, false \u2014 attacks and stories,\u201d he said.The president, who has made a sport out of mocking his political rivals with nicknames like \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d also exhorted others in the political arena to \u201cstop treating their opponents as morally defective.\u201dJon Meacham, a journalist, historian and author of the book \u201cThe Soul of America: The Battle for our Better Angels,\u201d said the most divisive political periods of the nation\u2019s history have resulted in violence against political figures. He said he has long worried history could repeat itself in the Trump era.\u201cWe have examples of political violence in the United States in the age of Jackson, in the road to Civil War, during the Civil War, in the Progressive Era and in the cataclysm of the 1960s,\u201d Meacham said. \u201cWhat happened today is a reminder of the stakes of the era in which we\u2019re living. This is an era of fundamental redefinition of politics and culture. It requires leadership that is steadying, not incendiary, and we\u2019ve seen far too much incendiary language from the top.\u201dThroughout the political world, there were widespread calls to quickly bring to justice those responsible.Clinton, speaking at a fundraiser for congressional candidate Donna Shalala in Coral Gables, Fla., thanked the Secret Service for intercepting the package addressed to her home and called it \u201ca troubling time.\u201d\u201cIt is a time of deep divisions, and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together,\u201d she said.[CNN finds itself at the center of the news as a mail bomb forces evacuation of its New York office]House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who survived a shooting that targeted lawmakers at an Alexandria baseball field in 2017, wrote in tweets, \u201cThese attempted attacks that have been made are beyond criminal, they are acts of pure terror. Violence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society.\u201dHe added, \u201cAs a nation, we must agree that this is a dangerous path and it cannot become the new normal.\u201dWhen asked Wednesday whether some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric might have contributed to the mailings, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) defended the president.\u201cA lot of things could have contributed to that,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything really wrong with the president. I think that, you know, he\u2019s in a tough position, he\u2019s attacked on all sides and he ought to be able to express himself.\u201dBut Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has long bemoaned the disappearance of civility from the nation\u2019s politics, said Wednesday that it was obvious to him that the attempted attacks were \u201cpolitical.\u201d\u201cWhat the president says matters, and if he were to take a more civil tone, it would make a difference,\u201d Flake said in an interview on CNN. \u201cCivility can\u2019t wait until after an election. The president shouldn\u2019t refer to the press as the \u2018enemy of the people.\u2019 .\u2009.\u2009. People hear that and they follow it.\u201dCNN President Jeff Zucker said that the White House has \u201ca total and complete lack of understanding\u201d about the consequences of their attacks on the media.\u201cThe president, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand their words matter,\u201d Zucker said in a statement. \u201cThus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\u201dTrump has long assailed the targets of the packages. He regularly excoriates Obama\u2019s presidency and was a leading proponent of the falsehood that the nation\u2019s first black president was not born in the United States.Despite defeating Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, Trump still goes after her in his speeches, inspiring chants from crowds to \u201cLock her up!\u201d Before Trump\u2019s appearance at the Wisconsin rally Wednesday, the crowd erupted in a \u201cLock her up!\u201d chant while Senate Republican candidate Leah Vukmir was attacking Clinton.At his rallies, Trump also routinely mocks Waters and attacks CNN as reporting \u201cfake news,\u201d to which his rally crowds regularly chant back, \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d And Soros has long been a target of far-right groups and the subject of conspiracy theories with anti-Semitic overtones.In the wake of angry protests over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation battle, Trump and other Republicans have tried to cast Democrats as the party of the \u201cmob\u201d and attempted to link specific candidates to radical figures on the left.[The instant, inevitable cries of \u2018false flag\u2019 after bomb threats targeting the Clintons, Obamas and CNN]A number of Trump\u2019s supporters advanced the \u201cfalse flag\u201d theory on social media and talk radio, arguing that the potential explosive devices may have been sent by liberals with the intention of reversing the \u201cmob\u201d argument and painting Democrats as victims of unruly conservatives.Explaining the theory, conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh said on the air Wednesday, \u201cFor the last few weeks, the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR, all of these angry mobs .\u2009.\u2009. Wouldn\u2019t it serve you up here if you\u2019re a Democrat operative to make it look like the Republicans are a bunch of insane lunatics and have some mobsters on their side as well?\u201dThe \u201cmob\u201d frame has not only been a feature of Trump\u2019s rally speeches, but also central to some GOP campaign advertising.In Minnesota\u2019s rural 1st Congressional District, the National Republican Congressional Committee has repeatedly sought to tie Dan Feehan, an Army veteran who was awarded a Bronze Star, to leftist anti-fascist activists who have clashed with police and right-wing protesters.\u201cFeehan works at a liberal organization bankrolled by George Soros, chief financier of the global left and anti-American causes,\u201d a narrator says in one spot, as the sound of smashing glass plays over images of anarchist protesters.
