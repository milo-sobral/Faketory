Tuter said that there was no evidence of voter fraud and that Brenda Snipes, the county election supervisor, needs to be allowed to do her job and finish the count.Tuter also appeared to admonish the Scott team for suggesting voter fraud without offering evidence of it.It may be about time to put the entire state into receivership.* Rick Hasen says that if you think what\u2019s happening in Florida right now is bad, just wait until the 2020 election.* Colby Itkowitz runs down 12 likely targets of Democratic congressional investigations.* David Roberts explains the effects the midterm elections will have on climate policy.* Karen Tumulty argues that the president treats the military like nothing but a prop.* The latest Gallup poll puts Trump\u2019s approval at 38 percent.
