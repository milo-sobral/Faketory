If jade eggs are not in large collections and not in supporting texts, how could they be known to an actress in Hollywood?\"So, did the researchers find anything close to the jade egg?Gunter says that they found a butt plug \"used to keep chi in after death \u2013 so our search terms were valid.\"The legal investigation into Goop was launched last year after a consumer watchdog alerted a task force of Californian prosecutors to over 50 alleged spurious health claims being made by the company for a range of products on its website.Goop asserted that the jade egg (designed to be inserted and held in the vagina for extensive periods of time) could \"balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control\".The settlement with Santa Clara County's District Attorney prohibited Goop from making any claims about the efficacy or effects of their products without \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\".Despite deleting the copy detailing its benefits and offering refunds to customers who had already purchased the egg, it is still for sale on the retailer's website.Last week the Good Thinking Society, a British charity that promotes scientific skepticism, also reported Goop to the UK National Trading Standards and Advertising Standards Authority with allegations that the company is violating over 113 advertising laws.Goop did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed NewsGreat!\n        \n          You're almost there!
