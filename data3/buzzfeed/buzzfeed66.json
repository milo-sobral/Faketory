I rarely eat it in general because I\u2019m not a big fan, but when I do I separate the cheese and toppings from the base and sauce. I\u2019ll eat the cheese and toppings like one meal with a knife and fork and then do the same thing with the pizza dough.\" \u2014ashleyc4163c8ffd\"Rice and bananas are one of my favorite combinations.\" \u2014miss_sarah_mamo\"Chocolate cake and sour pickles and mustard sandwiches are one of my grandma's bizarre faves.
