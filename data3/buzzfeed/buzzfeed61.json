Plus, organic sugar, an organic tea blend, and a kombucha culture and liquid starter.\"I've been wanting to try my hand at making kombucha for a few years now, but was afraid of making it wrong and becoming deathly ill. Also, I admit, the scoby kind of freaked me out. One of the blogs I follow recently reviewed this kit and I decided to go for it (and besides, paying upwards of $3.50 per bottle at the store was getting ridiculous). I am so happy I bought this kit! I'm currently brewing my second batch as my first batch came out awesome! I made a ginger/orange flavor and a strawberry/lemonade flavor from that first batch and they taste even better than what I can buy at the store. And no more fear of the scoby! I actually enjoy looking at it daily to see what new changes have occurred overnight. I think it's safe to say I will never buy store-bought kombucha again!\" \u2014Cheflene\"It has everything you need to start a first batch of kombucha. It includes clear instructions for how to make, and how to continue your kombucha for the second batch. Now I\u2019m making my third batch, and loving it so far. After the first batch, you will need to find your own tea leaves and sugar, but it\u2019s fun trying different tea to see how different they all taste. It\u2019s also fun trying different fruits/spices during the second fermentation. If you purchase this kit as your first kombucha investment, you can brew your own kombucha forever, only needing to buy additional tea leaves and sugar.\" \u2014Meg\"Amazing product. Easy instructions and addicting hobby. I love this product and would recommend to anyone looking to start brewing their own kombucha.\" \u2014Lisa FucciReviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.19 Things That'll Make Drinking Tea Even Better18 Foods That'll Basically Last Forever28 Delicious Snacks On Amazon That People Actually Swear ByGreat!\n        \n          The {{categories}} Newsletter{{quantity_prefix}} will be hitting your inbox soon.\n        \n      Great!\n        \n          The {{categories}} Newsletter{{quantity_prefix}} will be hitting your inbox soon.\n        \n      BuzzFeed HomeSitemap\u00a9 2018 BuzzFeed, Inc."}
