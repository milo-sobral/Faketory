{"id": "\"The Princess Switch\" Has Dropped On Netflix And It's So Damn Fun", "paragraph": "\n          \n          Move over A Christmas Prince, there's a new Netflix royal romance in town.\n        In case you can't tell from the poster, it stars Vanessa Hudgens as an ordinary baker from Chicago, and also a duchess from the made-up country of Montenaro. The two women bump into each other and decide to switch places (naturally), and hijinks ensue (naturally).It's a joy.*I have been informed this guy is very crush-worthy in Nashville, but alas, I have never seen the show. It's on my (ever-growing) list, don't worry.He's Baker Vanessa's best friend/business partner, by the way.Meddling kids, meddling and/or magical old people, meddling queens, holiday baking competitions, makeover montages, royal balls, visits to orphanages, sleigh rides, snowball fights...you name it, this movie has it.To be clear: this is a good thing. You watch these kinds of movies for cheesy, tropey goodness, and The Princess Switch delivers exactly that in spades.Or at least until A Christmas Prince 2 drops.Great!\n        \n          You're almost there!
