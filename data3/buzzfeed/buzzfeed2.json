{"id": "Here's What The \"Riverdale\" Teens Look Like Playing Their Parents In A Flashback", "paragraph": "\n          \n          It totally works.\n        I for one am very excited about it. We'll learn more about all the adults' relationships with each other \u2013 not to mention their involvement with the mysterious Gryphons & Gargoyles game that has resurfaced in Riverdale.And the young actors playing the younger version of their parents actually works so well. Just check out these shots from the flashback episode compared with the '90s versions of the older cast...KJ has nailed that forehead crinkle.The strands of hear flopping on his forehead really make it.These two could actually be related.It's all about the centre part.The style is on point.It's not easy to find pictures of young Martin \u2013 but I totally buy this.Young Nathalie is without the iconic Blossom red hair but this is still a pretty good match.Okay, this one is PURE fan theory, but I love it so I'm including it. A lot of people think that because Madelaine is sporting different glasses and styles in these photos, she may be playing TWO characters in the flashback. Many believe in addition to Penelope, she's also playing Archie's mother, Mary. If true, this could mean Mary is secretly a Blossom relative, which means Archie would be related to Cheryl AND Betty. Wild.Although I will forever question the fact that these kids married each other and then pumped out babies at the EXACT same time. But it's probably, like, the 1000th least ridiculous thing about Riverdale, tbh.Great!\n        \n          You're almost there!
