Promising review: \"I've now had three bottles of this protein powder, and I love it. If you're doing any kind of muscle building or weight training, this will help ensure you get the protein you need without having to overstuff yourself. I can say without a doubt it has improved my recovery times and allowed more training, which has improved my results. This was recommended to me by a coworker and it has lived up to its reputation, in my opinion.

I put this on a cotton ball and wipe over my entire face after shaving. It kept any bumps or ingrown hairs from forming.

It's cruelty-free and safe for your entire family to use. Price: $15.19 for three bottlesPromising review: \"This is by far my favorite litter to use for my two cats. It is extremely light and easy to clean up, shovel, and even vacuum. I never see it tracked all over the floor like when the regular 'heavy' litter is used. My cats also seem to really like it. It clumps up perfectly; it's almost fun cleaning the litter box. I also really love that it\u2019s light because it\u2019s no fun carrying heavy items from the car. I will keep buying this brand.\" \u2014REckerPrice: $16.64+ for a 17-pound container (available in two scents)These blotting sheets are gentle on your skin and the perfect size for travel. Just pop a packet into your purse. Promising review: \"These, are, in a word \u2014 AMAZING. Convenient size, easy to dispense, and environmentally friendly to boot. These natural fiber wipes are just great. I have naturally oilier skin. Even after heavily cleaning my face, the oil will be back within an hour. These wipes work well \u2014 and FAST \u2014 they should be called 'presses' because no wiping is required. You simply need to hold it against your cheek/forehead/chin/etc., and two seconds later your skin is MUCH less oily to the look and touch. These wipes won't leave your skin feeling dry. One wipe is enough to sort out my face and neck. The best part of all \u2014 if you're environmentally conscious like myself and others, you'll feel guilt-free using these and disposing of them appropriately.\" \u2014DSPPrice: $11.95 for two packs (available in two versions)With 360-degree protection, you'll feel safe to move around freely.

He is 9-months-old now and we have been using them for about six months and we have no regrets! They continue to work great even now that he is very active and moves around much more. They are easy to put on and remove and the tabs don't get stuck to the diaper.\" \u2014Keri OPrice: $31.70+ (available in two style and seven ages)These bones are vegan! Promising review: \"LOVE that these bones are vegan! The junk put in dog food and dog treats is actually disgusting. These have all-natural ingredients and are meat-free! Our larger dogs finished them off quickly, but our smaller dogs took longer to eat them. All six of our dogs love them!!\" \u2014Scott G.Price: $11.49+ for 10 bones (available in two sizes)Upon purchase, you'll receive three sheets: a 7\", a 10\", and a 13\".

Whether you like the environment or not, they are secure, sculpt-able, don't need a rubber band, and don't seem to impart any smell onto the food they're covering. Especially nice for covering cookie dough in the fridge while you cook a batch here and there.\" \u2014Ben DonaldsonPrice: $17.10These wipes will remove dirt and grime from any surface in your home. And the bonus? They're biodegradable! Price: $13.16 for 186 wipesI own this hair mask and really love it. After using it, I notice a definite difference in how my hair feels. The texture is much smoother and softer, and I have less frizz and fly-aways. I typically use it after I shower. I apply it to my damp hair, leave it on for 5\u201310 minutes, and then wash it out.Promising review: \"I have to say this is the best conditioning product I have ever used. I have thick, naturally wavy hair that has been a nightmare my entire life. It does what it wants, it gets extremely frizzy in both humid and dry conditions, and it tangles easily. I didn't think anything would make that much of a difference, but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I am so happy I did. I use just a little once or twice a week as a quick conditioner and then when my hair starts really frizzing and look dull and damaged. When I rinse and dry after, it's like I have different hair. No frizz, no dryness \u2014 it's soft, silky, and smells great! I also get far fewer tangles than I used to and the ones I do get are much easier to comb out, which is a big plus for me. I've been using it for over a year now, and I always make sure to rinse it out completely. No greasiness, no heaviness, just soft, silky, awesome feeling hair.\" \u2014timonsgirlPrice: $12.30 for a 8.45-ounce containerThis drink is nutritionally a full meal, packing 400 calories, 20 grams of protein, 150 milligrams of caffeine. It's also dairy- and gluten-free. Promising review: \"I decided to try this after hearing about it on my favorite podcast (Stuff You Should Know), and I am so glad I did! I am a busy young professional who is moderately health-obsessed. I found myself eating out WAY too often (several times a week) when I started a very competitive and time-consuming job. Once I didn't have the time to meticulously prepare everything I ate, I began gaining weight and losing energy. I put off trying Soylent because I am a picky eater but I decided to take the risk. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! I am now drinking half a bottle every morning for breakfast and the other half around 3 p.m., and it has completely changed my diet for the better. I am no longer starving throughout the day and binging on takeout when I finally get the chance to eat. I am losing weight, saving money, and finally getting back to my regular workouts. Stop thinking about it, and just try it. You won't regret it.\" \u2014ljg98Price: $32.58+ for 12 bottles (available in four flavors)Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been taking Biotin for a year now and have noticed a SIGNIFICANT change in how quickly my hair grows, its luster, and the length and thickness of my nails. My hairdresser has even noticed! I\u2019ve also recently started bleaching my hair platinum again, and unlike last time when I was not taking Biotin, my super long hair still looks and feels healthy and isn\u2019t breaking! My nails have gotten thick and healthy! They grow so quickly I have to have them done every other week. They look beautiful and I\u2019ll never go another day without Biotin!\" \u2014JEN A.Price: $9.85 for 120 softgels16 family-sized rolls equal 40 regular rolls.
