{"id": "Why We Should All Take More Pictures Of Our Ugly Food", "paragraph": "\n        Natalya Lobanova / BuzzFeed\n      \nThere are two types of people: people who post their food on Instagram and people who hate them. I fall into the former. Years ago, I jokingly posted an unflattering, unfiltered picture of my jacket potato with chilli and cheese on top to \u201cbreak up all the pretty food on your timeline\u201d, but since then the meals worthy of recognition on my profile haven\u2019t often been the ones that made me go back for more, but the ones with a garnish that made me go \u201cooooh!\u201d before picking it off. We post photos of burgers as tall as our heads, or of acai bowls that somehow encompass every colour of the rainbow, but the one thing that nobody posts a photo of is their \u201cugly\u201d food. In fact, someone calling your Instagram picture of a meal ugly is a comment embarrassing enough to make you want to delete your account.But when I think of good food, I don\u2019t always think of jewel-red tandoori chicken \u2014 it\u2019s also brown daal and beige aloo paratha. Korean food isn\u2019t just an inviting, colourful bowl of bibimbap; it\u2019s also a bright orange, slightly misshapen kimchi pancake. The food we share online is often less about what we like and more about what we want people to think we like: the flattering idea that you\u2019re someone who goes to food pop-ups to have a taco/burger/hot dog hybrid, or who arranges their fruit into a geometric pattern and wakes up at 6am to have a smoothie and do yoga. But if food is a way of telling people about our lives, so much of the best-tasting stuff is getting cut out of the picture.We all filter things; I conveniently crop out the burnt-on pasta sauce stains on my cooker when posting a photo of my bakes, and pictures I take inside of restaurants are often only ever of that one floral wall they specifically put there for people to take pictures of. You can be self-conscious about sharing your cooking in case it looks bad even though it tastes great, or about posting a picture of the dinner you had a restaurant if there aren\u2019t enough vibrant colours in it and the lighting is a bit poor. In fact, in the UK, a third of fruit and veg is apparently deemed too ugly to sell. But we\u2019re mammals, and food, even the prettiest food, is fuel, so an apple with shiny peel will lodge between your teeth just like a duller one.\u201cBut nobody wants to see my crappy food!\u201d If it tasted great, why not share it? Sure, a watery omelette with floating, pale mushrooms might not be something you\u2019d want to post, but a cheesy bolognese bake? A huge pot of really good chilli? I\u2019m probably not the only person to have photographed some fancy brunch that had fake flowers on it, only to pick around the food and then just order a cake instead. When I make my favourite gingerbread cake, I don\u2019t pour over the toffee icing until after I\u2019ve taken some photos, just because I worry the icing makes it look \u201csloppy.\u201dWhen you\u2019re sharing the food that makes up your life online, it\u2019s worth remembering that the breadcrumb-topped mac and cheese you make at home and the completely beige chow mein you eat in front of the TV when you go to your friend\u2019s house are also part of the picture. Don\u2019t feel embarrassed that the banana bread you baked doesn\u2019t seem to have a \u201cgood\u201d angle if it was so nice you went back for seconds, or if the camera doesn\u2019t make your biryani look as good as it tasted. We might not ever want to show the \u201cugly\u201d side of our lives on social media, but ugly food is what you eat at home after a crap day, or what you have when catching up with a friend, or what you order at a restaurant you like that hasn\u2019t cottoned on to the \u201cfeature wall\u201d thing yet. Things don\u2019t have to look good to taste good, and what tastes better than the food you really, truly want?Great!\n        \n          You're almost there!
