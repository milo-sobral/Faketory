In addition to the pitta breads, the bakers had to make three dips, including a baba ganoush and smoked pepper salsa.The technical challenge should never be something even the judges couldn't do themselves. That was just unfair nonsense #GBBOThis is officially not baking (according to google definitions) #GBBO #GBBOFinalTwo challenges and not one oven used on Bake Off. BAKE off.\n\nB A K E.
