{"id": "So, Uh, That Urban Legend About Human Ashes At Disney Parks Is Actually True", "paragraph": "\n          \n          Have a magical day!\n        The WSJ spoke to former custodians who worked at the parks, as well as to families that spread ashes themselves.According to the WSJ's sources, ashes have also been spread \"in flower beds, on bushes, and on Magic Kingdom lawns; outside the park gates and during fireworks displays; on Pirates of the Caribbean and in the moat underneath the flying elephants of the Dumbo ride. \"\"This type of behavior is strictly prohibited and unlawful,\" a Disney spokesperson told the WSJ. In fact, anytime you spread ashes on private property, you'd better ask for permission first. Even if you're spreading ashes in a national park or at sea, there are EPA rules you have to follow and you usually need a permit first.Apparently the code for cleaning up human ashes is a \"HEPA cleanup,\" and custodians will use a HEPA-filter vacuum to clean up the remains.BuzzFeed HomeSitemap\u00a9 2018 BuzzFeed, Inc."}
