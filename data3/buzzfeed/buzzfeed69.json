I travel to Las Vegas from Houston a few times a year, and the climate change is so drastic that I usually am in pain from being so dried out!! I used this product every night during my stay and felt great!! I even came home and didn't get sick like I usually do after traveling! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a convenient humidifier that is easy to travel with and move around!!\" \u2014KevinGet it from Amazon for $24.99.Promising review: \"The Immune+ version of Emergen-C is truly a different experience. You get a much nicer fizzle and pop, which is very refreshing when the urge arises to clear out some junk from a germy day or trip. The Super Orange flavor is clearly the best (I have tried the others) and this is an excellent way to get some quick vitamins really anytime through your day. Also the small packets make it very easy to travel with.\" \u2014Andrew Get it from Amazon for $16.12.The bottle is watertight (duh), dishwasher-safe, and folds down to AN INCH for easy travel!Promising review: \"I have been backpacking through Europe for about a month now and this water bottle has saved me space and hassle on countless occasions.

Would def recommend!\" \u2014Glenda BatesGet it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in black and white).Poo-Pourri has garnered over ELEVEN THOUSAND REVIEWS on Amazon, and the verdict is in: This shit works. Promising review: \"I have these sprays in every bathroom in my home. I also travel with them, because you know how it is in a hotel with the bathroom right there by where you're sleeping... I also keep one at work, although I had to start hiding it in the bathroom because apparently other people love it as much as I do and decided to take it home with them. I highly recommend. So much more effective than the 'courtesy flush.' By the time you do that one, the problem is already 'out there.' With Poo-Pourri, it never has a chance. I haven't met a scent I didn't like so far. What a great idea!\" \u2014Kindle CustomerGet it in a variety of travel sizes from Amazon for $4.95+.It also boasts 24-hour wear, so your pits can stay busy without worrying about *the funk*.Promising review: \"More people need to know about this stuff. It simply stops odor and lasts forever. It is like magic rock. I only have to put it on every other day and my pits are absolutely smell-free. I only wish I would have found this stuff years ago. I can't believe how affordable this is too. If more people knew about this, it would put the deodorant industry out of business! Just wet the crystal or put it on after your shower the crystal needs to be moist to work. Leaves no residue at all and kills the stink for days! The travel-sized container is perfect and it lasts forever.\" \u2014Michael SmithGet it from Amazon for $3.Promising review: \"I always have these with me. It\u2019s so critical as a full- time traveler. They\u2019re small and stashable and make any quick sink laundry job effective. And I get to have my favorite brand from home, which is so nice when you're away. I consistently stock up on these after every trip.\" \u2014World TravellerGet a three-pack from Amazon for $3.58.Promising review: \"These are a great size for traveling. Not too bulky. The sound comes in very clear. I like to use them on planes because they also block out the surrounding noise pretty well and are more comfortable for my ears than earbuds.\" \u2014micheleGet them from Amazon for $24.99 (available in eight colors).Promising review: \"Love love love these!! I bought these for traveling for about two months in Central America. I have been traveling by bus/air and staying in hostels/hotels and private homes. These little babies have been lifesavers since many bathrooms are fine and many on the roads are questionable. I put a pack of seat covers in my travel backpack with a small roll of toilet paper, make a little kit, and I am good to go!!\" \u2014Cynthia LeeGet a five-pack on Amazon for $8.46.The umbrella has been reviewed over 5,000 (!) times on Amazon! It weighs less than a pound and has a 42-inch diameter. So efficient! Promising review: \"Have had it for months now and what a lifesaver! I travel a lot so I keep this tucked in my briefcase for those 'moments of unexpected downpour.' Well let me tell you, it happens and this thing springs into action (pun intended) and is compact and light but large and strong! Highly recommend.\" \u2014FlennGet it from Amazon for $21.95 (available in six colors).Promising review: \"I made the mistake of buying Marvis toothpaste once, and I was hooked. I have since tried using a travel size of Colgate when I was traveling and I hated it! Marvis texture is not gritty at all and it leaves your teeth feeling so smooth. It also seems to be more concentrated, so you don't need to use as much on your toothbrush. It is more expensive than other toothpastes, but it lasts longer. Available in several different amazing flavors, this really is worth every penny. But you might have to justify to your spouse why you need to spend this much on toothpaste. Once they try it, however, they'll be hooked as well.\" \u2014AlanGet it from Amazon for $6 for 1.3 oz. or $10.50 for 3.8 oz.The notebooks measure 3.5 inches by 5.5 inches and contain 48 pages of ruled paper to fill with your hopes, dreams, and letters home. Promising review: \"Perfect small notebook to take with you on the go and write down information that you might forget. I always carry one with me and write down stuff that I would not likely remember when I get home. These pads are not bulky and easily fit in your back pocket or jacket pocket without becoming annoying. A must for people teeming with ideas that they would forget later on. Write them down on the spot and never forget anything again!\" \u2014Fred AdelmanGet them from Amazon for $9.95.The 1.6 oz. bottle is TSA-friendly.Promising review: \"This product works very well. I have very dry and brittle hair in general, so I try to only wash my hair to to three tmes a week if possible, but I also stay active, so this really helps extend and freshen my hair especially in the summer months. Works just as well as higher-priced brands. I keep this on hand at home, in my gym bag and when traveling for work, and it's hard to fit in time for washing, drying and re-styling my hair before my next meeting. This is really a lifesaver.\" \u2014Erin CisselGet a three-pack from Amazon for $11.37.I fall asleep listening to podcasts! So sue me! I'm afraid my phone will die in the night and won't wake me up, ok?! This trusty clock has no bells or whistles. Well...except for the one you need to wake up. Promising Review: \"Love it, love, it, love it! I have been a flight attendant for 39 years and am frequently changing time zones on my layovers. I always use a backup battery-powered alarm clock and need to often change the alarm. This has been my best one yet! It is simple to use, and has all the necessary features for me. I am now ready to retire but I will be using this on all my future leisure travels.\" \u2014Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in black and white).This teensy razor can be refilled with any Venus blade, so you can reuse the handle every time you hit the road. Promising review: \"My only problem with this thing is that I can't go back in time with it! This thing would have been so useful back in college, or in my overnight bag for trips with friends, and a ton of other situations! I LOVE that you can change out the heads on it and keep using it. When I initially bought mine I thought it was a single-use razor. Thank goodness that it's not!\" \u2014JDGet it from Amazon for $8.39.Promising review: \"I love this teapot for travel. I am not a coffee drinker, and using the hotel coffee pot for my hot water was gross. No tea drinker wants to taste coffee in her tea. This pot is small enough, I can even haul it in my backpack to the office I'm visiting. It brews two mugs of water. I'm very happy with this little kettle of joy.\" \u2014Just a Girl From KansasGet it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in white and black).The reviews in this post have been edited for length and clarity.23 Products That'll Keep You Organized When You're Traveling17 Stylish Travel Products You Need In Your Life27 Of The Best Travel Products You Can Get On AmazonGreat!\n        \n          The {{categories}} Newsletter{{quantity_prefix}} will be hitting your inbox soon.\n        \n      Great!\n        \n          The {{categories}} Newsletter{{quantity_prefix}} will be hitting your inbox soon.\n        \n      BuzzFeed HomeSitemap\u00a9 2018 BuzzFeed, Inc."}
