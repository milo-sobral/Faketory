{"id": "Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee dies at 95", "paragraph": "Stan Lee, who wrote and published a comic book legacy that spans from the Depression Era to the present day, who created Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk and Thor, died Monday at the age of 95. Under his longtime leadership, the publisher known today as Marvel Comics now oversees a portfolio of heroes and villains beloved by millions of fans and reaping billions more at the box office. News of Lee\u2019s death was first reported by TMZ. Joan Celia Lee, Stan\u2019s daughter, confirmed the news to TMZ. The Hollywood Reporter is also confirming the news.\n    Related\n  Lee\u2019s wife, Joan Lee, died in July 2017, following complications resulting from a stroke. The two married in 1947, and their daughter Joan Celia Lee was born in 1950. His later days, since Joan\u2019s death, have been characterized by a snarl of elder abuse accusations between his daughter and several family friends, culminating in a restraining order and criminal charges being levied against his former manager, Keya Morgan. Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber in New York City in 1922, the son of Romanian Jewish immigrants, and at the age of 17, he began work as an assistant at Timely Comics, the company that would become Marvel Comics. Filling inkwells and fetching lunch, Lee\u2019s career began just in time for Superman\u2019s 1938 debut in Action Comics #1, kicking off the history of superhero comics. His first published story was entitled \u201cCaptain America Foils the Traitor's Reve\u201d \u2014 published under the nom de plume \u201cStan Lee,\u201d which he would later make his legal name \u2014 and it was the first story in which the hero ever threw his shield as a ricocheting weapon. When Captain America creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left Timely after disagreements with the company, decimating the business\u2019 editorial staff, Timely publisher Martin Goodman appointed Lee, then just 19 years old, as interim editor. From the temporary post, Lee would rise to editor-in-chief and remain there for more than 30 years, until he rose even further to the non-editorial post of publisher of Marvel Comics. The only interruption of his tenure was the wartime years of 1942 to 1945, when Lee served in the United States Army in various roles during World War II, including writing manuals and training films. Under his editorial guidance and prolific pen, Timely completed its metamorphosis into Marvel Comics, fundamentally changing what audiences expected from superheroes and the folks who created them. Beginning with The Fantastic Four #1 in 1961, Lee spearheaded Marvel\u2019s rocketlike rise to success and popularity \u2014 cementing the company in a never-ending battle with its chief competitor, DC Comics. After stepping back from writing monthly comics in 1972, Lee went west in the early \u201980s to focus on Marvel films and television projects, eventually leaving Marvel Comics altogether. His later career was characterized by a wide variety of projects and newly founded companies producing wild \u2014 if perhaps not as titanically successful \u2014 creative endeavors. Collaborative methods of comics writing were already widely used when the Marvel revolution began. The writer would provide a brief plot synopsis, the artist would plot and draw up the story, and then the writer would return to the finished pencil art to write dialogue and captions. Both creatives held significant influence on plot and character design. But Lee used this system so successfully to churn out stories that it has simply come to be known as the Marvel Method. Lee\u2019s greatest editorial achievement, perhaps, might be defying the Comics Code Authority in order to publish an explicit anti-drug message in Amazing Spider-Man #96-98, a move that eventually created enough buzz to convince the CCA to liberalize its rules, weakening a set of strict, self-censoring content guidelines the industry had adopted more than 15 years before. But the revolution that Lee is most credited for is introducing flawed characters to the genre of superheroes \u2014 and making them incredibly popular. The tale goes that when given the assignment of creating a superhero team to rival the recently recreated Justice League, he was encouraged by his wife, Joan, to write whatever sort of story he wanted to, rather than what he thought his editor might be interested in. At the time, Lee had been planning a change in careers, and if the book had flopped there wasn\u2019t much to lose. That book, co-created with Jack Kirby using the Marvel Method, was The Fantastic Four #1. It was the introduction of a team now known as Marvel\u2019s First Family, not least because it set the foundation for the rest of the Marvel Comics universe. Collaborating with artists through the Marvel Method, Lee shares co-creator credit on virtually every pillar of Marvel\u2019s universe. With Gene Colan, he created the Falcon, the first African-American superhero. With Bill Everett, he introduced Daredevil. With Steve Ditko, he developed Doctor Strange and Marvel\u2019s challenger in sales to DC\u2019s Superman: Spider-Man. And with Jack Kirby \u2014 one of the few comics creators who has cast as large a shadow on the industry as Lee \u2014 he created and popularized not only the Fantastic Four, but also the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Panther, the Avengers, the X-Men and the Inhumans. Lee also revived older Golden Age characters like Captain America and Namor the Sub-Mariner, after they had spent decades out of the publishing eye. And while he crafted complex, flawed and conflicted heroes \u2014 characters who might fall out and reunite with their closest allies as often as they battled evil \u2014 he also championed an editorial style that made creators more visible to the reader. Granted, Marvel Comics was no exception to the American comics industry\u2019s historical failings in the realm of respecting creators\u2019 rights and compensation. Lee\u2019s ceaseless hucksterism sometimes left frustrated collaborators in its wake, most notably Jack Kirby himself. But \u201cSmiling Stan\u201d Lee\u2019s eccentric editorial voice created a familiar and relatable notion of Marvel creators in the minds of fans, appealing to a younger, more politically active generation of readers at a tumultuous time in American history. Monthly issues featured Lee\u2019s creator profiles of the members of the \u201cMarvel Bullpen\u201d and his cheerful editorials in \u201cStan\u2019s Soapbox.\u201d A \u201cNo-Prize\u201d was offered to any reader who wrote in with a solution to a plot hole. And fans of Marvel Comics even had their own name to distinguish themselves from the rubes reading the \u201cDistinguished Competition\u201d (or \u201cBrand Echh\u201d). They were \u201cTrue Believers.\u201d Lee\u2019s impish editorial self followed through to his public persona (at the age of 61, he posed in his underwear with a giant-sized issue of The Incredible Hulk covering his pelvis to create the illusion of a naked centerfold spread for a Marvel magazine). If modern fans don\u2019t know Stan Lee from his comics, they\u2019ll know him from his comedic cameos in nearly every Marvel Comics-inspired movie under the sun \u2014 and as a tireless advocate for the wonder of storytelling in all forms. In one of his final interviews, Lee told the Daily Beast that he hopes \u201cI leave everyone happy when I leave.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t leave anyone happy,\u201d his daughter interjected.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mean happy that I left,\u201d Lee explained, \u201cHappy that I took the right path.\u201dComics writer Gail Simone has described the first time she met Stan Lee numerous times: a chance encounter at a con when he was unexpectedly brought on to a panel alongside her. \u201cKeep in mind, Stan was being STAN LEE during the panel, the whole EXCELSIOR! thing, you know. Great fun to watch, but it\u2019s definitely part of his mystique,\u201d she wrote on her Tumblr. \u201cSo he came up to me, and was smiling, being STAN LEE, and asked, \u2018So, what do you do?\u2019\u201dI blushed and stammered a bit and said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m just a writer.\u201d  For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t even remember to tell him I had written for Marvel for a bit.And this odd thing happened. The STAN LEE character dropped away and he looked me dead in the eyes, VERY SERIOUSLY, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t EVER say you\u2019re \u2018just\u2019 a writer.\u201d... after a minute, it hit me, he wasn\u2019t scolding me, he was giving me quite possibly the best advice I had ever gotten, in the simplest, most direct way. He was saying, don\u2019t minimize what you do, don\u2019t apologize for choosing this career. I believe he was saying stand up straight and say it with pride ... That changed everything for me. Until that point, I had really struggled with telling people what I did for a living. I would say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just comics,\u201d or would avoid the subject entirely. Brian Bendis and Jeff Loeb and others had sat me down and tried to tell me that it was not endearing, it was a bit insulting to the readers, but I didn\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t understand that it was borderline rude, until Stan Lee told me in one sentence with the full weight of his personality and absolutely zero nonsense.It\u2019s no surprise that Lee crafted so many characters that have endured into a time where they\u2019ve overwhelmed an institution as dominant as the modern Hollywood blockbuster. Publicly, Lee was as much a character as any of his fiction, delivering iconic catchphrases like \u201c\u2019Nuff said!\u201d and, of course, \u201cExcelsior!\u201d Excelsior is the state motto of his native New York \u2014 Latin for \u201cever upward\u201d or \u201cstill higher.\u201d And it was Lee\u2019s habitual sign off and rallying cry, a fitting exclamation for a man who revolutionized a genre obsessed with the power of flight. Lee will be both missed and honored by the legions of people whose lives were lifted still higher by the stories he spun, and the legends he left behind. "}
