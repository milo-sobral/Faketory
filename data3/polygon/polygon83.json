{"id": "The infinite horrors of Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Mr. Mime", "paragraph": "If you\u2019re anything like the people in the Polygon offices, you\u2019ve probably spent most of the day somewhere between captivated and horrified by the first trailer for the upcoming Detective Pikachu film. Whether it\u2019s a version of Jigglypuff that is entirely too real, the voice of Deadpool coming out of a small CGI mouse or these terrifying still images of the sculptures they made for the film, there\u2019s no shortage of things to have strong feelings about in this trailer. But, one of the Pok\u00e9mon people have had the most positive reaction to in the trailer is Mr. Mime\u2019s scene near the end. This is not the correct reaction to Mr. Mime. The correct reaction is abject horror. At first glance Mr. Mime appears to be only somewhat strange looking. Sure, he looks a little like a person dressed halfway between a clown and a mime, but we know he\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon so we\u2019ll give him a pass. But let\u2019s take a slightly closer look at his appearance and the reason behind it. First thing\u2019s first: What\u2019s on top of his head. It looks like it\u2019s just his hair right? Well, turns out that\u2019s not exactly true. The official entry for Mr. Mime on Bulbapedia says this, \u201cblue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head.\u201d Yep! Those \u201cblue growths\u201d are basically just horns that for some reason look like clown hair, and it gets worse. See those shoes? They aren\u2019t shoes. \u201cIts dark blue feet curl upward at the tips,\u201d says Bulbapedia, which means that whatever is growing out of Mr. Mime\u2019s head is also growing out of the bottom of his legs and for some reason makes feet/shoes for him. So, technically he could probably stand on his blue horns. If you\u2019re starting to get the idea that Mr. Mime doesn\u2019t actually wear clothes, despite how he may look, you are correct. Every part of him, from what looks like a poofy white shirt, to his terrifyingly-large gloved hands, are just his body. He\u2019s just shaped that way ... all the time. But if you\u2019re still willing to look past his objectively monstrous exterior, the mythology around Mr. Mime is even stranger. According to an almost ageless internet fan-theory, in the Pok\u00e9mon anime, Mr. Mime \u2014 or a specific Mr. Mime \u2014 might be Ash Ketchum\u2019s father. The evidence for this isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call overwhelming. Basically, a wild Mr. Mime often helps Ash\u2019s mom around the house and seems to have an extremely close relationship with her. Add this on to the fact that Ash doesn\u2019t know his father and, much like Pok\u00e9mon in the universe, never seems to age, and fans have decided that Ash must be some kind of half-human, half-Pok\u00e9mon hybrid. Also there\u2019s this screenshot from the anime, which we aren\u2019t even going to talk about. The evidence is obviously thin here, but the fact that it\u2019s a theory that\u2019s still worth talking about is reason enough for us to never mention Mr. Mime again. There are plenty of reasons to be excited about the new Detective Pikachu movie. The trailer has genuine charm and uses a song from the Shrek Swamp Karaoke Dance Party \u2014 both equally important facts. There are also plenty of reasons to be justifiably terrified of the photo-realistic Pok\u00e9mon. But the one thing that\u2019s clear is that no matter how funny his scene in the trailer may be, Mr. Mime is terrifying. "}
