{"id": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Oct. 30 Blackout change list", "paragraph": "The latest patch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\u2019s Blackout mode is here, and there isn\u2019t anything too groundbreaking about it. But the mode is getting a few important bug fixes and quality-of-life updates.Perhaps the biggest change is coming to the mode\u2019s armor, which is going to let a little bit more damage pass through now. While complaints about the mode have been limited, players with armor that\u2019s a little bit too strong has come up a few times from the community.The way Blackout\u2019s audio works will also be changed. The system has been reworked to give players a better idea of which direction the footsteps they\u2019re hearing are coming from, something that\u2019s critical to staying alive in any battle royale game. This patch was all part of Treyarch\u2019s Oct. 30 update to Black Ops 4, which included a ton of other \u2014 non-Blackout \u2014 changes to the game. These changes are only for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at the moment, with a PC-specific patch on the way in the near future.PlaylistsAudioArmorCharacter Missions\u201cItem Found\u201d NotificationsCalling Card ChallengesUIMiscellaneous"}
