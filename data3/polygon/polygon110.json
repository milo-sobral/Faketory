{"id": "The best comedies of 2018, so far", "paragraph": "Laughter: not actually the best medicine for serious ailments, but still pretty great! (We suggest a doctor for those serious ailments.)Somehow forecasting just how gloomy and caustic 2018 would turn out to be, the movie industry stepped up its game over the last 10 months and delivered genuinely funny comedies \u2014versus, say, American Pie 8: Butts in Cake or whatever \u2014 that kept slapstick and satire and joyous stupidity soldiering on. These movies won\u2019t probably win Oscars, but they will win you over when you watch them over and over on HBO. Simply put: they\u2019re funny.Our rolling list of the best comedies of the year ranges from laugh-out-loud to devilishly sharp to cheeky in that British way. And before you laugh us off: yes, we\u2019ll update again before the end of the year with a few more picks, just in case any more films squeeze a chortle out of us before year\u2019s end. If you\u2019re looking for more recommendations, check out our more general list of the best movies of 2018.Polygon Essentials is a collection of persistently updated lists of the best of the best games for each platform \u2014 from the hardware\u2019s launch to its end of production \u2014 as well as the best entertainment across virtually every medium.

Half the tale focuses on three young women who make a pact to lose their virginity on prom night, the other half on the attempts of their parents to stop them from making good on that promise. The film is startlingly sensitive and level-headed when it comes to how it deals with its subject matter \u2014 and it\u2019s also wickedly funny.Female sexuality has long been so codified that it\u2019s refreshing to see the characters in Blockers either begin at, or come around to, a place of respect when it comes to women\u2019s rights to make decisions about their own bodies. That\u2019s not to say the film sacrifices laughs for the sake of commentary; the cast, which includes Leslie Mann, John Cena and Ike Barinholtz as the hapless parents, is uniformly great, with the expected body-related humor cranking all the way up to 10.\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeThere was a post-Judd Apatow era (that we still may be in?) in which every comedy cranked out by the studios felt like an improv-a-thon conducted in point-and-shoot style, as if they were TV shows fitted for the big screen. The joy of Game Night \u2014 besides stars Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams in prime fish-out-of-water mode \u2014 is a return to the \u201970s and \u201980s logic that a comedy should look and feel like a drama, but with jokes. Writer-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (Vacation) use shadowy interiors, classic camera moves and a thriller toolkit to treat this wacky comedy about a role-playing murder mystery party gone off the rails with the vibe of After Hours. The key is that Game Night still has the sensibility of a 7-year-old with a bucket of magic markers. Bateman, McAdams and the rest of the cast are in full Clue mode as they scramble in the suburbs trying to figure out why Bateman\u2019s brother was just beaten to a pulp and dragged out of his McMansion. Jesse Plemons co-stars as a cop with a ridiculous desire to make friends. He has a snow-white puppy whose fur does not react well to bloodstains. Game Night is pure chaos \u2014 the snazzy kind.\u2014Matt PatchesStream it on HBORent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeIn his debut film, Boots Riley has crafted a vision of contemporary America that will absolutely knock your block off. Sorry to Bother You is incredibly dense \u2014 there are a million things happening in each scene \u2014 yet clear in vision. The less you know about it going in, the better.For now, let this suffice: Lakeith Stanfield stars as Cassius \u201cCash\u201d Green, whose job at a telemarketing company takes a turn when a co-worker recommends that he use a \u201cwhite voice\u201d on his calls. However, as he starts to do so \u2014 and sees the according uptick in sales \u2014 the company is rocked by a strike by workers demanding fair pay, which means that, as things progress, Cash is forced to take stock of where he stands and pick a side.\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeThe Marvel movies that have been the most cursorily related to the broader cinematic universe are almost uniformly the best, and Ant-Man and the Wasp is no exception to the rule. It\u2019s an easy-breezy ride through the quantum realm, and surprisingly morally nuanced. When it seems that Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who disappeared into the quantum realm, might actually still be alive, Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) team up to try to get her back \u2014 and contend with the mysterious Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) along the way. The cast (including Michael Pe\u00f1a, who almost ran away with the first film) is so charming that the usual superhero antics feel fresh \u2014 not that Ant-Man wasn\u2019t novel to begin with. He shrinks! He grows! It\u2019s a weird superpower to have (or have via supersuit), and the film knows exactly how to have fun with it.\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeNetflix has been upping its game when it comes to original films, throwing its weight behind potential Oscar contenders like Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma. But it has also invested in crowd-pleasers like To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, Ibiza and Set It Up, hoping to become synonymous with a renaissance in comedy. Among the best of this year\u2019s offerings is Like Father, a startlingly poignant comedy starring Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer, and written and directed by Lauren Miller Rogen. After being left at the altar, Rachel (Bell) finds herself on a cruise \u2014 which she had originally booked for her honeymoon \u2014 with her long-estranged father (Grammer). The film is just as likely to make you laugh as it is to make you cry, and provides the opportunity for both in spades.\u2014Karen HanStream it on NetflixIf you\u2019ve been wondering what happened to the high-society comedy, look no further than Crazy Rich Asians, which revives the genre with a splash. Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an economics professor at NYU, is thrust into a world that\u2019s almost completely foreign to her when she agrees to meet her boyfriend Nick\u2019s (Henry Golding) family in Singapore. They\u2019re not just any old potential in-laws \u2014 they\u2019re crazy, they\u2019re rich and they don\u2019t take kindly to Rachel\u2019s arrival on the scene. As she\u2019s put through the wringer, navigating both Nick\u2019s family and the Singaporean elite, the film shines, literally and figuratively.\u2014Karen HanAvailable to rent starting Nov. 20Armando Iannucci has long been known for his acerbic wit \u2014 any Veep fans that haven\u2019t seen The Thick of It are missing out \u2014 and it\u2019s in full force in the startlingly dark The Death of Stalin. The film, which is a take on the events following, yes, the death of Joseph Stalin, has its share of laughs, but it\u2019s a little grimmer than, say, In the Loop. The jockeying of Stalin\u2019s Central Committee \u2014 featuring Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev and Simon Russell Beale as Lavrentiy Beria \u2014 is outrageous, and Iannucci digs his heels in not only with regard to the lengths these figures went to in order to stay in power, but with regard to the death toll that resulted. Bodies fall left and right, and after a while, whatever comedy there was in the preceding wheeling and dealing becomes pitch-black.\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeThere\u2019s reason to be skeptical of a movie that stars Boston Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving as an old man and is based on a series of Pepsi Max ads. But Uncle Drew, which uses the Blues Brothers blueprint to get Irving\u2019s Drew back together with his old team (Shaq, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller and Nate Robinson, also in old-age makeup), is proof that there\u2019s still room in this cynical world for a quality-yet-artless crowd-pleaser built off the charisma of high-profile athletes. Why are basketball stars so capable of carrying their own comedies \u00e0 la Space Jam? Just look at the Harlem Globetrotters, and understand why court skills and hijinks go hand in hand. Add in Lil Rel Howery, the breakout from Get Out, and you have a comedy that hits nothing but net.\u2014Matt PatchesRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeTen years after the film adaptation of the ABBA musical Mamma Mia hit theaters, we\u2019ve been gifted with the follow-up, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Like the original film, Here We Go Again is an unmitigated delight \u2014 and a little more unhinged, as it throws all laws of time and logic to the wind in favor of beach scenes and ABBA covers. Though the film is ostensibly about Sophie\u2019s (Amanda Seyfried) attempt to open a bed-and-breakfast in memory of her mother (Meryl Streep, and Lily James in flashbacks), the plot doesn\u2019t really matter. Here We Go Again is the filmic equivalent of canceling all your plans and taking some \u201cyou\u201d time \u2014 plus, Cher arrives at a party on a helicopter and immediately starts singing \u201cFernando.\u201d What more do you want?\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeWith works like Wallace & Gromit and Chicken Run, the stop-motion titans at Aardman Animations have proved themselves masters of balancing humor and empathy. Their latest film, Early Man, fits right in. There\u2019s a glee present throughout Nick Park\u2019s tale of a group of cavemen fighting to win back their land from a collection of Bronze Age foes (including Tom Hiddleston as the pompous Lord Nooth). Then again, perhaps \u201cfight\u201d isn\u2019t the right word \u2014 their chosen method of settling who gets the valley is a soccer match. Early Man is a riot, and in case you need more fancy duck content, it features a duck in one of the funniest sight gags ever committed to film.\u2014Karen HanStream it on HBORent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense in The Spy Who Dumped Me, but there\u2019s also a genuine core to the film when it comes to portraying relationships between women in a thoughtful and honest way. The spy in question is Audrey\u2019s (Mila Kunis) boyfriend, whose top secret she takes on with her best friend Morgan (Kate McKinnon) after he\u2019s killed in action. Directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel, The Spy Who Dumped Me is full of beats \u2014 in between all the requisite spy thriller action \u2014 that should feel familiar to anyone watching, including a scene in which Morgan forces Audrey to appreciate her accomplishments thus far. Similarly, the film itself seems to ask the audience \u2014 its female audience, in particular \u2014 to stop apologizing and embrace being themselves.\u2014Karen HanRent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTubeThough Paddington 2 was released in 2017 in the U.K., it hit U.S. cinemas in 2018, qualifying it for this list and our love. As improbable as it might seem that a movie ostensibly targeted at kids \u2014 and a sequel, no less \u2014 would make any year-end list, Paddington 2 is a must-see. Its message of kindness and empathy feels particularly essential this year, and in the hands of director Paul King (The Mighty Boosh), the film never panders to its audience. The cutest, most colorful sequences are earned.When Paddington Bear (sweetly voiced by Ben Whishaw) winds up in jail for a crime he didn\u2019t commit, his cellmates and his adoptive family come together in order to get him out and prove his innocence. Though the performances \u2014 including Brendan Gleeson as the gruff Knuckles McGinty \u2014 are uniformly great, Hugh Grant is the standout member of the cast. His turn as aging actor Phoenix Buchanan earned him a BAFTA nomination, and in a just world, would get him an Oscar nomination, too. \u2014Karen HanStream it on HBORent it on Amazon | iTunes | Vudu | Google Play | YouTube"}
