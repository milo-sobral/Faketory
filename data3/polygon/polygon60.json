{"id": "What makes Haruki Murakami\u2019s books so alluring, yet near-impossible to adapt", "paragraph": "With his new film Burning, writer-director Lee Chang-dong embarks on one of modern cinema\u2019s greatest challenges: adapting Japanese author Haruki Murakami. The critically renowned author is known for books like Norwegian Wood, adapted into a passing 2012 film, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which no one in the film world seems daring enough to attempt, both of which have earned him crossover acclaim in America. But unlike such populist, literary titans like Stephen King, filmmakers haven\u2019t reaped his bibliography for big-screen ventures. While \u201cBarn Burning,\u201d the short on which Burning is based, isn\u2019t the first of shorts to make it to screen, the film is the first major adaptation of Murakami\u2019s work to have picked up awards (at the Cannes Film Festival, nonetheless) and receive unanimously positive reviews.   There\u2019s a reason: in Murakami\u2019s work, emphasis is placed on the mundane aspects of everyday life as opposed to focusing on what may seem to be ostensibly more \u201cinteresting.\u201d While Murakami\u2019s mundane doesn\u2019t always offer a quick fix in terms of gratification, it is by no means ordinary; his prose can enchant even the most stagnant, passing thoughts. Take this quote from \u201cBarn Burning,\u201d written from the perspective of the story\u2019s protagonist:You burn barns. I don\u2019t burn barns. There\u2019s this glaring difference, and to me, rather than say which of us is strange, first of all I\u2019d like to clear up just what that difference is.Murakami\u2019s short collection The Elephant Vanishes, in which \u201cBarn Burning\u201d is included, subverts the idiomatic \u201celephant in the room\u201d by having characters speak their thoughts, as opposed to merely thinking them. The main character, who admits to burning barns, is completely open about his obsession. The man who he is speaking to has no fear when he asks as to the nature of the eponymous barn burning, either. All thoughts are spoken, which makes the atmosphere more familiar than it should be. The weird and arbitrary nature of the act of barn burning is normalized as the people in the story address it in a way that makes it so.This atmosphere alone proves difficult to adapt. Although the characters are just speaking, it\u2019s the transition back and forth from dialogue to narration that rips the story out of the ground. It\u2019s the certainty of the written word that makes sure abstract concepts can be embedded in the mundane. The screen needs to communicate the atmosphere through kinetic action such as dialogue and visuals. It is far harder to create a setting in which nothing is strange when the viewer can see everything that is happening, like in the abstract setting of \u201cBarn Burning\u2019\u2019 that hosts the calm discussion over a couple of shared joints.This principle is addressed in several of Murakami\u2019s works. In The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, the protagonist Toru Okada sees his wife and cat leave him suddenly and separately for equally mysterious reasons. It takes Okada confining himself to the pitch darkness at the bottom of a well to be able to see things from a more detached perspective. In Norwegian Wood, Murakami writes, \u201cif you\u2019re in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit tight until your eyes get used to the dark.\u201d The common denominator here is the fact that you need to patiently look at the nothingness contained in mundane corners of the world in order to see them as something extraordinary. It\u2019s easier to do this when these things are metaphysical, contained within words alone; when they become visual, they become more familiar, more real, and far more difficult to deal with in this way.Murakami\u2019s oeuvre as a whole tends to focus on the mundane aspects of everyday life. For example, in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Okada takes great pains to illustrate in detail the 13 steps that are necessary to perfectly iron a dress shirt. He spends many of his unemployed days people-watching with a coffee and a donut, and the book takes no pains to get from A to B in a hasty manner. Readers sit with Okada for several pages at a time, watching him watch the world, drinking in the mundane aspects of the strange thing we know as existence. Murakami regularly inserts these ostensibly dull kinds of stories into his fiction, and for good reason.For Murakami, mundanity holds a charge. This charge can be electrified in order to elevate the ordinary to the extraordinary at a moment\u2019s notice. However, the sparks are few and far between, Murakami instead threading his observations through the space between electrified moments. In his 2014 novel Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and his Years of Pilgrimage, Murakami places particular emphasis on the names of the protagonist and his friends. Kuro, Shiro, Aka, and Ao, or black, white, red, and blue; the colored names of Tazaki\u2019s friends are what ultimately make him feel eponymously colorless. In a world of obfuscation and color, Tazaki observes the happenings around him, without ever touching brush to palette himself, an unfortunate man who had been born with a name meaning \u201cto build.\u201d Although the charge imbued in the novel\u2019s naming practices remains dormant for quite some time, the names of the protagonist\u2019s friends are eventually revealed as the catalyst that set his Kafkaesque ostracization in motion.In fact, it is his friend Haida, \u201cgray,\u201d who voices the novel\u2019s self-conscious proclamation that \u201cyou discover a depth to it you don\u2019t notice at first. Most of the time it\u2019s hidden behind all these embellishments.\u201d Whereas cinema so often focuses on action such as visuals, gestures, light, and sound, Murakami\u2019s fiction is based on the subtleties buried beneath the embellishments of the ostensible written word.  In \u201cSuper-Frog Saves Tokyo,\u201d a short story from his compilation After the Quake, Murakami offers a dramatic contrast with the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Tokyo a few days after the 1995 Kobe earthquake. As ordinary cityfolk go about their daily routines, Katagiri plans to venture beneath the city with a six-foot-tall frog in order to fend off the Worm that threatens to destroy Tokyo with another devastating earthquake. Despite its fantastical nature, this story is consistent with the other stories in the collection, even before it uses the \u201cit was all a dream\u201d defense, because Murakami\u2019s writing allows a reader to suspend their disbelief in a way that\u2019s more difficult for a film that will inevitably deal in the literal. While a film must offer a visual version of Super-Frog, Murakami can persuade you of Frog\u2019s existence by making his presence consistent with the proposed logic of the text, and the collection as a whole. At times, the reader forgets that the person in the narrator\u2019s kitchen is actually a giant amphibian who is proposing a surprise attack on a Worm beneath the Tokyo Security Trust Bank. In the same way that Toru\u2019s mundane instructions for ironing a shirt are electrified, Super-Frog\u2019s supernatural nature is subverted by the fact that stylistically it is deemed to be ordinary. This is why the adaptation of \u201cBarn Burning\u201d has the potential to truly excel; in order to communicate the space necessary in a Murakami story, a film must tackle a much more contained story, where the narrative is at its most potent in the sparse moments dotted throughout a mundane atmosphere. American scholars have deemed the cinematic approach to this kind of text as \u201cslow cinema.\u201dIn a standard edition of The Elephant Vanishes, \u201cBarn Burning\u201d is about 20 pages long. Although all 20 pages are well-written, the main moments in the story are when the narrator smokes a joint with a man who confesses to be a barn burner, and the subsequent scene of the two discussing whether or not the man burned the barn he had been intending to burn. Burning is a 148-minute film, a running time fit for Murakami\u2019s pace. Consider Norwegian Wood, a novel in which Murakami\u2019s tragic hero falls deeply in love with his dead best friend\u2019s girlfriend. There are a handful of pages in this novel devoted entirely to inner monologues and symbolism. This kind of thing can be transposed into cinema, but delicately. By taking a short story as its subject, Burning might capture the essence of Murakami\u2019s style as well as the content without eliminating any of the key moments. People all over the world were disheartened when they learned that The Hobbit was being converted into a trilogy, despite only having around 300 pages of content, depending on the edition. However, the opposite holds to be true with Murakami \u2014 while The Hobbit suffered from not having enough pages, Murakami\u2019s \u201cBarn Burning\u201d works for precisely that reason. The Hobbit was supplemented with apocryphal content from the back catalogue of Tolkien\u2019s notes; Burning may indulge a few of the director\u2019s preferential choices, but it has room to do so without compromising its status as a Murakami story.Murakami does the same in his stories, enchanting the mundane, electrifying the ordinary so that it becomes extraordinary. As the inimitable Percy Bysshe Shelley once wrote, \u201cPoetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar.\u201d In the Japanese writer\u2019s case, it\u2019s about breathing room, a lesson Burning seems to employ by adapting the short story into a two-and-a-half-hour-long film. As reviews reflect, \u201cBarn Burning,\u201d and its adaptation is not about who burned the barn, why he did, or how he did, but about the difference between he who burns barns and he who doesn\u2019t.The best way to analogize this is to take a scene from Norwegian Wood, during which the main character, Watanabe, and his friend, Midori, sit on the balcony above the Kobayashi Bookshop, listening to music. Across the way a building is on fire (Murakami loves his flames). They sit there, not talking, drinking in the scene. There is no chaos, no fear, no danger. Midori strums her guitar while they sit there and watch the building burn. There is no pressure to recognize the strangeness of the fire, as it is just another aspect of the backdrop to life that is mundanity. It spikes electric now and then, but ultimately, the most normal thing about life is that none of it is normal. As Watanabe and Midori watch the flames swallow the building, the reader sits beside them in the calm within the storm."}
