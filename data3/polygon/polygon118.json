The latest teaser isn\u2019t much, but hints at a tie to the hell-world planet of Apokolips, and finally gives us a premiere date: Jan. 4, 2019. The brief teaser shows the planet Earth with strands of DNA floating in space, before switching to the fiery world of Apokolips, home of the evil side of the pantheon of New Gods. The second season of Young Justice ended with a visit to Apokolips, as villain Vandal Savage rendezvouses with the planet\u2019s undisputed ruler, Darkseid. The finale was a major cliffhanger, but unfortunately the show\u2019s cancellation had already been announced when it aired and we never got to see just how the ties to Apokolips panned out. Young Justice aired on Cartoon Network\u2019s DC Nation block from 2011 to 2013 and quickly became a fan favorite. After its cancellation, there were many campaigns to bring the show back and in 2016, DC announced a third season, which would air on streaming platform DC Universe. Other DC Universe shows include the current series Titans, and upcoming live-action adaptations of Doom Patrol, Swamp Thing, and Stargirl.Previous Young Justice: Outsiders footage showed off returning characters and a new cast, but this is the first time we\u2019ve gotten a nod to the untouched plot point of Apokolips.
