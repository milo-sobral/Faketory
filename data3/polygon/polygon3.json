{"id": "Getting fired from a Miyazaki movie was \u2018a good thing\u2019 for this anime director", "paragraph": "With the kind of brand recognition and clout that Studio Ghibli has built up over the past 33 years, getting picked to direct a film for the legendary animation studio seems like a huge breakthrough for any up-and-comer. Not so for Mamoru Hosoda, one of Japan\u2019s freshest, most respected anime auteurs in recent years. Hosoda, whose credits range from the original Digimon anime to this year\u2019s fantasy film Mirai of the Future, told Polygon that forfeiting a huge Studio Ghibli gig helped grow his career for the better.In 1999, Hosoda\u2019s first film premiered in Japan. The short film Digimon Adventure served to introduce the franchise to audiences, premiering a day prior to the TV anime\u2019s premiere. Although it was attached to a Pok\u00e9mon-like multimedia machine, Digimon was different \u2014 it had heart, and humor, and human leads with realistic relationships. After Hosoda\u2019s follow-up theatrical short, Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!, came out in 2000, both he and the series earned increasing critical praise in their home country. Hosoda\u2019s work had won the attention not only of young audiences, but of the biggest animation company in Japan.\u201cWhen I did the Digimon movie, Ghibli producer [Toshio Suzuki] came to me, saying, \u2018We have a feature coming up. Do you want to work on it?\u2019\u201d said Hosoda, speaking to Polygon during a Western press tour for Mirai. That movie was Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, based on the beloved fantasy novel by Diana Wynne Jones. Hosoda was asked to direct, a huge get for a director who had previously only directed one feature-length film.But after a few months, Hosoda was off the project. \u201cI was really excited, but with Ghibli, there\u2019s a certain ... tone, and rules they had to follow,\u201d he explained.Some ex-employees have alluded to what those may be in interviews about working at the studio. In 2016, former production coordinator Hirokatsu Kihara described Ghibli as a place with high turnover, where co-founder Hayao Miyazaki (the award-winning director of Spirited Away, Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service and more) dominated all of his fellow creatives. Hosoda wasn\u2019t as harsh as Kihara, who said one person in charge \u201cspeaks like a Yakuza and rules [Ghibli] like a politician.\u201d But Studio Ghibli\u2019s core focus on Miyazaki was incompatible with his vision.\u201cI was told to make [the movie] to similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but I wanted to make my own film the way I wanted to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference between the film I wanted to do and ho they wanted to do it was too great, so I had to get off the project.\u201dMiyazaki certainly comes off as strong-willed \u2014 and slightly cynical \u2014 in The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, a documentary that takes us inside Studio Ghibli during the production of the director\u2019s then-final film. And both he and fellow co-founder Isao Takahata were in charge of the majority of Studio Ghibli\u2019s films during their tenure. Since their simultaneous departures, the animation company\u2019s release slate has slowed to almost a complete halt.Hosoda, now the head of his own studio, doesn\u2019t regret walking away from the house of Miyazaki \u2014 a film that Hayao Miyazaki went on to direct himself, after it was put on ice for two years. Howl\u2019s Moving Castle has maintained a huge fanbase since its 2004 premiere, even with its early production troubles. Meanwhile, Hosoda has had the chance to assert creative control, achieving commercial and critical success on his own.\u201cIf I had to make Howl\u2019s the way Ghibli wanted me to make it, I think my career would have been over,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got off the project, people thought, \u2018Oh, he failed, he\u2019s over.\u2019 But it\u2019s a good thing that I went on to make my own thing, instead of making it the way Miyazaki would have made it.\u201dIn 2006, Hosoda released The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, a coming-of-age film that immediately compelled critics to name him \u201cthe next Miyazaki.\u201d Subsequent works include Summer Wars and The Boy and the Beast. Mirai, the latest in his slate of heartstrings-pulling, fantastical anime, will show in select theaters nationwide beginning Nov. 30. "}
