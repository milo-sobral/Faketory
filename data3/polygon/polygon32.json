{"id": "The beta that isn\u2019t", "paragraph": "The first beta test for Fallout 76 \u2014 or B.E.T.A., as it\u2019s officially known \u2014 has come and gone. It lasted from 7-11 p.m. EDT on Oct. 23, and performance chugged, even when playing on an Xbox One X. But that\u2019s the point; it\u2019s a beta test. It\u2019s not supposed to be polished or highly optimized. The goal is to figure out where that polish or optimization needs to go, based on the data collected during the test. \u201cWe all know with the scale of our games, and the systems we let you use, that unforeseen bugs and issues always come up,\u201d developer Bethesda Game Studios explained in an open letter to the Fallout community on Monday. \u201cGiven what we\u2019re doing with 76, we know we\u2019re opening everyone up to all new spectacular issues none of us have encountered. [...] We need your help finding them, and advice on what\u2019s important to fix. We\u2019ll address all of it, now and after launch.\u201d You\u2019ll sometimes hear about something being a \u201creal\u201d beta test in discussions about this sort of thing, and that\u2019s due to the fact that modern beta tests can sometimes feel more like demos. There will always be some players who are upset if the game they play during the beta test isn\u2019t the game they want to buy at launch, no matter how well a publisher or developer tries to manage expectations before the test goes live. The Fallout 76 beta is different from other betas in that it\u2019s not a map or two, and players weren\u2019t limited to part of the experience for those initial four hours. This was the whole game, and players were free to explore and do as they wished while it was live. The acronym itself stands for \u201cbreak-it early test application,\u201d with the pronoun \u201cit\u201d referring to the entire game. Nothing was held back during those four hours, at least that we know of. And last night was just the first stage of access; the servers will be turned on and off at different times between now and the game\u2019s launch on Nov. 14. Data will be collected and changes will be made. If it all falls apart? Well, that\u2019s just part of the plan. \u201cDuring the B.E.T.A. one of our primary goals is to stress test and break the game,\u201d the Fallout 76 team wrote on the beta\u2019s official FAQ page. \u201cAs such, the servers will not be running 24/7; instead, they\u2019ll be online during targeted timeframes so we can get as many people as possible playing at the same time. Why? Because that\u2019s the best way put all our systems to the test and see how they respond.\u201dThe other interesting detail is that Bethesda plans to let you keep any progress you\u2019ve made during the beta when the final game is launched. You\u2019re not just testing the game; you\u2019re playing the game, in a meaningful, persistent sense. The gear and levels you\u2019re gaining during the test will give you an advantage when the final game launches. It matters. \u201cOur current plan is for your progress to carry over once Fallout 76 officially launches on November 14,\u201d the writer of the official FAQ states. \u201cStay tuned for more information.\u201d Entry into the beta is automatic if you pre-order the game through Xbox Live, the PlayStation Network or the Bethesda Launcher for PC players, or you can use the code given to you when you pre-order the game through another retailer to unlock your beta code using the following steps: There\u2019s no indication that Bethesda will cap these test at a maximum number of players, so I\u2019m going to assume that if you buy the game, you\u2019re in the beta. This is one of those situations that isn\u2019t quite early access, but it\u2019s not quite a traditional beta test either. It\u2019s full, early access to the game for a price, with the ability to carry your time playing the beta into the full version, which has a definite release date. It\u2019s almost like a highly disciplined form of early access, without the baggage that comes with those words. And we\u2019re going to be seeing more of this sort of thing as more developers and publishers push their biggest series into become online services; the launch of Battlefield 5 almost seems like it\u2019s taking place across a number of months. Fallout 76 doesn\u2019t have a beta, not exactly, but it does have a way that anyone can pay to play an unfinished version of the game early and begin a journey that they\u2019ll carry with them onto the final game. So what do you call that? "}
