{"id": "Behold: Breath of the Wild\u2019s latest amazing fast-travel trick", "paragraph": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is just the game that keeps on giving. More than a year and a half since it launched, players are still finding new ways to break the game to the benefit of both them and us, who watch these clips with wide-eyed wonder. A Chinese player, who emulated the game on PC, found the latest way to transform Link\u2019s Hylian journey into a high-speed spectacle. A clip of Link slowing down time to jettison himself off a Bokoblin is making the Reddit rounds, and thank goodness for that, because it owns. How this trick seems to work is that Link hurtles downward, ready to do some shield surfing. Right as he lands on the Bokoblin\u2019s shoulder below him, he whips out his bow and arrow and readies his aim; that slows down time automatically, as it always does. Sheathing the weapon again somehow triggers a reaction that lends Link enough momentum to just ... sail through the air, seemingly indefinitely.There are tons of examples of players messing with Breath of the Wild\u2019s physics to give Link an in-air boost. This one, though, is perhaps my favorite; maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the most recent one I\u2019ve seen, which helps. But it\u2019s also indicative of the longevity of this masterful Nintendo game. Think you\u2019ve seen everything Breath of the Wild has to offer? Nope. And you may never will."}
