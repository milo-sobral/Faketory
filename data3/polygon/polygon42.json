{"id": "Game of Thrones prequel series casts Naomi Watts", "paragraph": "We may not know exactly what the upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff series are going to be about, but we do know at least one cast member: Naomi Watts. The actress, who has started in films like King Kong and The Ring, will play a \u201ccharismatic socialite hiding a dark secret,\u201d according to Entertainment Weekly.While there are a variety of Game of Thrones spinoffs in the works at HBO, this particular bit of casting appears to be specific to the show that is being developed by writer Jane Goldman, who has written films like X-Men: First Class and The Woman in Black, and A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin. While the exact story of this series hasn\u2019t been revealed yet, HBO has given a brief description of the show, which is set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. It seems the series will chronicle Westeros\u2019 transition out of the Age of Heroes, a peaceful era early in the kingdom\u2019s history, and into the Long Night, when the world was nearly destroyed by the White Walkers and the Night\u2019s King \u2014 exactly the forces that returned to threaten Westeros again at the end of the show\u2019s latest season.We also have a few hints from Martin himself, who wrote in June:We\u2019re very early in the process, of course, with the pilot order just in, so we don\u2019t have a director yet, or a cast, or a location, or even a title. (My vote would be THE LONG NIGHT, which says it all, but I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s where we end up. More likely HBO will want to work the phrase \u201cgame of thrones\u201d in there somewhere. We\u2019ll know sooner or later).Game of Thrones\u2019 final season is set to air sometime next year, which means that any prequel series likely wouldn't premiere until 2020 at the earliest."}
