{"id": "Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go! gives you the whole starter trio", "paragraph": "Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go! limits your partner pick to one of two Pok\u00e9mon: Eevee or Pikachu, depending on which version of the Switch game you get. What with these being Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue makeovers, though, this may be disappointing. Maybe you just want to pal around with your starter Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle from the start.Thankfully, you can truly have it all in Let\u2019s Go!, and with ease. All three of the original starters can be yours relatively early on into your adventure \u2014 and there\u2019s even a chance to own more than one of these rare Pok\u00e9mon.Bulbasaur is likely the first of the starters you\u2019ll pick up as a gift along your travels. In Cerulean City, a woman who lives near the Pok\u00e9mon Center will have a Bulbasaur with her. But she has no need for the grass-type Pok\u00e9mon in her life anymore. If you\u2019ve already caught 30 Pok\u00e9mon total, she says, that Bulbasaur can be yours. We\u2019ve also spotted a wild Bulbasaur in Viridian Forest, which you travel through just before arriving in Pewter City, where your first gym battle is. But they\u2019re hard to come by in the grasses of that maze.Charmander is also available in Cerulean City. Run along the Nugget Bridge and defeat all the trainers along the way. Once on the other side, you\u2019ll see a trainer with a Charmander by their side. Show them that you\u2019ve caught 50 Pok\u00e9mon already, and they\u2019ll give you their Charmander to celebrate your achievement.Charmander can also sometimes be seen in the Rock Tunnel on the way to Lavender Town, making for a fantastic surprise.Squirtle requires the most Pok\u00e9mon in your collection to receive. Unlike the previous two, you\u2019ll have to leave Cerulean and go to Vermillion City, the next location on your journey, to find Squirtle. Officer Jenny has taken one into her custody for being a not-good boy. (Classic Squirtle!) But if you show Jenny that you\u2019ve caught 60 Pok\u00e9mon, she\u2019ll let you have the Squirtle for yourself.Squirtle also sometimes roams around routes 24 and 25. \n    Related\n  The best part of all of this is to qualify for the Pok\u00e9mon giveaways, you only need to have caught the necessary number of monsters overall \u2014 you don\u2019t need 60 unique Pok\u00e9mon for Squirtle, for instance. Combined with transferring Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon Go to Let\u2019s Go!, you can easily build an army of Charmander or whichever starter you like. We love Pikachu and Eevee, too, but something feels off about exploring Kanto without one of our trusty original starters with us. "}
