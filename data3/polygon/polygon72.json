{"id": "\u2018What the heck is The Nutcracker and the Four Realms?\u2019 and other burning questions, answered", "paragraph": "As Polygon\u2019s entertainment team geared up for our screening of The Nutcracker and the Four Realms \u2014 re-reading the Nutcracker story, rewatching the better Fantasia segments \u2014 we discovered that many of our co-workers had no idea what The Nutcracker and the Four Realms was all about.They had been struck, some might say dumb, by posters and trailers for Four Realms. They were intrigued by the combination of a 126-year-old ballet, stunt casting and the promise of a CGI extravaganza the likes of which only a modern Hollywood fantasy film can provide. We took down their questions and now provide you with the fruits \u2014 sugar plums, specifically \u2014 of our research. You might need it, too.Yes. Directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Joe Johnston, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is Walt Disney Studios\u2019 big holiday-themed release of the year, based on Tchaikovsky\u2019s The Nutcracker ballet. It stars Mackenzie Foy as Clara, Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Morgan Freeman as Drosselmeyer, Helen Mirren as Mother Ginger, Jayden Fowora-Knight as the Nutcracker and ballerina Misty Copeland as the Ballerina Princess. The movie runs around 99 minutes, which is around the length of a performance of the ballet. Faithful!Hallstr\u00f6m (What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape?, Chocolat) wrapped initial production in January of 2017. But almost a year later, in December 2017, Disney announced that Joe Johnston (Captain America: The First Avenger, The Rocketeer) would oversee a \u201csignificant shoot of additional photography\u201d based on new script material written by a new screenwriter, and lasting 32 days. There didn\u2019t seem to be any bad blood over the reshoots. Hallstr\u00f6m was unavailable to direct due to scheduling issues, and planned to oversee post-production. But enough changed that both men share a co-directing credit in the final billing.\n    Related\n  Originally, yes. Disney\u2019s upcoming live-action Mulan remake was scheduled to premiere on Nov. 2, but the company has since pushed the movie back more than a year, until March 27, 2020. In July 2018, Nutcracker took Mulan\u2019s former spot. Barely. Four Realms is about a young girl named Clara whose well-off London family \u2014 her father, older sister and younger brother \u2014 is struggling with getting through their first Christmas after the loss of Clara\u2019s mother. While attending a ball thrown by Clara\u2019s godfather, the genius clockwork engineer Drosselmeyer, Clara\u2019s search for the secret of her mother\u2019s last gift, a locked mechanical egg, leads her to discover four secret magical realms where she is a princess. She meets a Nutcracker, a Sugar Plum Fairy, a Mouse Prince and Mother Ginger. In The Nutcracker ballet, Clara is a young girl celebrating Christmas with her family, and her mysterious godfather, the toymaker Herr Drosselmeyer. Her adventure begins near midnight on Christmas Eve, when she watches her Christmas gift from Herr Drosselmeyer, a wooden nutcracker, come alive to battle the Mouse King, a fearsome multi-headed rodent. Clara saves the Nutcracker by hurling her slipper at the Mouse King, killing him. The defeat transforms the Nutcracker into his true form: a handsome prince. In gratitude, the Nutcracker takes Clara on a trip to his kingdom of candy people. That all happens in the first act, and the second act is a series of loosely \u201cinternational\u201d-themed dances, with regions of the world represented by different kinds of candy or food \u2014 chocolate for Spain, candy canes for Russia, etc.The Four Realms in Four Realms are a combination of references to the second act of The Nutcracker ballet and the Nutcracker segments that that appeared in Disney\u2019s 1940 animated film, Fantasia. The Realm of Candy and the evil Fourth Realm (spoiler: it\u2019s the \u201cRealm of Amusements\u201d) are references to Tchaikovsky\u2019s candy and clockwork toy motifs. The Realm of Flowers and the Realm of Snowflakes correspond to the animated flowers and snowflakes that visualized the music of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cRussian Dance,\u201d \u201cDance of the Flutes,\u201d and \u201cWaltz of the Flowers.\u201d The ballet version of \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d is based on a short story by Alexandre Dumas entitled \u201cThe Story of a Nutcracker,\u201d which in turn is based on E.T.A. Hoffmann\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker and the Mouse King,\u201d first published in 1812. In The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, the character of the Nutcracker shares a surname with Hoffmann (though it\u2019s spelled Hoffman in the film\u2019s promotional material). And in Hoffmann\u2019s original short story, the young girl in the lead was named Marie, though Dumas\u2019 version changed it to Clara. In Four Realms, Clara\u2019s mother is named Marie \u2014 a little nod to the original. To the first question: Not really. To the second question: Not at all. Characters don\u2019t sing in The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and while Tchaikovsky\u2019s Nutcracker orchestrations are recurring motifs, there\u2019s nearly as much original music in the soundtrack as there is Nutcracker melodies. Outside of Misty Copeland\u2019s two cameos, and a sequence during the end credits, there\u2019s barely even any dancing, let alone ballet. Sort of? The Mouse King is a giant pile of mice that forms the shape of a man-sized mouse, and is led by the Mouse Prince. What\u2019s really weird about the Mouse King is that it doesn\u2019t dance. At the company\u2019s D23 Expo in 2017, when the movie was still mid-production, Disney hyped up the participation of dancer Lil Buck. Buck has gained renown for performing the street dance style of jookin \u2014 characterized by smooth footwork and pantomiming \u2014 to classical music. At the time, Disney said that the production was using motion capture technology to capture Lil Buck\u2019s movements and create a \u201cstyle of dance that defines the character\u201d of the Mouse King. But in the final movie, the Mouse King doesn\u2019t dance. He just fights enemies and sometimes spooks the film\u2019s heroes, Clara and the Nutcracker. No. Despite how much The Nutcracker and the Four Realms seems tailored to reach the same audience as Tim Burton\u2019s Alice in Wonderland, it doesn\u2019t make any direct sequel setups, and it doesn\u2019t have an end or mid-credits scene. As far as the two Polygon staff members who have seen The Nutcracker and the Four Realms can remember, no nuts appear in The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. The movie\u2019s Nutcracker always appears as a living being, the same size as Clara. There is a bit where Clara\u2019s little brother receives a nutcracker for Christmas, but he does not crack any nuts with it during its brief appearance. "}
