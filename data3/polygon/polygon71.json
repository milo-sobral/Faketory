That seems like a good opportunity to knock out a few gift purchases.Also on sale this week is a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Ti graphics card for $349. Usually $499, Nvidia\u2019s older generation 10-series GPU is a solid piece of hardware. B&H is also throwing in a free PC download of Monster Hunter: World.
