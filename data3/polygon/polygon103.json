{"id": "Thronebreaker misses sales expectations because of GOG\u2019s small reach, says CD Projekt Red", "paragraph": "Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, was a sales disappointment for CD Projekt Red when it launched at the end of October on Windows PC, and the publisher suggested that original plans to launch exclusively on GOG.com \u2014 which CDPR owns \u2014 is to blame.In a financial call earlier this week, co-chief executive Adam Kicinski said CD Projekt Red had high expectations for sales based on community anticipation of the game, which took what had been planned as a small singleplayer campaign for Gwent: The Witcher Card Game and expanded it into a 30-hour standalone game.But to investors, Kicinski said \u201cthe reach of GOG is incomparably smaller than that of Steam,\u201d and so CDPR decided to launch there, too. Kicinski said \u201ca Steam release had always been considered,\u201d but the company originally announced that Thronebreaker would be exclusive to GOG.com for its Oct. 23 PC launch, a significant step for the Steam competitor. Thronebreaker was listed on Steam on Nov. 9.The sales may be a disappointment but that is no reflection on community or critical reception; Thronebreaker has a \u201cvery positive\u201d reputation among user reviews on Steam and GOG.com, and it\u2019s gotten praise from the games press.Whether this has ramifications for Cyberpunk 2077 and how CD Projekt Red will handle its launch, \u201cYou should not draw unwarranted conclusions concerning the future,\u201d Kicinski said. \u201cThronebreaker is a very unusual project from our perspective and it should not be viewed as a mold for other releases.\u201dThat goes for whether The Witcher Tales gets additional installments. \u201cOf course, depending on the results of Thronebreaker \u2014 I assume that it will continue to positively affect our bottom line; it is not, of course, a financial failure, it\u2019s just that our expectations are very high \u2014 these factors will be considered when making decisions regarding future releases of this type,\u201d Kicinski said, \u201cbut it\u2019s too early to provide any specifics.\u201dThronebreaker is due to launch Dec. 4 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One."}
