{"id": "This week\u2019s sexiest comic features Superman and Lois Lane renegotiating their marriage", "paragraph": "One of the first things writer Brian Michael Bendis did when he kicked off his run on the Superman titles, Superman and Action Comics, was to whisk Superman\u2019s wife and son off into space with no means of phoning home. Effectively, the Man of Steel was alone. But in the pages of Action Comics, Bendis has seeded hints that some of the superfamily were really not so far away after all. And this week, Bendis and artist Ryan Sook delivered the kind of scene that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily think would belong in a book with \u201caction\u201d in the title: Two adults sitting down to have an honest talk about the state of their marriage. And it includes one of the sexiest panels of Superman I\u2019ve ever read. The conversation begins when Superman finds Lois in the mundane earth city of Chicago, not in deep space, where he expected her to be. And, after reassuring her husband of the most pressing question between them \u2014 their son is fine, and still in space \u2014 they do what any loving couple would if they hadn\u2019t seen each other in a while. Lois went to space to chaperone the adventures of their half-Kryptonian son Jon with his grandfather \u2014 Clark\u2019s biological dad, Jor-El, who was recently revealed to have narrowly survived the destruction of Krypton. At the time, they weren\u2019t really sure if Jor-El was trustworthy. But once she got out there, Lois realized her presence as a baseline human was putting Jon and Jor-El in some danger in the inhospitable reaches of space. And for another thing: Jon is doing fine. Flourishing even. \u201cIt was the best thing that ever happened to him,\u201d she tells Clark. \u201cYour creepy father was right. Jon needed to get out there and Jon did not need me.\u201d Why is Lois back? She feels like her family has hit a turning point, where they can stop pretending they\u2019re a normal family \u2014 something the Kents did for most of Jon\u2019s childhood. And for the first time in a long time, Lois Lane, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist, can focus completely on her work. Clark has one response to that. Then they have sex again. It\u2019s canon: Superman is turned on by his wife doing Journalism. Still, Clark, a man raised on a farm by two loving and well-adjusted parents, protests the idea that he and Lois and Jon can\u2019t find a similar normalcy. And then he pauses, says, \u201cHold on...\u201d and superspeeds away to throw his costume on, stop a superhuman prison breakout, and superspeed back to being naked in their bed. It doesn\u2019t take much more pushing from Lois to get him to see her point of view. Jon\u2019s safe in space and coming into his own as a teen. Lois is going to research and write her book. Clark is going to \u201csave everything you can get your hands on.\u201d They can wholly devote themselves to the stuff that makes them them, and still be a family. And just in case anyone might still have some worries: Bendis and Sook\u2019s take on two partners \u2014 who just happen to be a superhero and his superhero-adjacent wife \u2014 renegotiating their family is exactly the kind of close character work that a reader will remember about a superhero story, even years later. Clark eagerly asks Lois when he\u2019ll get to read her new book, and Lois needles him for never learning to ride a bicycle (for obvious reasons). It\u2019s a serious scene that manages to be romantic, funny, heroic and sexy all at the same time \u2014 and it\u2019s a good reminder of why Lois Lane and Clark Kent aren\u2019t just the oldest romance in superhero comics. They\u2019re one of the best."}
