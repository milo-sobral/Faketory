{"id": "Media Molecule \u2018remakes\u2019 LittleBigPlanet with its next game, Dreams", "paragraph": "LittleBigPlanet, the PlayStation 3\u2019s first sortie into the player-created content genre, turned 10 a week ago (it launched Oct. 27, 2008). To celebrate, Media Molecule created the game\u2019s first stage in Dreams, the even more robust video game creator coming soon from the British studio.As you can see in the video, Dreams\u2019 rendition of The Gardens incorporates nearly every detail that makes LittleBigPlanet still familiar after 10 years \u2014 from the music, to Popit, the jumping physics and, of course, Sackboy.The conclusion of the level deviates to show off the 3D perspective that Dreams will allow; LittleBigPlanet was a 2.5D platformer, of course.Dreams has been in development for some time \u2014 officially announced back at E3 2015, with an anticipated beta pushed back several times. It was last mentioned in passing by Shawn Layden, the chairman of worldwide studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment, as on deck for a 2019 launch though no specific date is known.We went hands-on with Dreams over the summer and found its creation toolset formidably diverse, with the capability to make cutscenes and original soundtracks in addition to full 3D perspective games."}
