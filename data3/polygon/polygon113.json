{"id": "Devil May Cry animated series coming from Netflix Castlevania producer", "paragraph": "An animated series based on the Devil May Cry franchise is being developed by Adi Shankar, executive producer of the animated Castlevania series streaming on Netflix. Shankar revealed his next project to IGN.Shankar said that he has \u201cacquired these rights so [...] Hollywood [doesn\u2019t] fuck this up.\u201d It\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s a reference to the creative liberties that Hollywood studios have taken with other Capcom franchises, like Resident Evil and Monster Hunter.He also told IGN that his Devil May Cry series will \u201cjoin Castlevania in what we\u2019re now calling the bootleg multiverse.\u201d Shankar gained notoriety with a series of unauthorized, often graphically violent short films based on Marvel\u2019s Venom and The Punisher, Judge Dredd, and the Power Rangers. Those shorts existed as part of what Shankar called his \u201cbootleg universe.\u201d\u201cLet the speculation begin,\u201d he said, acknowledging that it\u2019s odd that Devil May Cry and Castlevania would somehow exist in a shared space, considering they\u2019re owned by two different companies. \u201cYou can read into that all you want.\u201dShankar has produced two seasons of Castlevania for Netflix, with a third season of the animated series recently confirmed. It\u2019s not clear yet where Devil May Cry will wind up, as Shankar tells Polygon he has \u201coffers from three streaming platforms\u201d and \u201cwill pick a home soon.\u201dCapcom has a new Devil May Cry game coming next year. Devil May Cry 5 is bound for PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One."}
