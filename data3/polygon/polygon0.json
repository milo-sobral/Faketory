{"id": "Fans go to town with Soulcalibur 6\u2019s fighter-creation tools", "paragraph": "Soulcalibur 6 launched yesterday and in the first 24 hours, naturally, someone used its character-creation toolkit to give Lizardman a huge pecker. But the \u201cCreate-a-Soul\u201d mode can still be a force for good! Players have also used it to pay tribute to some of the most beloved figures in pop culture. And Pepsiman.For example:Step aside, McCheese. There\u2019s a new mayor in McDonaldland:Actually, the most amazing thing about this creation tool is discovering that Bob Ross is a Ronald McDonald palette (GET IT?!) swap.This thread at ResetEra asked everyone to keep it SFW, so here\u2019s Doctor Strange, by Flousn.Who also did this take on Bowsette, naturally.And here\u2019s Rosalina, currently starring in Mario Tennis AcesThe list of funny user creations is growing hourly, so we will close things out with Pepsiman (as discovered by Altronage on Twitter)In summation, sure, user-generated content and customization tools will inevitably be used for malevolent purposes. Neanderthals drew dicks on cave walls, after all. But eventually humanity\u2019s instinct for artistic expression produced the Mona Lisa and Dogs Playing Poker. So, on the whole, Create-a-Soul\u2019s a good thing if people are having this much fun with it. Soulcalibur 6 is available now on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One."}
