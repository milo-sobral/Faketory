{"id": "The Detective Pikachu trailer is full of Pok\u00e9mon Easter eggs", "paragraph": "The Detective Pikachu trailer is here, and it\u2019s chock full of two things: ultra-realistic Pok\u00e9mon and tiny references to various parts of the series. From additional monsters, to regions and more, we\u2019ve rounded up the Easter eggs to keep an eye out for upon your umpteenth rewatch of the trailer. (And if you\u2019re looking for every Pok\u00e9mon in the trailer, we got you covered, too.)We\u2019re going to start with something attached to the trailer, but not in the trailer itself. The first official poster for Detective Pikachu has so many Easter eggs to pore over. Here\u2019s the list of what we\u2019ve noticed:Maybe \u201cbillboards\u201d isn\u2019t the right word, but in the first shot of the trailer, you can see big signs of the following Pok\u00e9mon: Victini, Wooper, Petilil, and, a little more obscured, Goomy. Gengar and Jigglypuff balloons can be seen in the next shot, seemingly ready to fly in a parade. On the ground alongside them are handlers dressed as Squirtle and Gengar, with a man dressed as Bulbasaur also walking into frame.Tim Goodman, the 21-year-old human lead of Detective Pikachu, is clearly a big Pok\u00e9mon fan. He\u2019s got a ton of posters from championship Pok\u00e9mon matches scattered across his room, including:Tim also has a headboard that looks like Pikachu\u2019s ears. This isn\u2019t an explicit reference to the Pok\u00e9mon universe, but it\u2019s my favorite sight gag in the trailer. The one-way ticket that Tim has to Ryme City, where most of Detective Pikachu takes place, lists his departure stop as Leaventown. Get it? He\u2019s leaving town \u2014 and that town is Leaventown. I love it. (There\u2019s also the idea that leaving references a big concept in Pok\u00e9mon: evolution, which is sure to be a key theme in the movie too.) The Unown alphabet is used occasionally in this trailer. We see the letter H on a sign among the bustling Ryme City nightlife, and Tim later wears a shirt with the letter O on it.When Jigglypuff makes its first appearance, there\u2019s another poster for a battle behind it. It\u2019s advertising a big match between a Machamp and a Primeape.Spot anything we may have missed? Drop it into the comments, and we\u2019ll be sure to add it to the post.Detective Pikachu is due in theaters May 11, 2019. "}
