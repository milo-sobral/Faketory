{"id": "Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack tucked away a new D\u2019Angelo song", "paragraph": "Red Dead Redemption had an impressive soundtrack \u2014 we\u2019re still fans of the theme \u201cCompass\u201d by Jamie Lidell \u2014 and Red Dead Redemption 2 is no different. Rockstar already confirmed that artists like Arca and a member of Queens of the Stone Age contributed to the tracklist, but there\u2019s at least one more musician who has snuck into the game without prior notice. That would be D\u2019Angelo, whose Black Messiah was one of the best albums of 2014. His career spans more than two decades, although he\u2019s as well known for his incisive R&B as his infrequent output. The song that shows up in Red Dead Redemption 2, \u201cMay I? Standing Unshaken \u2014 Oh Traveller Have a Seat,\u201d is his first new release since Black Messiah.Depending on how far into the game you are, you may have already heard it. The music-heads who picked up on the track say this plays in the fifth chapter, right between the missions \u201cParadise Mercifully Departed\u201d and \u201cDear Uncle Tacitus.\u201d Props to them for picking up on this \u2014 critic Craig Jenkins from New York magazine being one of the first \u2014 and sharing that with the rest of us. Guess it\u2019s time for us to brush up on our listening skills.Meanwhile, D\u2019Angelo, ever mysterious, has yet to comment."}
