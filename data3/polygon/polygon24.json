{"id": "Pok\u00e9mon Go players are finding this shiny Pok\u00e9mon all over the place", "paragraph": "The odds are against anyone trying to find a shiny Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 unless you\u2019re hoping for a shiny Shinx, a gen-four Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019s now in the game. Numerous players worldwide are sharing the sparkling Shinx they\u2019ve caught just days into its availability, a huge surprise about this otherwise hard-to-find Pok\u00e9mon.Shinx is an electric-type quadruped (and it\u2019s one of Sinnoh\u2019s cutest Pok\u00e9mon), appearing infrequently in Pok\u00e9mon Go thus far. It\u2019s most readily found in Raid Battles, along with the occasional 10-kilometer Egg. Wherever they\u2019re getting it from, people are surprised to see the Shinx they\u2019ve just captured as a bright-yellow cub, instead of the blue one it usually is. That a fourth-gen Pok\u00e9mon already has an obtainable shiny form is already a big deal, but the amount of people sharing their special finds is a particular surprise.OMG.. my all time favourite pokemon.. I got it in shiny, with awesome IV\u2018s   couldnt wish for more, absolutely grateful! #shiny #shinx #luxray #Gen4 #barefoot pic.twitter.com/yvaktVTmFAWHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?!SHINY SHINX IS AVAILABLE IN RAIDS?!DUDE, LUXRAY IS MY FAVORITE GEN 4 POK\u00c9MON I'M HELLA HYPE!!!#PokemonGO (sorry for the caps but NOT REALLY, IM HYPE WTF!) pic.twitter.com/m6HwPCUyOiI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be back to playing pokemon go yet here I am 2 years later, losing my shit because I just hatched a Shiny Shinx. pic.twitter.com/xzTe5fPowTThe bad news is that Raid Battles featuring Shinx can be hard to come by. The Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t yet available in the wild, so the most anyone can do is cross their fingers and check out as many gyms in the area as possible. It\u2019s a first-tier Raid Battle boss at that, which is the least exciting type for players. The odds of finding a Shinx at all don\u2019t seem great, as members of The Silph Road are pointing out. \u201cThe number of Shinx raids you\u2019d have to hit to have a good chance of getting a shiny is pretty ridiculous,\u201d wrote one Redditor. \u201cI think you usually want to double or triple the 450 number [the traditional shiny-Pok\u00e9mon odds] before you can reasonably say \u2018I should have this by now.\u2019 Hitting near 1000 Shinx raids when it\u2019s not even the only thing that can come out of T1 eggs would be a very difficult if not impossible feat.\u201dAll that said, it\u2019s surprising to see so many people still manage to find shiny Shinx after only a few Raid Battles. And some players think that Niantic may have boosted the rates at which you can find a Shinx Raid \u2014 and, better yet, a shiny Shinx."}
