{"id": "Why Shovel Knight was the right game at the right time", "paragraph": "The following excerpt comes from the book Shovel Knight, available now from publisher Boss Fight Books. Based around interviews with development studio Yacht Club Games, the book looks at the making of the team\u2019s debut game \u2014 Shovel Knight \u2014 and how the studio turned its Kickstarter success into one of the most critically acclaimed indie games to date.Shovel Knight served as a vessel for the spirit of 8-bit gaming from the halcyon days when the NES reigned supreme in millions of living rooms. That spirit moved Dan Adelman. A graduate of Columbia University, Adelman spent four years at Microsoft helping to lay groundwork for the business side of the Windows publisher\u2019s original Xbox console before joining Nintendo of America as head of digital content and development in November 2005. \u201cWhen I joined Nintendo, there were already some plans for digitally distributing the classic NES, SNES and N64 titles via Virtual Console, but there was no strategy for how to expand digital distribution to include new games,\u201d he said.Adelman saw potential in courting smaller teams. At the time he joined Nintendo, however, he was something of an iconoclast. Rising costs made established studios such as Nintendo hesitant to branch out and experiment with bold, new designs. Adelman was keen to experiment. He connected with studios interested in publishing small-scale games on a small-scale budget. \u201cWiiWare was the first digital distribution service I kicked off and ran at Nintendo,\u201d he said. \u201cLater iterations and improvements on the digital distribution service were DSiWare for the Nintendo DSi, and the 3DS and Wii U eShops.\u201dWiiWare, the flip side to Virtual Console\u2019s golden oldies, was made up of brand-new games created by teams large and small. Published in 2008, World of Goo is a 2D puzzle game where players build contraptions by sticking pieces and parts together using wads of goop. Adelman saw the game\u2019s potential and brought the four-person team into the Nintendo fold to release World of Goo on Wii. That same year, Capcom announced Mega Man 9, which satisfied Nintendo\u2019s goal of working with safe, known quantities.Adelman persuaded the powers that be at Nintendo that they needed to approach independent developers differently than big-budget studios like Capcom. Many individuals inside Nintendo\u2019s ranks saw little difference between Capcom and, later on, Yacht Club Games. They believed that all publishers should be held to the same standards, rates, and sales expectations. Adelman disagreed. To him, while all titles should hit certain quality markers, a four- or five-person team developing a game for a $15 to $20 price point shouldn\u2019t be expected to hit the lofty sales goals \u2014 usually one million units sold or more \u2014 of big publishing houses that put out games with $50 or $60 price tags to justify development expenses in the tens or hundreds of millions. To Adelman, indies represented a sort of proving ground. Smaller teams could build games that cost exponentially less to fund, and that would catch the eye of players in the market for games at lower prices. Nintendo became more willing to work with indie developers as support from monolithic third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts and Activision turned their noses up at the Wii U\u2019s underpowered hardware and stagnant sales. \u201cA lot of third-party publisher support had dried up,\u201d Adelman recalled of the Wii U\u2019s lifespan between 2012 and 2017, \u201cso the indie developers were keeping that system going for a while. I think many at Nintendo were grateful for that support.\u201dAdelman had met Yacht Club\u2019s co-founders when he had entered into a publishing relationship to license WayForward\u2019s games for distribution on WiiWare. \u201cThey were working on a very creative title called LIT, which was a survival horror puzzle game that used the Wii Remote as a flashlight,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cThey were often a go-to partner, since they always delivered innovative and well-designed games.\u201dShortly before kicking off their Kickstarter in early 2013, Yacht Club\u2019s Sean Velasco phoned Adelman and brought him up to speed on their plans. \u201cWe were announcing this at the beginning of 2013,\u201d Yacht Club\u2019s David D\u2019Angelo said. \u201cPS4 and Xbox One hadn\u2019t been announced yet, and we didn\u2019t know if people would still be buying games for PS3 and Xbox 360. 3DS was at its height at the time, and we\u2019d all got WiiUs and were excited about that.\u201dAdelman set up a meeting to see Shovel Knight. Although the game was still embryonic, he saw its potential right away. \u201cI respond well to tight, precise controls, so I think that was the first thing I noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s underappreciated and so hard to get right, yet it makes all the difference. I also loved how authentically retro they were able to make the game, from the fonts they used to the color palette.\u201dAdelman demonstrated his support by clearing one major hurdle from Yacht Club\u2019s road to publication. \u201cWe got our hands on Wii U and 3DS kits as loaners for a year or two, then we\u2019d have to give them back,\u201d Velasco said. \u201cBut during that time they were free. That was enormous for us because we had no money.\u201d\u201cSince I was familiar with Sean from his WayForward days and knew he was a great game developer, I was able to expedite their approval process,\u201d Adelman said. \u201cBut beyond that, there wasn\u2019t much development support they needed from me. They knew what they were doing.\u201dYacht Club\u2019s Kickstarter went live on March 13, 2013, with a target of $75,000. With nine days to go before PAX, nervousness crept in. Their demo, a full stage from the game, remained unfinished. They had divided their time between generating content for the demo and putting together their crowdfunding campaign. \u201cIt was crazy, man,\u201d Velasco said. \u201cIt was a lot of work. I remember thinking, even a week before PAX, Well, maybe we won\u2019t be able to get the demo done and we\u2019ll just have our banner there, and some beanbags, and Super Mario 64, and we\u2019ll just play it and tell people about the game even though there\u2019s no game to play. Just shoot the shit. Fortunately we were able to get it all done.\u201dSetting up their booth at PAX East, the guys watched as Shannon Hatakeda, a friend from WayForward who later joined Yacht Club Games as project manager, picked up a controller and began to play. The demo, finished in the nick of time, took place in King Knight\u2019s stage, a gilded castle bedecked in lavish corridors, bottomless pits, and \u2014 in another nod to Mega Man \u2014 platforms that disappeared and reappeared at set intervals. Velasco chewed his lip, watching to see where Hatakeda got stuck. At the end, she put down the controller and announced that Shovel Knight was fun. Really fun. The team let out a breath. The group\u2019s confidence increased once the show got underway. Visitors streamed into their booth and raved about the game. Articles on websites such as Destructoid and Kotaku extolled its tight controls and throwback visuals.\u201cA big part of it was that we came out right around the time when Capcom was ignoring Mega Man,\u201d D\u2019Angelo said.Three years had passed since Mega Man 10\u2019s release on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii. Long-time series producer and artist Keiji Inafune had been leading the design of Mega Man Universe, a sidescrolling game where players would be able to build levels and modify characters, before he left Capcom in October 2010. The company quietly cancelled the game early in 2011 for \u201cvarious reasons.\u201d Mega Man Legends 3, the next installment in the 3D branch of the Blue Bomber\u2019s family tree, had been announced in the fall of 2010, only to be shelved the next year, ostensibly due to low fan interest.\u201cEveryone was saying, \u2018There will never be a Mega Man game again. I\u2019m so sad,\u2019\u201d D\u2019Angelo said. \u201cAnd then here we come storming in with this game that feels much like a Mega Man experience.\u201dYacht Club\u2019s campaign oozed 8-bit charm and rekindled veteran players\u2019 nostalgia. Rather than reveal all their information on day one, the team unwrapped their Kickstarter over the month-long period. Every week brought exciting reveals such as silhouettes of the Order of No Quarter, the bosses players would face in the game.\u201cWhat\u2019s the coolest part of [a new] Mega Man [game]? The eight new Robot Masters,\u201d Velasco said. He, like many players from the NES era, had fond childhood memories of daydreaming about the next game\u2019s bosses. \u201cWhat will they look like? What are their levels going to be like? We decided to do reveals of all of our knights throughout the Kickstarter campaign [because] that would be exciting.\u201dNearly as much work goes into crafting a character\u2019s silhouette as goes into creating the character. \u201cWhen people talked about them, they could point to them and say, \u2018That\u2019s obviously an anchor sticking out of his arm. I wonder what he is,\u2019\u201d said Yacht Club artist Nick Wozniak, \u201cor, \u2018That tall, weird one that has a scythe \u2014 I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a reaper.\u2019 Designing a knight is as much about their personality as how they fit with everybody else.\u201dYacht Club gained support by targeting retro games from a specific time and platform. By the time Shovel Knight broke ground on Kickstarter, indie games boasting old-school trappings like pixel art, chiptune soundtracks and 2D platforming were sprouting like weeds. Shovel Knight stood apart from the pack. \u201cFirst of all, it feels like an NES game,\u201d Velasco said of why fans embraced Shovel Knight so quickly. \u201cGames like Fez and Rogue Legacy look [and feel] like indie games. That\u2019s a whole other thing.\u201d Fez and Rogue Legacy in particular look like they could have been published on other consoles, like Sony\u2019s inaugural PlayStation. Their art style, while charming, casts a wide net, appealing to a general sort of nostalgia. Shovel Knight\u2019s art style evokes Nintendo\u2019s 8-bit console in myriad ways. The trailer opens with Yacht Club Games spelled out in a pixelated font based on lettering that Japanese publisher Taito had used in dozens of classic coin-op and NES titles. Reading character dialogue in the Shovel Knight trailer transported players back to the days when blocky letters had unspooled across their equally blocky television sets.\u201cNostalgia works well on Kickstarter because it\u2019s something you can immediately understand,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo. \u201cThey still make Mario and Rayman [games], but there\u2019s nothing new there. The idea of seeing a new IP where the character is the name of the game was a cool thing to see. Being able to draw on the feelings people had when they were eight years old worked for the Kickstarter [backers].\u201dFurthermore, Shovel Knight\u2019s Kickstarter served as an extension of the personalities of its creators. Yacht Club\u2019s quintet were fun-loving and irreverent. They enjoyed satire, puns, alliterations and poking fun at the industry they loved. Along with premium goods such as a soundtrack and an art book for backers who pledged at or above a certain level, they offered an even more decadent prize: a bag of dirt. \u201cWe sold it for a hundred bucks,\u201d said Woz, laughing. \u201cWe tried to figure out what this dirt would be because we were afraid of shipping bioorganic material across the world, so we didn\u2019t want to use potting soil. We eventually got some generic, neutral sand, but we added stuff into it.\u201dEach bag\u2019s \u201cstuff\u201d was unique to a particular knight from the Order of No Quarter. \u201cWe added tiny little bones for Specter Knight\u2019s dirt,\u201d Woz said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a damned village, so we put in little bones and these skull things. We put that in a nice envelope, plus a little note from us describing the village, so you got a little taste of the world in real life. It sold out. We had to make more so people could keep buying it.\u201dShovel Knight\u2019s campaign ended on April 13. Velasco and the others stared at their monitors through bleary eyes. Between Kickstarter pledges and PayPal donations, they had raised $328,682. They stared at one another. Shovel Knight was happening, and they had over 15,000 people to thank for it. \u201cTo know that people were ready to get on board from the beginning was exciting,\u201d D\u2019Angelo said. \u201cNormally when you make a game, it\u2019s a secret for around 12 months, and it\u2019s lonely and sad. To know that people are with you every step of the way was really fun.\u201dOnce the Kickstarter funds came through, the team put their previously agreed-upon plans into motion. Each developer received their stipend. The rest was earmarked for future expenses. \u201cWe took a block of it and put it away so we couldn\u2019t touch it because it was for Kickstarter rewards, or game codes [for press to review] t-shirts, and things like that,\u201d Yacht Club\u2019s Ian Flood said.In May, Yacht Club traded Velasco\u2019s cramped apartment for a proper work setting. \u201cOnce that money came in, we said, \u2018OK, we want to lead real lives now. Let\u2019s get a tiny, crappy office,\u2019\u201d said D\u2019Angelo.Bare, windowless walls bordered three rooms covered in green carpet. The main room \u2014 the largest, yet still cramped \u2014 became a bullpen for desks and equipment. A testing station took up an adjoining room. The third room was designated as a storage closet and, later, a repository for swag like posters and action figures. The walls didn\u2019t stay bare for long. A Mega Man 9 poster went up on one. On another, a framed portrait of Star Wars creator George Lucas garbed in full military regalia watched over the team in the bullpen. Lucas\u2019s portrait doubled as a shrine: Any time a business deal had to be conducted, they looked to Lucas, whom they dubbed the patron saint of shilling for his notorious ability to milk his intellectual properties dry.The team gave little thought to d\u00e9cor. They had a game to make.\u201cWe got emails as soon as we launched the Kickstarter that were like, \u2018Why is this going to take so long? It looks like it\u2019s already done,\u2019\u201d Velasco said. \u201cThe fact of the matter was that what you saw in the Kickstarter video and what you saw at PAX was all we had. That was everything we had.\u201d "}
