{"id": "Every live-action Pok\u00e9mon in the Detective Pikachu trailer ", "paragraph": "Detective Pikachu is bringing Pok\u00e9mon to the real world for the very first time. While we can all enjoy the AR camera in Pok\u00e9mon Go and the 2016 Pok\u00e9mon Super Bowl commercial, this is the first-ever feature-length, live-action Pok\u00e9mon movie. And it\u2019s not just Pikachu getting the live-action treatment \u2014 Pok\u00e9mon from all generations appear in this trailer.Here\u2019s what we spotted: The opening scene gives us fast glances at a bunch of Pokemon in the area. Right away, we know we\u2019re in the Pokemon world, and it is chockfull of Pok\u00e9mon. We see a Comfey floating among some of the Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 in the very beginning of this scene, as well as Fearow in the air and Braviary on the ground. Walking along the street, we spy a Dodrio and a wee little Charmander in the bottom-left corner. There\u2019s also a Bouffalant lurking in the crowd.Read nextThe first Pok\u00e9mon in focus is this Psyduck plodding alongside the lead female character Lucy (Kathryn Newton), a junior reporter following her first big story. There\u2019s no actual Gengar senn in the trailer, but a parade balloon in the shape of one can be seen in a background shot. There\u2019s also a Jigglypuff balloon, fitting for the \u201cBalloon Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d Is there a celebratory Pok\u00e9-parade in this world? Does it have to do with Thanksgiving at all? Here\u2019s another, closer picture of the Psyduck later on in the trailer \u2014 check out those eyes! That bill! Ah yes, there he is. The Pok\u00e9mon of the hour: Detective Pikachu in all his furry glory. Voiced by Ryan Reynolds, this Pikachu\u2019s more about crime-solving than battling, relying on his wits and deductive reasoning to get the job done. A group of Emolga can be seen clustered on top of the food stalls towards the left in this crowded market. You can also see an Audino towards the right. (And in the middle of the crowd, three distinct Dodrio heads peep out towards the back again.)A collection of posters shows a missing Squritle and Pancham. What happened to them?!This lovely pastoral scene shows our heroes Tim and Detective Pikachu following a herd of Bulbasaur crossing a river, as some Morelull drift around them. How picturesque! An angry Jigglypuff stands on top of a table in what looks like a dingy little diner, and it\u2019s definitely ready to throw down after being interrupted from its singing. We\u2019ve learned from the anime: Don\u2019t you dare interrupt Jigglypuff once it starts to sing. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it. In the background of the Jigglypuff scene, we can see a poster on the left advertising some sort of showdown between these two fighting types. It\u2019s big! It\u2019s scaly! It\u2019s Charizard fighting in some sort of battle arena! While the quick glimpses we got of Charmander didn\u2019t really show off its scales, we can definitely see the reptilian features in the Charizard. The close-up especially shows off the scales on this big fella. A group of Greninja attacks, slashing their slimy fingers across the camera. Catch a look at their long tongue scarves! Greninja, it appears, travel in packs and ambush unsuspecting passerby. This crowd \u2014 presumably watching a Poke\u00e9mon match \u2014 has a Rufflet toward the left and a Squirtle standing on something toward the right. Mr. Mime is already one of the more ... peculiar of the Pok\u00e9mon designs. Seeing it rendered in live-action is a particularly peculiar experience. We never realized its shoulder-ball-things were so textured. Its eyes! The wrinkles around its eyes! There\u2019s a lot of Mr. Mime happening. See any Pok\u00e9mon in the trailer that we missed? Point \u2019em out in the comments for some good ol\u2019 Pok\u00e9-spotting! Detective Pikachu comes out on May 11, 2019."}
