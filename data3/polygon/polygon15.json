{"id": "Black Ops 4\u2019s Black Market is now available on PS4, PC and Xbox One to follow next week", "paragraph": "The Black Market, the cosmetic marketplace for Call of Duty, is now live in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 on PlayStation 4 and will be live on PC and Xbox One on Oct. 26, developer Treyarch announced on Friday morning.At launch, the only Black Market feature that is turned on is the Contraband stream, a progression system that allows players to unlock new cosmetic content \u2014 such as new Blackout characters, weapon skins, specialist outfits, tags and gestures \u2014 simply by playing the game. Much like Fortnite\u2019s Battle Pass, the Contraband stream will award players loot for earning in-game experience. Each new set of unlocks will be called an Operation and will rotate on a seasonal basis, with new rewards every few months. The Black Market will also feature special events that only stick around for a short time. The first of these events will begin Oct. 20 for PS4 players \u2014 with other platforms following a week later \u2014 and will feature special Halloween-themed unlocks. These will only be available for a short time, but there will be more events in the future, according to Treyarch. The final addition to the game\u2019s Black Market is Blackjack\u2019s Shop. Here, players will be able to purchase specific cosmetic pieces that will only be available for a week at a time. Blackjack\u2019s Shop will go live in Black Ops 4 sometime in November."}
