{"id": "Warcraft 3: Reforged is more than just a remaster of Blizzard\u2019s classic RTS", "paragraph": "Blizzard describes Warcraft 3: Reforged as a \u201ccomplete reimagining\u201d of its real-time strategy classic, which is probably the best way of explaining what it\u2019s doing with the 16-year-old game. Part remaster, part rebalancing, part retcon, Reforged will be a major upgrade for the game that won\u2019t leave players of the original behind.During an interview at BlizzCon 2018, Blizzard\u2019s Brian Souza and Pete Stillwell explained that players who own the original Warcraft 3 will be able to play against those who own Warcraft 3: Reforged, and vice versa. Maps and other community created content made in the original Warcraft 3 are also compatible with Reforged. Stillwell, senior producer on Warcraft 3: Reforged, said that from a technical standpoint, the two versions of the game will live under one client to achieve that compatibility.Warcraft 3: Reforged was developed with a different goal in mind than last year\u2019s StarCraft: Remastered, Stillwell said.\u201cWhen we went to Korea [for StarCraft: Remastered] and talked with pros and people still playing in game rooms, the overwhelming feedback was \u2018Please don\u2019t change the game,\u2019\u201d Stillwell said. \u201c\u2018Make it pretty, give us a modern matchmaker and then quietly step away, Blizzard.\u2019 Getting those marching orders made the endeavor not just easier but more focused. But with [Warcraft 3: Reforged], we\u2019ve talked with the communities in Europe and in China [who say], \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t think this game is done.\u2019\u201dThe goal is not just to give Warcraft 3 a new coat of paint, but \u201cdo more with it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s push it,\u201d Stillwell said. \u201cLet\u2019s get it to be as perfectly balanced as StarCraft. Let\u2019s add more to the editor, because it\u2019s already powerful. And like a good Blizzard game, it\u2019s easy to learn, difficult to master, [but let\u2019s] also make it even deeper.\u201dThere is rebalancing in the works for Warcraft 3: Reforged, \u201chundreds of balance changes to heroes, units and buildings\u201d to modernize the game, Blizzard says. And those changes will go back into the original Warcraft 3, which Blizzard has been updating over the past year in preparation for Reforged.Blizzard is also promising to \u201creforge\u201d the game\u2019s cinematic cutscenes, and will tweak portions of the game to fall in line with the past decade and a half of lore established by World of Warcraft.Writer Christie Golden, who has worked with Blizzard on multiple novels set in the Warcraft universe over the past two decades, is helping to bring \u201cparity\u201d to the stories of Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft, which will require retconning some of the strategy game\u2019s story. Those changes will bring \u201crenewed focus to a few central characters that we thought deserved a little bit more time in the limelight,\u201d Stillwell said.\u201cThere\u2019s been 16 years of evolution of this franchise outside of this game,\u201d Stillwell explained. \u201cSome of that, especially central characters like Jaina and Sylvanas, these people who mean so much more to the world now who didn\u2019t get as much focus [in the original Warcraft 3] because we just didn\u2019t know where they were going to be.\u201dThere will also be updates to Warcraft 3\u2019s world layout and locations ... and even its Murlocs.\u201cThe missions themselves, like what you see in \u2018The Culling,\u2019 we didn\u2019t just replace the artwork, we relayed it out to be what people expect from World of Warcraft,\u201d Souza, a lead artist on Reforged, said. \u201c[Players have] gone through Stratholme while it\u2019s burning. They\u2019ve gone through Stratholme with Arthas as he\u2019s doing the Culling, and that\u2019s one of those things where we\u2019re recreating the [Stratholme] that people know, rather than one that was in the original Warcraft 3, which if you looked at it really didn\u2019t make much sense \u2014 it had Greek columns, and these whale statues and this river going through it. So where we can make those changes where it brings parity with World of Warcraft which has done so much with the characters, with the lore, and the locations...\u201d\u201cAnd a lot of stuff in Warcraft 3 was just kind of put in as \u2018Hey, isn\u2019t this awesome? This is cool.\u2019 Like the Murlocs for instance. One of the artists back in the day, he came in over the weekend because he felt that there needed to be more creeps on the maps ... so he just retextured what the ghoul was and he made a Murloc. That was how the Murloc was born. Just this guy [being] really passionate wanting more stuff. Then in World of Warcraft, Murlocs are everywhere \u2014 they\u2019ve gotten a society, they\u2019ve got heroes \u2014 so we want to make sure that [Reforged\u2019s] Murlocs, are those Murlocs.\u201dWarcraft 3: Reforged will be released for Mac and Windows PC in 2019."}
