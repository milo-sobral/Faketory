{"id": "Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie delayed, new \u2018AAA\u2019 game in the works", "paragraph": "Scott Cawthon\u2019s Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s series shows no signs of slowing down, with a feature film, a new sequel, updated console ports and a new \u201cbig-budget game\u201d in development. Cawthon outlined the future for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s on Steam earlier today, starting with the bad news: The movie based on the horror games has been delayed (even though it didn\u2019t have an announced release date).Earlier this year, Blumhouse Productions announced that it was developing a live-action Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie with director Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone) at the helm. But Cawthon said that this movie will take a little longer to complete, as he\u2019s thrown out his original script.\u201cI had a script written,\u201d Cawthon said. \u201cJason [Blum] liked it, and Chris Columbus liked it too, but I tossed it. I had a different idea for it, one that I liked better. I take responsibility for this delay; it\u2019s my fault.\u201dCawthon said he\u2019s \u201cdetermined to find the right story,\u201d which has been a challenge. He\u2019s focusing on the story told during the first three Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s games for his movie script.\u201cI\u2019m sticking to what I\u2019ve always said, either the right movie gets made or no movie gets made,\u201d Cawthon explained. \u201cI hate delaying a project that\u2019s already seen so many delays, but I have to go with my instincts on what I think will be exciting and interesting, and what I think the fanbase will really want to see. If that means that I have to start over ten more times, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. The good thing is that each attempt gets better and better, in my opinion. So, despite the delays, it\u2019s going in the right direction.\u201dOn the gaming side of things, Cawthon said that there are virtual reality and augmented reality games based on Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s in development, as well as \u201cnew, improved, HD ports of all of the original games\u201d for Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.There\u2019s also a \u201cAAA\u201d game based on the series, although it\u2019s said to be very early in development.\u201cThere is a BIG deal in the works to create an incredible big-budget game!\u201d Cawthon said. \u201cI can\u2019t reveal any details yet as this project is still in its planning stages, but I\u2019m working closely with the studio involved to ensure that it delivers what (I think) FNAF fans will want to see!\u201dThe most recent game in the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s series, Ultimate Custom Night, was released in June. Cawthon describes the game as \u201cthe ultimate FNAF mashup,\u201d with more than 50 selectable characters and custom difficulties."}
