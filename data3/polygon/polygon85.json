{"id": "Marvel Comics remembers Stan Lee\u2019s legacy ", "paragraph": "On Monday, comic icon Stan Lee passed away at age 95. His influence across comics and entertainment spread far and wide, but it was at Marvel that he built his career and reputation. The company released a touching obituary on its site to honor Lee\u2019s legacy. Lee\u2019s work as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel produced some of the most iconic superheroes that we know today. \u201cA rich collection of characters grew out of his nonstop plotting sessions with his artists, including the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more,\u201d Marvel\u2019s obituary reads. \u201cToday, it would be almost impossible to find a corner of the Marvel Universe that Stan didn\u2019t have a hand in.\u201dBut Lee did more than just create the world of Marvel comics; he also directly spoke to the readers, creating a personal touch that hadn\u2019t been seen before. \u201cWhen something mattered to Stan, you felt it in his words, whether in an editorial or in the stories themselves,\u201d Marvel continued in the statement. \u201cWith passion for the medium, he helped refine and reform the Comics Code Authority and addressed hot-button issues like discrimination, drugs, and intolerance.\u201dThe full statement can be read on Marvel\u2019s site. Above it all is an image of \u201cSmiling Stan\u201d Lee, with one of his most notable quotes.\u201cI used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers. And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people\u2019s lives. Without it, they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you\u2019re able to entertain, you\u2019re doing a good thing.\u201d"}
