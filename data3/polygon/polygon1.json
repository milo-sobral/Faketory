{"id": "Am I the only one who cares that Days Gone was delayed again?", "paragraph": "Look, I just want my motorcycle gang video game, alright?I was hard pressed to find any sympathy yesterday when Sony said Days Gone was delayed another two months, now launching in April 2019. The game, under development since 2015 by Sony\u2019s Bend, Oregon studio and announced at E3 2016, is a rather straightforward pitch \u2014 The Last of Us meets Sons of Anarchy, right? Who doesn\u2019t like that? Boom, I just made you a million dollars. Yet it took forever to get a launch window and has been delayed twice now. The latest delay is probably just to get it out of the way of bigger premieres like Crackdown 3 and Anthem in late February.Dammit, I\u2019m a paunchy, 45-year-old man with toilet-seat pattern baldness and the clock is ticking here. I\u2019m going to have my first polyp removed before a proper motorcycle gang video game comes out on consoles. Every mid-life crisis trigger I\u2019ve had I can self-medicate with a video game, except this one. Sports cars? Forza Horizon. Rugged exceptionalism? Red Dead Redemption 2 is out next week. College glories? Listen, not only did I create myself as a superstar quarterback in NCAA Football 13, I created myself as a coach to recruit myself.Yet somehow, the most toxically masculine fantasy of the consumer demographic with the most disposable income \u2014 i.e. paunchy 45-year-old men with toilet-seat pattern baldness \u2014 can\u2019t find big time in a video game if you gave it a shovel and a map. Full Throttle was lovely but that was a point-and-click adventure that came out almost a quarter-century ago. Grand Theft Auto 4: The Lost and The Damned is a decent biker story, but that\u2019s an expansion to the larger game. And then there\u2019s Ride to Hell: Retribution, which is the only video game ever that a GameStop clerk tried to convince me not to pre-order. (He actually said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d) Ride to Hell was announced in 2008, launched in 2013 and played like development stopped in 2010. It had sex scenes with people wearing pants (SFW), like a Cinemax movie from 1989. But it had a great theme song.Sons of Anarchy itself \u2014 whose Mayans M.C. spinoff premiered on FX in September and just got renewed for a second season \u2014 got into a deal for a video game adaptation. Creator Kurt Sutter promised he wouldn\u2019t go in on \u201csome slapcrap browser thing.\u201d Instead it was a slapcrap mobile game. Ten episodes were planned for Sons of Anarchy: The Prospect. The game only delivered one, was removed from mobile marketplaces and its makers granted refunds to those who\u2019d signed up for the rest.In other words, the bar here is incredibly low. If I was a video game, I would kill to have that kind of an emotional reference group. (That\u2019s a term your therapist will use when you\u2019re my age.) All you have to do is show up, Days Gone. You\u2019re a PlayStation 4 exclusive. You\u2019ve got everything in the world going for you. Why aren\u2019t you happy?"}
