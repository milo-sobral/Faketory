{"id": "Halloween director David Gordon Green on pushing Michael Myers\u2019 horrors to the limit", "paragraph": "The spine-tingling idea for the new Halloween only seems obvious in retrospect: Circle back to Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019 Laurie Strode 40 years later, treat the masked killer Michael Myers like one of America\u2019s incarcerated \u201ctrue crime\u201d icons, witness another episode of slasher horror through the lens of generational trauma, and resurrect the style of John Carpenter\u2019s original film \u2014 ice-cold and home-movie gritty \u2014 for a new generation. For David Gordon Green, the concept was a hunch and gamble, but most of his movies have been. After entering the filmmaking fray with a string of critically acclaimed indies (2000\u2019s George Washington, 2003\u2019s All the Real Girls and 2004\u2019s Undertow), he teamed with Seth Rogen for Pineapple Express, spoofed \u201980s fantasy with Your Highness, returned to his indie roots for Prince Avalanche and the Nicolas Cage-led Joe, then became the guy who could shepherd A-list actors \u2014 Sandra Bullock in Our Brand Is Crisis and Jake Gyllenhaal in last year\u2019s Stronger \u2014 in prestige performances. He\u2019s a director who makes the pieces fit and adapts his stylistic instincts to the genre sandbox. Dying to do a horror movie, Halloween became the high-stakes IP puzzle he was more than ready to crack.Polygon had a chance to talk to Green, who despite playing the Hollywood game, still gushes about making movies through a laid-back Texas drawl. Here, the director and co-writer talks about taking on the job, Halloween\u2019s one-shot murder streak sequence that defines his vision, and whether he\u2019d come back for more.  [Ed. note: this interview contains mild spoilers for Halloween.]Before we get to Halloween: You were going to direct the Suspiria remake, which now opens a week after your movie. What happened? David Gordon Green: It\u2019s going to be awesome if the previews are any indication. I wrote a draft of it and was going to direct it and that and developed that with Luca Guadagnino for awhile. Luca was going to produce it for me and then \u2026 that didn\u2019t happen. My career is so bizarre. When I\u2019m asking people to invest in my films, sometimes they don\u2019t really understand what I\u2019m trying to do because I haven\u2019t developed that kind of signature filmmaker move. I don\u2019t have that thing that you did. I say, \u201cHey, I make serial killer movies\u201d or \u201cI make broad comedies\u201d or whatever the genre might be that could help me solidify a little bit more stability and people investing in me. Did you chase Halloween because you had the itch to make a horror movie?Green: This was an opportunity. I\u2019d known Jason [Blum] for a long time, and I brought him some ideas for horror movies that I could make after Suspiria fell through. We talked about certain things and we never really found something that gelled. Then I got an email from him that just said \u201cHalloween?\u201d It was like a psychic premonition I had. You could interpret a vague email like that in infinite ways, but I knew what it meant and I knew that I was going to do it. I had great confidence in it. When there\u2019s someone with the power that [Jason] has, and the entity that he\u2019s created right now [in Blumhouse Productions], it\u2019s literally just a matter of him saying yes. So it\u2019s not a big committee, it\u2019s not a huge legacy property burdened with a massive machine behind it. It\u2019s Malek Akkad and Jason Blum and Bill Block, the producers, [are in charge of the Halloween IP]. And they just said, \u201cLet\u2019s go make a movie.\u201dWhat scene in the movie signifies what you hoped to get out of returning to the vibe of the original movie? Green: I think Michael going door to door. The senseless killing of it, the randomness of it, the trick-or-treat of it all. To me I wanted that signature scene to be something that we\u2019d rehearsed and put a lot of thought and time and into, and use it to define what was specific about our movie. Strangely, in Halloween II, there\u2019s a woman that he looks at it through a window and she\u2019s cutting a sandwich. So we kind of alluded to that and then we fulfilled that evening\u2019s quest a little bit more graphically and thoroughly than they did in Halloween II. That sequence says here we are honoring the thoroughness of the original film. We\u2019re in some ways showing how we separate ourselves from Halloween II and beyond. Is the movie ripe with other nods to the less distinguished sequels?Green: Not really. There are some trick-or-treaters wearing masks from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. There are some subtle things. The art department on this movie, Richard Wright, our production designer, is a huge fan of all the later ones \u2014 he knows them more scientifically than I do. I know there\u2019s a lot that I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on because he just would like try to surprise me and then tell me later. Some of the details like the ice machine at a gas station or something I had no clue of. Then he points out it\u2019s something from Halloween 5. That\u2019s probably an incorrect example [laughs]. But the team set out to do that and have fun with that. \n    Related\n  So you kill a kid in this movie.Green: [laughs] I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a kid \u2026 he\u2019s armed!OK, he\u2019s a teen. You kill a teen. And at one point during that long scene you\u2019re describing, Michael considers killing a baby. How did you decide to inch towards that line?Green: It\u2019s certainly a choice. And that was a last-minute idea. We put a baby crib in the living room. We did that the day of. We scrambled to put it together just to have this moment ... an ethical choice. He is doing horrific things. Like there\u2019s a kind of a defenseless lady making a sandwich and watching Voyagers! on television and then he murders her. It\u2019s not like she had done anything harmful. So then I thought it was a fun thing to nod to an obvious ethical consideration and moving on. It added a level of Oh shit, what\u2019s going to happen? You also have an amazing kid actor who brings tremendous comedic energy to the end of that killing spree scene. Where did you find him?Green: Jibrail [Nantambu]. Most of what he says is improvised. That was his first movie. He had great energy and so we just kind of let him loose. In the audition, when we were auditioning kids, there was a closet door in the room, and I was like, \u201cNow I want you to open the closet door,\u201d because it\u2019s just interesting to see what kids would do. And he was like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m done.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to let some annoying, nerdy director tell him to go into a closet. I know you\u2019re pals with the elusive [Tree of Life director] Terrence Malick, who produced a few of your early films, but I was curious: Do you keep in touch? Do you talk about the movies you\u2019re working on? What\u2019s that relationship now? Will he see Halloween?Green: I moved away from Austin about a year to South Carolina and I haven\u2019t kept up with him. So I haven\u2019t talked to him recently \u2014 hopefully he\u2019ll see this movie and give me his thoughts. But anytime you talk to him about movies, you\u2019re just talking to him about comedies, which is the most genius conversation you could have. I once got a voicemail from one time after he watched Eastbound and Down that was just hilarious. He likes like White Men Can\u2019t Jump a lot. It\u2019s just funny: He\u2019s a very dramatic, serious filmmaker that he sets a lighthearted personality and his choices of entertainment. I really wish he\u2019d make a comedic film, that would be the best.Would you come back for a sequel to Halloween?Green: We\u2019ve got to make a hit out of this, but if there\u2019s a cool idea and there\u2019s good opportunity, sure.Wouldn\u2019t you be coming up with the idea? You haven\u2019t made many movies written by other people or clicked into the obvious studio strategy. You seem lucky in that regard.Green: [laughs] It\u2019s kind of up to this one to make me more commercially relevant because that\u2019s long since faded.If Halloween is a success, do you have a passion project on which you\u2019d cash in some chips?Green: The one thing I developed for years that I\u2019ve always wanted to do is Confederacy of Dunces. But that was caught up in so many legal snafus and rights issues and things like that. That\u2019d be fun someday to get that cleared off. Right now it\u2019s just basically overburdened with dead weight and nobody wants to go for it. Maybe someday."}
