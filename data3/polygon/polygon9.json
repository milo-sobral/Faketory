It also adds puddles \u2014 in the form of new stickers that you can stick onto your shots in photo mode, adding back some sorely missing pools of water to the game.The 4.7 GB update for Spider-Man, which Insomniac detailed earlier this week, is available now. Shortly after its release, Insomniac Games\u2019 user interface/user experience lead Gil Doron tweeted about its most amusing addition:We have a new patch today! Not only do we have NG+, but we added a bunch of stuff in Photo Mode, including:stickersframesrotation for stickersshortcut to Photo Mode with the D-Pad......and I fixed this for you :) pic.twitter.com/SW7Jxrxab6The addition of new puddle stickers is Insomniac\u2019s in-game response to accusations that the developer had \u201cdowngraded\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s visuals between its showing at E3 2017 and the game\u2019s release in September. A Reddit thread (with more than 30,000 upvotes) and tweets about the game\u2019s visuals, primarily focused on the shrinking of a very large puddle, rankled some PS4 owners who worried that Spider-Man\u2019s final product wouldn\u2019t live up to earlier previews of the game.\u201cIt\u2019s just a change in the puddle size,\u201d Insomniac said at the time, \u201cthere\u2019s no downgrade at all.\u201dInsomniac community director James Stevenson later addressed other accusations that the game had degraded visually during its development, responding to a tweet, \u201cI am telling you I talked to the technical and engineering and art staff, and looked at the live code of this from the final build. There was NO DOWNGRADE.\u201dThat mildly roiling controversy is, now, ultimately every Spider-Man player\u2019s gain, as they have new stickers to slap onto photos they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have."}
