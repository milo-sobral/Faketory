{"id": "Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s companion app makes the game much better", "paragraph": "There is a free companion app for Red Dead Redemption 2 that works on both iOS and Android phones and tablets. You\u2019re going to want to pick it up if you\u2019re playing the game, despite how tricky it can be to track down due to neither app store being concerned about clones or misleading app icons and names. Make sure you\u2019re getting the app developed by Rockstar Games \u2014 it helps to search for \u201cRDR2: Companion\u201d and not \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2.\u201d Or you can follow these direct links to the Android and iOS versions.But why does this app add so much to the game when the concept of the \u201csecond screen experience\u201d seems to have failed so conclusively in the past few years? This is counter-intuitive, but the companion\u2019s usefulness is due to the design of the game, not the app. Red Dead Redemption 2 indulges in a lot of skeuomorphic design, which is a way to present information or interactions on a screen so they resemble objects in the real world. The idea is that if your app looks like a notebook, everyone will understand how to take notes. A music application that looks like the front of a radio should have less of a learning curve. It\u2019s an idea that gets tricky now that we have generations of people growing up on apps and not actual notebooks or radios, but you can see why it was so attractive in the early days of smartphones. But skeuomorphism works well with the setting of Red Dead Redemption 2. The game presents catalogs, complete with illustrations and color text, when you go into stores. Reading things isn\u2019t the best experience on most displays, even in 4K, but scrolling through the catalogs to enjoy the pictures and descriptions on your phone or a tablet is a joy. It feels as if you\u2019re holding an object from the game. The same thing happens when you read Arthur\u2019s journal through the app; it\u2019s presented like a real book, open in front of you. You can page through it and read the text and look at the hand-drawn images even when you\u2019re not playing the game. There are some annoyances here, such as the catalogs loading in a browser and not saved in the app itself, and the inability to zoom in to see details while you\u2019re reading the journal. These decisions were likely made to keep the size of the app down, but they\u2019re still a bummer for those of us with plenty of storage space on our phones. But the rest of the app shows its value when it\u2019s linked to the game as you\u2019re playing. The map comes alive and shows your location in real time, while allowing you to zoom in and out, browse missions, and set waypoints. And you can do this at any point, without leaving the game itself. This changed how I was interacting with the game itself, and I\u2019m not the only one. \u201cI actually found the companion\u2019s map distracting at first, as I\u2019d always be looking down at my phone, and yanking my eyes off the screen all the time made the whole thing harder than if I\u2019d just left the HUD on,\u201d Kotaku\u2019s Luke Plunkett wrote. \u201cAfter a while though I found myself changing my habits; instead of always looking at the app as though it was an on-screen minimap, I started adapting and treating it more like an actual map.\u201dLooking at my options when I was trying to decide what to do next, or even going through the compendium to see what weapon I should use for hunting specific game \u2014 without pausing the game \u2014 helps maintain the illusion that this world is alive. I would often look at my map to see how close I was to my destination when I\u2019d go into the cinematic camera mode during long journeys, which helped make some of those trips less tiresome. It doesn\u2019t solve the problem of long, annoying trips where you\u2019re stuck traveling at another character\u2019s pace, but it at least makes them easier to tolerate. It\u2019s not that this app offers anything new. But it\u2019s such a good fit because it works so well within the design language and pace of the game it\u2019s meant to support. Companion apps don\u2019t make sense for every game, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is improved by the use of this one."}
