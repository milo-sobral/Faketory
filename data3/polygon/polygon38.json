{"id": "Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go! legendary Meltan\u2019s evolution revealed", "paragraph": "\tIt turns out that Meltan, the adorably small mythical Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019s exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Go, has an evolutionary form. The latest video in the Professor Oak/Professor Willow saga, released in anticipation of Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go!, introduces Melmetal \u2014 the first legendary Pok\u00e9mon evolution in the franchise. Unlike Meltan, which is only eight inches in height, Melmetal is over eight-feet tall. It also weighs nearly 2,000 pounds \u2014 which, in the clip, freaks out Oak and Willow, who aren\u2019t ready to transfer something that big between the Pok\u00e9mon Go and Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go! universes. Pok\u00e9mon lore dictates that Melmetal is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon that hasn\u2019t been seen in more than 3,000 years. Like Meltan, it\u2019s called the Hex Nut Pok\u00e9mon, even though it\u2019s way less cuter than its pre-evolution. The Pok\u00e9mon Company provided details on how to evolve a Meltan into a Melmetal, which we\u2019ve included below; note that Melmetal is another Pok\u00e9mon Go-exclusive, although it can transfer over to Let\u2019s Go!.The Evolution of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Meltan into Melmetal can only occur in Pok\u00e9mon GO and requires 400 Meltan Candies. Like Candies that can be collected for other Pok\u00e9mon, players can obtain Meltan Candies by catching Meltan (after opening a Mystery Box) and sending them to Professor Willow or by walking around with Meltan selected as their Buddy Pok\u00e9mon. Fans can also obtain Meltan Candies by sending that Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon GO to the Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! or Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Eevee! video games.Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go! launches on Nov. 16.
