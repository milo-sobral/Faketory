Shankar officially revealed his next project to be an animated Devil May Cry.\u00a0IGN confirmed plans with Shankar, who said Devil May Cry will join Castlevania in what is being referred to as a \"bootleg multiverse.\" He didn't provide much in the way of details, but he said he acquired the rights so \"the jabronis in Hollywood don't f*** this one up too.\" He also thanked fans for making Castlevania such a huge success, saying the series \"really over-performed.\"\u00a0\u00a0Judging from the photo he shared, it's safe to say Adi Shankar is excited about his latest acquisition.\u00a0\u00a0Open for business. pic.twitter.com/TCT5JH9fXz\u00a0This won't be a first for Dante and co. on the small screen, of course. Devil May Cry: The Animated Series ran for 12 episodes in 2007, with Shin Itagaki (Berserk, Teekyu) directing at anime studio Madhouse.\u00a0\u00a0-------Joseph Luster is the Games and Web editor at Otaku USA Magazine.
