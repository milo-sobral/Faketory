Entitled \u201cEverything Starts Somewhere,\u201d Eine elevates his ubiquitous typography artworks for the forthcoming presentation. More precisely, paintings of \u201crandomized poetry\u201d mixed with \u201csharp statements\u201d are employed with his trademark New Circus font. Accompanying the paintings, the artist will present a two-meter-tall metal sculpture of his letter S tag.\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to show my new works at StolenSpace gallery, particularly as this exhibition sees my work translate into new sculptural form \u2013 an exciting new direction for me. Walking around East London, there are entire streets of my work, so it\u2019s always extra special to exhibit here,\u201d said Eine in a statement.\u201cEverything Starts Somewhere\u201d will open to the public starting October 26 up until November 18.
