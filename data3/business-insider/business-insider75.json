{"id": "New research finds some purchasers are asking for 'Weinstein misconduct clauses' in M&A deals as scandals rock Silicon Valley", "paragraph": " From  Intel to  Google, sexual-misconduct scandals have unseated powerful executives in the past year and caused a lot of pain to many people.  Such scandals can be particularly problematic in the mergers-and-acquisitions space, where buyers take on risks financially and in reputation \u2014 sometimes without having all the information before signing the deal.  Executives are often seen as an asset to a company, so if one gets pushed out for misconduct, that devalues the acquisition. Past misconduct and potential future misbehavior open the new owner up to risks of legal action and expensive payouts.

Less than one-third of executives  surveyed by the business law firm Dykema said they had been involved in a deal with a so-called  Weinstein misconduct clause.

Of the respondents who said they had participated in deals with such a clause, about nine out of 10 said they had a \"knowledge qualifier,\" holding the sellers liable only if they didn't disclose misconduct known to the company.                                                                                                                                  Whether these clauses will grow in popularity remains to be seen, but it is clear that sexual misconduct will continue to be a factor in corporate M&A.
