Since the fires began on November 8, the wealthy coastal enclave of Malibu has been engulfed by the  Woolsey Fire, which has spread across more than 96,000 acres of land outside of LA and is now 35% contained. At least  two people were declared dead in Malibu on Friday. Their burned bodies were found in a car near Mulholland Highway.  Nearby, the  Hill Fire destroyed more than 4,500 acres, but is now 90% contained on Monday.  In Northern California, the Camp Fire destroyed the entire town of Paradise in less than a day. It's killed at least 42 people and decimated over 6,500 structures. Those numbers make it the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.  The Woolsey Fire has destroyed an estimated 435 structures so far, and more than 50,000 are threatened because of the blaze. Mandatory evacuations remain in place for people in Topanga, Malibu, portions of Calabasas, and a few other areas.  Take a look at how the luxury community has changed in the last few days.
