Despite the rise in popularity, building mass timber structures is still tough in many areas. In August, Oregon became the  first state to legalize mass timber high-rises without story limits, but remaining states still place height restrictions on wooden structures.  More recently, New York-based real estate firm Lotus Equity Group made a proposal for Riverfront Square, a New Jersey-based wooden office complex that would be the largest mass timber building in the country. The firm is collaborating with Michael Green Architecture and released details for its plan earlier this year. Take a look. Source:  GlobeSt.com"}
