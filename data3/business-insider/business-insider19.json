Business Insider/Mary Hanbury                                     Sarah Jessica Parker is bringing her luxury shoes to New York's Seaport District.  The actress turned businesswoman, who is best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on \"Sex and the City,\" opened her first permanent shoe store in Manhattan at the beginning of October.  Parker teamed up with George Malkemus, president of Manolo Blahnik USA, to launch the shoe brand in 2014, and it harks back to her days playing shoe-obsessed Bradshaw.  Sarah Jessica Parker shoes are also sold at luxury department stores and online-shopping platforms around the world.  Take a look around her new store:  This neighborhood has undergone a radical transformation in the past few years after decades of decline. It's now a vibrant shopping area and dining destination.  She launched the company in 2014 with the president of Manolo Blahnik USA, George Malkemus.  This was a fitting partnership for Parker, who's best known for playing Manolo-worshiping Carrie Bradshaw in \"Sex and the City.\" Source:  The New York Times \"I don't know how to be involved in another way,\" she told  The Times in October, explaining why she works on the shop floor when dropping in. \"I'm like that with my fragrances, with producing, with my children. To have one foot in the door, just checking in \u2026 That would feel fraudulent.\" "}
