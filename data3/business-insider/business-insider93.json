As  first reported by The Next Web, Dorsey touched on the topic while speaking at an event in India this week. Dorsey said Twitter has been \"considering\" the feature for a while, but the company wants to ensure they implement it \"in the right way.\"  \"We can't just rush it out,\" Dorsey said at the event. \"You have to pay attention to what are the use cases for the edit button.\"  Many who are calling on Twitter to add an edit button want an easy way to fix typos and spelling mistakes. But Dorsey expressed concerns over users abusing such a feature by changing the meanings of old tweets, which could have widespread implications for anyone who retweeted or favorited the post.  \"Ultimately, we need to make sure we're solving a real problem and solving a use case that people are seeing as friction within the service, and making that easy for people to do,\" Dorsey said.

However nothing ever came to fruition.  Social media has instead campaigned for the change with the rallying cry  \"tweets, but editable\" that users will often add onto typo-ridden posts they've already sent out. Kim Kardashian tried her own hand at lobbying for this cause in June, when she posted on Twitter  she had confronted Dorsey at a birthday party for her husband Kanye West. "}
