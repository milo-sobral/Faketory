You know what your partner loves, what small daily annoyances you can solve with a thoughtful gift, and how much they'll appreciate knowing the gesture came from you.  Odds are you want to give them something wonderful \u2014 whatever your price range is. All you need is a little direction, and a few great options to choose from. Looking for more gift ideas? Check out all of Insider Picks' holiday gift guides for 2018 here. Grafomap lets you design custom maps of anywhere in the world \u2014 like the first place you met, the best trip you ever took together, or the hometown she couldn't wait to show you. It's unique, thoughtful, and pretty inexpensive. You can find the full Insider Picks review here.  Keeping track of expensive, often tiny and delicate jewelry is difficult \u2014 and jewelry cases are a pretty and useful solution. Especially if you've gotten her jewelry in the past, or plan to in the future, this is a thoughtful (and personalized) gift. It's made from premium leather, comes in six colors, and can be monogrammed with her initials. Cuyana is also a cool leather bag startup she may have already heard of.  Everlane is a cult-favorite startup, and their $100 cashmere sweaters are one of their most popular products ever. Thanks to their transparent pricing, you get a really nice cashmere sweater for the price of a not-so-nice one \u2014 and this classic crewneck comes in 18 colors.  If she's especially environmentally conscious, check out Reformation's cashmere. It's more expensive ($148), but it's made from 70% recycled cashmere. If you're looking for something less expensive, cashmere startup Naadam has fantastic cashmere sweaters for $75, but they're prone to sell out.  Aquis' cult-favorite hair towels can cut the amount of time it takes your hair to dry in half \u2014 a claim we're happy to report holds up. The proprietary fabric also means there's less damage to wet hair while it dries.  Brooklinen is one of our favorite companies, point blank. We think they make the best high-end sheets at the best price on the market, and most of the Insider Picks team uses Brooklinen on their own beds.  The Luxe Hardcore Sheet Bundle comes in 15 colors and patterns, and you can mix and match them to suit your taste. Grab a gift card (delivered digitally or in a gift box) if you want to give her more freedom. If you opt for a sheet bundle, she'll receive a core sheet set (fitted, flat, two pillowcases), duvet cover, and two extra pillowcases in soft, smooth 480-thread-count weave.  Mejuri is a Canadian startup created in 2015 to make fine jewelry affordable to buy\u2014 and it has racked up wait lists with more than 40,000 people on them before. Their popular Zodiac Necklace is cool, minimalist, and something she can wear every day. It's made in gold vermeil with AAA quality white sapphires. And Mejuri's affordable pricing means the estimated traditional retail price of the same necklace elsewhere is closer to $235.  You can pick up a card from Walgreens on your way to exchange gifts, but it'll mean more if you think just a few days ahead. Etsy has great options for cheap, unique, handmade gifts that are cool and thoughtful. This one is handmade watercolor, and it's lovably funny and sweet.  If you want to gift an experience for the two of you to enjoy together, grab a card, a gift card to Journy or Airbnb, and come with a few location ideas in mind.  If you haven't heard of Journy, it's a startup that matches you with an expert travel planner to design the ideal trip for $25 per day \u2014 complete with booking hotels, making restaurant reservations, and keeping landmarks and local haunts in mind. If you want to surprise her with a trip already planned, go through Journy yourself and present her with the full, detailed plan.  Silk pillowcases reduce frizz and damage to hair and make it look shiny and healthy. It also reduces the likelihood of wrinkles and keeps skin hydrated overnight.  This particular Celestial Silk pillowcase is one of the internet's hidden gems. It's $40 on Amazon (less good options go for $85), but we rated it the best silk pillowcase you can buy in the Insider Picks buying guide. It's the one I personally own, and it makes a big difference for frizzy hair.  Leon and George is a San Francisco startup that will send beautiful plants \u2014 potted in stylish, minimalist pots \u2014 to her door. All she has to do is to occasionally add water. Flowers are wonderful, but houseplants have a much longer shelf life, and most of Leon & George's options are very easy to care for.  Birchbox is a skincare and makeup subscription that sends tons of samples of new and cult-favorite products to subscribers so they can find products they love without much commitment or cost upfront. Makeup and skincare products can be expensive, so this is a particularly helpful service. The gift box above includes a selection of best sellers plus a three-month subscription. Diptyque candles are expensive, but they're also adored \u2014 and they sell out frequently. These five mini candles are a good variety and will make her apartment smell good and feel cozy. Eventually, she (or you) can replace whichever scent she loves the most.  Local pasta-making classes, wine tours, pottery workshops, secret concerts, nature outings \u2014 you can book from thousands of local classes and experiences on Airbnb Experiences to make wherever you live feel new, exciting, and full of possibilities. It's also an under-utilized part of Airbnb, making it a thoughtful and unusual gift \u2014 and one you may keep using yourselves for out-of-the-box date nights in the future. Find out more here.  Dagne Dover is quickly becoming one of the best women's handbag companies to know, and their Lola Toiletries Pouches are a great and relatively affordable gift. The small size ($75) is perfect for everyday makeup essentials, and the large ($105) can be used for toiletries, makeup, or as a small purse. It's made from beautiful pebbled leather, and you can pick from seven foolproof color choices.  If she loves coffee, she'll probably love to try Driftaway Coffee. It's a gourmet coffee subscription that gets smarter the longer you use it \u2014 remembering your preferences and steering you towards increasingly accurate brews for your specific tastes. The first shipment will be a tasting kit with four coffee profiles, which she'll rate online or in the app to start getting personalized shipments.  It can be hard to do yourself justice in words \u2014 whether they're spoken or written in a card. This compilation of love letters written by great men can help you say it without actually technically saying it.  Girlfriend Collective is an affordable, unique fitness startup that makes stylish workout gear \u2014 which also happens to be made out of eco-friendly materials like recycled fishing nets and plastic water bottles in ethical factories.  Snowe's $98 unisex bathrobe has been called the best and most absorbent terry robe on the market, and I'm one more fervent believer. The company traps each cotton fiber with air for extra absorbency, it's soft and plush, and the unisex sizing means it will feel like a blanket-turned-robe. Perfect functionality, and extra points for coziness.  The Leesa Blanket is one of the best bedroom accessories we've discovered\u2014 well-made, soft and supple, and perfect year-round. It has two layers so it's weighty enough to feel warm and substantial, and we've seen it hold up well over time without pilling or breaking down.  Winc is a personalized wine club \u2014 and we think the best one you can belong to overall. Members take a wine palate profile quiz and then choose from the personalized wine suggestions. Each bottle has extensive tasting notes and serving recommendations online, and makes it easy to discover similar bottles.  Gift her a Winc gift card, and she can take a wine palate profile quiz and get started with her own customized suggestions.  This gift may seem inexplicably expensive, but it's actually considered a steal to those with either product on their wish lists (retail value: $465). The award-winning Dyson blow dryer is covetable, and lauded as the best one ever invented; It prevents hair damage by measuring air temperature 20 times per second, has a specially designed Dyson motor for fast drying, and reduces static, breakage, and makes hair look smooth and shiny.  The Ouai products are from celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin's personal line. She's best known for stylish the Kardashians, Jessica Alba, and Sofia Vergara.  Manduka is known for making the best yoga products, and their Yogitoes towel is one of the most loved. It has tiny 100% silicone nubs on one side that grab yoga mats and keep yogis from slipping around during the exercise. Having a good towel can make a big difference.  It also comes in 19 great colors and gets eco-friendly points. Each Yogitoes towel is made from eight recycled plastic water bottles, and made with dyes free of azo, lead, or heavy metal.  Pair these with her favorite comfy products for an ideal \"night in\": bath bombs, sheet masks, candles, wine, and maybe a gift card to her favorite place to order take-out from.  Boutique fitness classes are expensive. ClassPass makes them less so. With ClassPass, she can drop into diverse exercise classes at tons of different specialized studios for $15 or less per class (about half their traditional cost). If she likes to be kept active, is looking for a newfound favorite class, or likes yoga as much as barre classes, this is a great gift she'll actually use.  This is an award-winning mask with a big following in the beauty and skincare community. It's $80, but it's an at-home pro-quality facial she can use anytime \u2014 which is a fraction of the price required for regular facials.  Blue Bottle's Cold Brew Bottle is one of the most attractive and no-fuss ways to make cold brew at home. It's a Japanese design, a glass bottle, and a bestseller with Blue Bottle's Tokyo guests.  Away's hyper-popular suitcases deserve their hype. Their hard shell is lightweight but durable, their 360\u00b0 spinner wheels make for seamless traveling, and the external (and ejectable and TSA-compliant) battery pack included can charge a smartphone 5x over so she never has to sit behind a trash can at the airport for access to an outlet again. It's also guaranteed for life by Away. Find our full review here.  Dagne Dover has already made it on this list, but this weekender is another fan-favorite that makes for a particularly great gift. It looks cool thanks to the great color options and unique neoprene material (think: scuba gear), and the stylish organization is second-to-none (think: padded laptop sleeve, water bottle pocket, and stretch key leash for easy access). It's great for weekend trips, staycations, and as a carry-on.  Grab her 16 sheet masks to make it easier for her to have a frequent and well-deserved \"treat yourself\" day. These 16 are highly-rated and have both vitamin E and collagen included for healthy, happy skin.  Daily Harvest is a food startup that makes it possible to eat healthy, delicious meals for less than $10 each even if you only have 30 seconds to spare for prep time. Meals are pre-portioned, delicious, and designed by both a chef and a nutritionist to make sure they're tasty and good for you. It addressed all my healthy eating roadblocks.  If she loves books, Book of the Month is an especially thoughtful and unique gift \u2014 it's a book club that has been around since 1926, and it's credited with discovering some of the most beloved books of all time (\"Gone with the Wind\" and \"Catcher in the Rye\" to name a couple).   If you gift her a subscription, she'll receive a hardcover book delivered to her door once a month. Books are selected by a team of experts and celebrity guest judges.  If she's really more into audiobooks or e-reading now rather than hardcovers, check out a gift subscription to Scribd (full review here).  Grab these handmade popcorn seasonings (white cheddar, salt & vinegar, buttery garlic, and smokey BBQ) from Uncommon Goods and make some fancy popcorn for a movie night. Or, make a reservation at a nice restaurant, stock up on her favorite movie candy and some fun drinks ahead of time (wrap them for an extra wow-factor), get a Fandango gift card, and take her out for a dressed-up version of the classic movie date.  This bath bomb gift set has six vegan bath bombs made from natural essential oils. Each bath bomb's scent corresponds to a specific use: lavender for relaxation, grapefruit for energizing, and so on. They also have over 3,000 five-star reviews.  If she loves having a nice glass of wine and/or cooking, she'll appreciate the thought behind these unique wine pairing towels. Grab a bottle and some corresponding ingredients for a fun night in for the two of you.  Find the best holiday deals on our Black Friday Deals and Cyber Monday Deals page.
