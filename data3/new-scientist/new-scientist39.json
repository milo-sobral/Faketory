This is in contrast to the the World Health Organisation\u2019s recommendation that mothers should exclusively breastfeed their babies for the first six months of life.Rates for breastfeeding babies between 6 and 8 weeks old\u00a0has stayed relatively stable in England for the last four years only varying by a couple of percent each year, according to data from NHS England. However, the rates vary significantly by region.Eight in 10 babies were being breastfed\u00a0between 6 and 8 weeks old in Tower Hamlets, London compared to less than two in 10 in Knowsley, Merseyside.In many cases women are unable to continue breastfeeding\u00a0even if they want to, and that so few are able to meet the guidelines suggests that in their current state they may be unrealistic for many women.The NHS Start for Life website says that there are many advantages of breastfeeding, including health benefits for both babies and mothers. Breast milk protects babies from infections and provides a \u201cperfect balance\u201d of vitamins and nutrition for infants, according to the website.Breastfed babies have a lower chance of cot death and childhood leukaemia, they also have a lower risk of allergies and are less likely to develop diabetes or become overweight when they are older. Benefits for women include reducing their risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.More on these topics: A shorter version of this article was published in New Scientist magazine on 3 November 2018"}
