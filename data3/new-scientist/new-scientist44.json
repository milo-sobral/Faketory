Trueba/Madrid Scientific FilmsBy Colin BarrasThe Neanderthal rib cage was subtly different in shape from our own \u2013 and that could help explain how the heavily built ancient humans grabbed enough oxygen from the air to survive.We now know a huge amount about Neanderthals \u2013 we\u2019ve even gained some insights into their sex lives \u2013 but there are still gaps in our understanding.The precise shape of the Neanderthal chest (or thorax) is one of those gaps, says Asier G\u00f3mez-Olivencia at the University of the Basque Country, Spain. \u201cRibs and vertebrae are fragile and have a limited fossil record,\u201d he says.But there is one Neanderthal specimen that does have most of its spine and rib cage preserved \u2013 a 60,000-year-old skeleton that belonged to an adult male. It is named \u201cKebara 2\u201d and it was found in Israel in the 1980s. G\u00f3mez-Olivencia and his colleagues have now generated an accurate 3D reconstruction of the Neanderthal rib cage using Kebara 2 as a guide.We know that Neanderthals had bodies that were stockier than ours, which suggests that they burned more energy than we do. \u201cHeavier bodies require a higher caloric intake and a higher oxygen consumption,\u201d says G\u00f3mez-Olivencia.This has led researchers to assume Neanderthals had a bigger chest than we do, to hold larger lungs. But Kebara 2\u2019s rib cage was the same size as ours. \u201cThis was one of the big surprises of the study,\u201d says G\u00f3mez-Olivencia.The Neanderthal rib cage was, however, subtly different in shape. When viewed from the front, it is wider at the bottom than a typical modern human rib cage.This could be significant, says G\u00f3mez-Olivencia. The lower rib cage is where the diaphragm lies. This sheet of skeletal muscle contracts when we breathe. G\u00f3mez-Olivencia and his colleagues think that if Neanderthals had a wider \u2013 and larger \u2013 diaphragm, it could have\u00a0sucked in\u00a0stronger inhalations.This means the Neanderthals\u2019 lungs could have expanded more with each breath, taking in more air \u2013 and more oxygen. \u201cThe wider and larger lower thorax would cope with [their] oxygen necessity without any problem,\u201d says G\u00f3mez-Olivencia.Journal reference: Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06803-z\u00a0More on these topics: A shorter version of this article was published in New Scientist magazine on 10 November 2018"}
