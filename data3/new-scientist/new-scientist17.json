Nevertheless, that\u2019s where the\u00a0BepiColombo spacecraft is going \u2014 it\u2019s a joint mission by the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The spacecraft will launch towards the hellish planet closest to the sun on 20 October.We have only sent two spacecraft to Mercury before: Mariner 10, which flew by three times in 1974 and 1975, and Messenger, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015. Those two missions taught us a great deal about the planet, but they also uncovered mysteries and left many more questions unanswered.Mariner found that Mercury has a magnetic field, which was unexpected \u2014 Venus, Mars, and the moon don\u2019t have them. BepiColombo will measure the structure of this strange field and hopefully help us figure out how it got there.The planet\u2019s surface is no less weird. Messenger spotted what seem to be pools of ice at the centres of craters near Mercury\u2019s poles, which likely stay cool because sunlight never reaches the craters\u2019 bottoms. But we don\u2019t know how the ice got there in the first place. It also saw strange dips in the ground that don\u2019t appear to be impact craters and do not appear on any other planets we know of.\u201cMercury has a few unexpected results from previous missions which bring into question our planet formation models,\u201d says BepiColombo project scientist Johannes Benkhoff. \u201cIf we can follow on with BepiColumbo and find a solution, that for me would be the most exciting thing that we could do with this mission.\u201dBepiColombo will carry with it two orbiters, one dedicated to studying the planet itself, from its iron core out to its tenuous atmosphere, and one to study its magnetosphere, the larger area of space within its magnetic field.But before BepiColombo can work on solving any of these mysteries, it has to get to Mercury \u2013 and that is a challenge in and of itself. \u201cYou need almost the same amount of energy to bring a spacecraft to Mercury as you need to go to Pluto, although Pluto is 50,000 times farther away from Earth,\u201d says Benkhoff.To avoid flying right past Mercury and falling into the sun, the craft will take the scenic route, looping back around Earth once, Venus twice, and Mercury six times to get the energy it needs to get into orbit. If all goes well, BepiColombo will reach its final destination in December 2025.More on these topics: "}
