The blockchain-secured service will sequence people\u2019s genomes without charging a fee, and offer rewards to those who let third parties access their data.Consumers can already get their DNA sequenced by companies like 23andMe and Helix, but it typically costs around $200. If a user consents, their results can be sold to third parties such as pharmaceutical firms, but users don\u2019t receive any compensation or reward for this.Nebula Genomics, which launches today, is\u00a0intended to connect consumers interested in exploring their genetics with researchers looking for large DNA datasets to assist with drug development. Co-founder George Church is a well-known pioneering geneticist at Harvard University, whose other\u00a0ambitions include bringing back the woolly mammoth, editing our genes to fix diseases, and reversing ageing.The service offers to sequence your entire genome for free and secure it using a blockchain. You can then share your genomic data anonymously with companies or research institutes of your choosing, in return for \u201cNebula credits\u201d.Users will also receive credits for sharing other health information, like whether\u00a0they\u00a0have diabetes or arthritis. This should\u00a0help researchers identify patterns between certain gene variants and diseases, and potentially identify novel drug targets, says the company\u2019s co-founder Dennis Grishin.The credits\u00a0earned by users will\u00a0allow them to access other services on the Nebula platform. For example, they could be used to purchase information about\u00a0a user\u2019s\u00a0risks of developing certain diseases like breast cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on their\u00a0genomic data.For the time being, users won\u2019t be able to convert the credits into hard cash. Pharmaceutical companies are currently prepared to pay upwards of $1000 for individual genomes, but Nebula hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to allow cash transactions, says Grishin.Jacqueline Savard at Deakin University in Australia warns that some drug companies may use people\u2019s data in ways they aren\u2019t aware of or can\u2019t foresee. \u201cPeople should be free to do what they want with their genomic data,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they need to be given clear information about how it will be used so they can make the right decisions.\u201dMore on these topics: "}
