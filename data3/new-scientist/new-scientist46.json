And just as even fun dreams can have a deeply personal and sometimes disturbing edge, Maniac is about a method (more pharmacological than psychiatric) of exploring memory, sadness and trauma. It\u2019s the latest in many recent shows and films\u00a0\u2013 from Westworld to Inside Out and Inception\u00a0\u2013 that draw heavily from science to bolster a complex, puzzle-box narrative.The show is set in an uncanny valley 21st-century New York City. We see robot dog-mess collectors trundling along the sidewalks, but people use dot-matrix printers and monochrome monitor displays from the 1980s. New York harbour is dominated by a huge, winged, Statue of Extra Liberty, and Blade Runner-esque neon ads are seen through apartment windows.Our heroes are Owen Milgrim (played by Jonah Hill), who is the depressed, neglected and possibly schizophrenic fifth son of a wealthy Manhattan family, and Annie Landsberg (Emma Stone), a penniless young woman who can\u2019t move on from a terrible family tragedy. In an attempt to rid themselves of their psychological baggage, the two, who don\u2019t know each other initially, sign up to a drug trial at the sinister Neberdine Pharmaceutical Biotech.There is more than a hint of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind here. Rather than simply\u00a0erase memories, the Neberdine trial puts subjects into a deep dream state,\u00a0then monitors and guides their dreams using a supercomputer. There is now good evidence that dreams may partly function to process emotionally powerful experiences, so we are off to a good start here. Unfortunately the computer in Maniac has been programmed to develop empathy, and subsequently becomes depressed.The result is basically a sequence of extended dreams where, mysteriously, Owen and Annie meet up and have adventures. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga and writer Patrick Somerville have obviously had a lot of fun, and Stone in particular relishes the actor\u2019s dream of playing many different roles.In one hallucinated adventure, set in the 1980s, Owen and Annie are married and attempting to rescue a captured lemur. In another they are Bonnie and Clyde-like con artists attending a 1940s seance. In the most spliffed-out episode, Annie is a wood elf in a Lord of the Rings world. Seeing Emma Stone with pointed ears playing a world-weary elf with a booze problem and a British accent is one of the many highlights of this show.Maniac\u00a0is fantasy, of course \u2013 and not just in the Lord of the Rings\u00a0sense. But\u00a0there are several ways that real-world drugs are being used to treat psychological disorders. Psychoactive medicine has a long history, but perhaps the most relevant to Maniac is the use of ibogaine.A highly psychoactive chemical derived from the central African rainforest tree\u00a0Tabernanthe iboga, ibogaine is classed as an illegal drug in most countries, but there have been some clinical trials. As we reported a few years ago, there is good anecdotal evidence that even a single dose of ibogaine can reduce cravings for heroin and other drugs. Despite its legal status and not-scientifically-validated effects, the drug is used in guided hallucinatory therapy in many countries.Ibogaine, like the three different fictional drugs used in Maniac, brings on intense hallucinations. \u201cIbogaine can take you many places, causing you to experience a range of emotions, memories and visions,\u201d says Jeff Israel, who runs a clinic in Baja California, Mexico, which administers the drug.Other trials have shown promising results for the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD or psilocybin to treat depression, and there is evidence that the use of such drugs can lead to changes in personality.\u00a0 Recent work has shown that psychedelic drugs can help the brain form new connections.Maniac is a kooky, clever and thoughtful piece of entertainment, lavishly funded by the Netflix purse. It doesn\u2019t promote the use of psychedelic drugs to treat mental health issues, but I applaud it for taking seriously the idea that psychedelics have a role to play in medicine.More on these topics: "}
