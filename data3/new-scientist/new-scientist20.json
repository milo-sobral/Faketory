The discovery supports the idea that Archaeopteryx really is a transitional species between dinosaurs and their bird descendants, and not an evolutionary dead end as has been suggested.Archaeopteryx was first recognised as a species in the 1860s. It was immediately seized on as evidence for Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, because it appeared to be a bird with dinosaur-like traits. It had wings and feathers, but teeth instead of a beak. The obvious implication was that Archaeopteryx was a transitional fossil, showing how birds evolved from dinosaur ancestors.It was about the size of a raven and may have had black feathers. It\u2019s been suggested that it only flew in short bursts like a pheasant, and hunted at night.However, over the last decade\u00a0its position in the evolutionary tree of birds has been called into question, following the discovery of similar dino-birds in China. A 2011 study built a family tree and concluded that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur, not a bird.Martin Kundr\u00e1t at the University of Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik in Slovakia and his colleagues have now studied a hitherto-unexamined Archaeopteryx fossil.It was found in the early 1990s, apparently in a quarry near Daiting, Germany, and ended up with a private collector. For years it remained unknown and was nicknamed \u201cthe Phantom\u201d, until in 2009 palaeontologist Raimund Albersd\u00f6rfer bought it. It is now on long-term loan to the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology in Munich.The fossil contains most of the skull, plus parts of the shoulders and left wing. It is encased in rock and has been squashed, but Kundr\u00e1t scanned it using high-powered X-rays. \u201cWe can see every preserved bone,\u201d says Kundr\u00e1t. \u201cNot only that, we can see these bones from inside.\u201dThe team found subtle differences in the bones and teeth not seen in the other known fossils of\u00a0Archaeopteryx. Kundraat\u2019s team has put the specimen in a new species, Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi.Some of the bones are hollow, which makes them lighter. Modern birds have similar bones to help them fly, implying the species could fly.When the team built a new family tree of birds and related dinosaurs, it placed the new species of Archaeopteryx at the base of the bird (or avian) line. \u201cIt\u2019s in an important position to tell us about the early evolution of avian dinosaurs,\u201d says Kundr\u00e1t.\u201cIt looks more and more likely that Archaeopteryx really is somewhere on the lineage towards recent birds,\u201d says Oliver Rauhut of the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology in Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that it is an ancestor to later birds,\u201d he says, because the odds are against a direct ancestor being fossilised, but \u201cit gives us a good idea what a very early bird might have looked like\u201d.Flight arose \u201cprobably three times\u201d and maybe more among bird-like dinosaurs, says Rauhut. He points to Microraptor, a dinosaur with flight feathers on its legs as well as its wings that probably glided. \u201cIt had nothing to do with the origin of birds.\u201d Another dinosaur, Yi qi, had membranous wings like those of a bat.\u00a0Journal reference: Historical Biology, DOI: 10.1080/08912963.2018.1518443More on these topics: A shorter version of this article was published in New Scientist magazine on 3 November 2018"}
