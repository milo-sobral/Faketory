That may now change, thanks to a new method of testing an embryo\u2019s genes that could soon be available in some IVF clinics in the US, New Scientist can reveal.The firm Genomic Prediction says it has developed genetic screening tests that can assess complex traits, such as the risk of some diseases and low intelligence, in IVF embryos. The tests haven\u2019t been used yet, but the firm began talks last month with several IVF clinics to provide them to customers.For intelligence, Genomic Prediction says that it will only offer the option of screening out embryos deemed likely to have \u201cmental disability\u201d. However, the same approach could in future be used to identify embryos with genes that make them more likely to have a high IQ. \u201cI think people are going to demand that. If we don\u2019t do it, some other company will,\u201d says the firm\u2019s co-founder Stephen Hsu.For many years, it has been possible to do simpler genetic tests on embryos as part of IVF. For example, parents at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis have the option to undergo IVF and select an embryo that doesn\u2019t carry the gene behind the condition. It is also possible to screen for several other conditions caused by a single gene, as well as those caused by chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down\u2019s syndrome.However, most medical conditions are influenced by hundreds of genes, which has made it impossible to screen out embryos with a high risk of heart disease, for example, or select embryos with a low likelihood of experiencing depression. This is true for traits like intelligence too.In recent years, it has become possible to work out a person\u2019s likelihood for having certain conditions or traits by analysing many DNA regions at once to calculate something called a polygenic risk score (see \u201cPredicting an embryo\u2019s future traits\u201c).Genomic Prediction is the first company to offer polygenic risk scores for embryos rather than adults. The firm is mainly promoting its tests as a way of screening out embryos at high risk of certain medical conditions. But the company\u2019s polygenic test for \u201cmental disability\u201d is more controversial. It isn\u2019t accurate enough to predict IQ for each embryo, but it can indicate which ones are genetic outliers, giving prospective parents the option of avoiding embryos with a high chance of an IQ 25 points below average, says Hsu.\u201cIf we consider inclusion and diversity to be a measure of societal progress, then IQ screening proposals are unethical,\u201d says Lynn Murray of Don\u2019t Screen Us Out, a group that campaigns against prenatal testing for Down\u2019s syndrome. \u201cThere must be wide consultation.\u201dInformation from the same test could be used to go one step further and select whichever embryo is most likely to have a high IQ. \u201cWhat that corresponds to is way-above-average intellectual potential,\u201d says Hsu.For ethical reasons, Genomic Prediction won\u2019t help parents select high-IQ embryos in this way. Nevertheless, it seems likely that other firms will do so in future. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen in the US, it will happen in another country,\u201d says Kevin Mitchell of Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.The idea of using such tests to select embryos predicted to have high intelligence is \u201crepugnant, but technologically feasible\u201d, says geneticist Peter Visscher at the University of Queensland, Australia.Intelligence is only one trait the firm can give a polygenic risk score for. Others on offer include heart disease, breast cancer, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.All the geneticists New Scientist spoke to agree that the principles behind polygenic testing are valid, but Mitchell says the service may be of limited use in practice, because many people using IVF have just a few embryos to choose from.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet fully understand what other effects genes involved in intelligence may have\u201dWhat\u2019s more, if these embryos all share the same biological parents, they are unlikely to show much variation in their polygenic scores for various traits. Also, we don\u2019t yet fully understand what other effects the many genes involved in traits like a higher intelligence or lower risk of heart disease might have. For example, some studies have suggested that people with higher polygenic scores for academic ability are also more likely to be autistic.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re selecting for and what comes with it,\u201d says Visscher. \u201cBut there are people who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their dead pet cloned. I\u2019m sure there are people who would do this.\u201dIn the UK, screening embryos for polygenic conditions isn\u2019t currently allowed \u2013 they can only be screened for simpler genetic conditions.But some IVF doctors want that to change. \u201cI take my hat off to what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a potential revolution,\u201d says Simon Fishel, president of the Care Fertility Group clinics in the UK.Genetic testing for complex traits used to be impossible. That\u2019s because they are affected by hundreds of different genes, each with just a small influence, only a small fraction of which have been identified.But thanks to studies involving hundreds of thousands of people, more DNA regions implicated in these kinds of traits have been found. A study published in July found more than 1000 DNA regions that together accounted for 13 per cent of variation in academic achievement.And their influence can be higher in certain people. For example, a rare gene variant may only account for a tiny percentage of variation in intelligence across a population, but it may make a big difference to the IQ of those who have it.As it becomes possible to estimate the future intelligence of an embryo (see main story), some prospective parents will discover that some of their IVF embryos have a high chance of intellectual disability, while others may find that one of their embryos is likely to be especially clever.There are no certainties, but for a few this could make a big difference. The July study found that 60 per cent of those with a genetic score in the top fifth of the group got a university degree, compared with 10 per cent of those in the bottom fifth.This article appeared in print under the headline \u201cChoose your child\u2019s intelligence\u201dLeader: \u201cNew techniques may soon make designer babies a reality \u2013 are we ready?\u201dMore on these topics: Magazine issue 3204, published 17 November 2018Previous articleNew techniques may soon make designer babies a reality \u2013 are we ready?Next articleMixed results for science in the US midterm elections"}
