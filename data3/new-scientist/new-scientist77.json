The full investigation can be read here by subscribers.LIGO\u2019s 2015 announcement of the discovery of gravitational waves was one of the most exciting findings in physics for decades. The discovery\u00a0confirmed a prediction made by Einstein, that space-time itself can squeeze and stretch in rhythmic waves, when deformed by cataclysmic events, like the collision of black holes. The collaboration\u2019s founders were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 2017.But detecting gravitational waves is hugely challenging. LIGO\u2019s detectors aim to measure a shortening of space equivalent to about a thousandth of the width of a proton. This sort of measurement is swamped by natural thermal vibrations, known as noise, that make picking out the signal from a gravitational wave tricky. To deal with this, the collaboration used\u00a0sophisticated analysis techniques to remove this noise\u00a0their data, but these analysis techniques are being questioned.The claims were first aired by a group of Danish researchers a few years ago. Since then, they have published their doubts in\u00a0a peer reviewed journal.\u00a0The LIGO collaboration has not yet\u00a0published\u00a0any papers clarifying their approach in response.That much was common knowledge in the physics community. But\u00a0the\u00a0New Scientist investigation uncovered a number of irregularities, including a published data plot drawn \u201cby eye\u201d rather than with real data.LIGO now says they are\u00a0in the process of preparing their paper, which will provide more information about their analysis techniques, but has not stated when this is likely to be published.More on these topics: A shorter version of this article was published in New Scientist magazine on 10 November 2018"}
