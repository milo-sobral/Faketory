This has the added effect of reducing DNA damage and premature ageing.Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) rays that can damage DNA and lead to premature ageing and skin cancer. To protect against this, our skin produces melanin, a dark pigment that acts like a natural sunscreen. The pigment starts to form within hours of sunlight exposure and gives the skin a tanned look.Carmit Levy\u00a0at Tel Aviv University in Israel and her colleagues measured how much melanin mice produced when they were exposed to UV light every day, every second day, or every third day.They assumed that melanin production would be highest in the mice exposed to the most frequent UV periods. \u201cSimilarly, you\u2019d think that someone who went to the beach every day would tan more than someone who went every second day,\u201d says Levy.However, to their surprise, they found that the mice that tanned the most were those\u00a0exposed to UV light every second day. The extra pigmentation they produced meant their skin also suffered the least DNA damage.The researchers then repeated the experiment using human skin samples and found the same pattern.Together, the findings suggest that skin cells need 48 hours between sun exposure periods to build up their maximum defences, says Levy. \u201cIt\u2019s like your muscles \u2013 you need to give them time between gym sessions to let them recover,\u201d she says.Her team is now trying to work out the evolutionary reason behind the two-day melanin cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s strange because ancient humans would have been exposed to sun most days, so we don\u2019t know why it takes 48 hours to work,\u201d she says.One possibility is that it is tied to vitamin D, which is also released after sunlight exposure and remains elevated in the blood for 48 hours. \u201cWe think the two systems might be linked,\u201d says Levy.\nJournal reference: Molecular Cell, DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2018.09.022More on these topics: A shorter version of this article was published in New Scientist magazine on 3 November 2018"}
