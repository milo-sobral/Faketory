It\u2019s a prototype handheld spectrometer, a point-and-click device that can see, via infrared radiation, how apparently identical consumer products can differ in their chemical make up.Those worries prove unfounded: the technology works perfectly. BBC science presenter Michael Mosley puts the device through its paces, and the connected smartphone app displays the results. The scanner correctly differentiates between olive and sunflower oils, rye and wheat flour, sugar and the sweetener erythritol, and silk and polyester. Other people have a go too \u2013 no training required.Hertzst\u00fcck is the name of the sensor inside this \u201clab for the pocket\u201d. It\u2019s the sensor that enables all the magic. When the spectrometer device comes to market, it will provide a fast and easy way to test a huge swathe of food products for potential allergens or unwanted contaminants \u2013 as well as testing medicines and chemicals for purity, and crops for signs of drought or readiness to harvest. \u201cYou don\u2019t need access to a huge laboratory any more,\u201d says Valouch, who is trinamiX\u2019s group leader for sensor development. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you can use this device while in a restaurant, or shop \u2013 or even while standing in a field of ripening maize.\u201dBASF created trinamiX GmbH in 2015 as a spin-off company to exploit the discovery of its Managing Director, Ingmar Bruder. He spotted that a specific solar cell material had potential for use in 3D scanning technology.Part of the development involved miniaturising lead sulphide detectors of near-infrared radiation and shielding them with a nanometre-thick encapsulation layer to prevent degradation by oxygen and water. The 3D-scanning tech is still going full steam ahead, but the BASF researchers realised that in their miniature near-infrared detectors, they had inadvertently developed the perfect basis for a handheld spectrometer.Spectrometers are used around the world for analysing the chemical make-up of a vast range of materials. They work by exciting molecules with radiation, then examining the resulting emissions. Large near-infrared spectrometers are already available, but the tiny trinamiX version opens up a new swathe of applications \u2013 including being put into a smartphone. \u201cThe Hertzst\u00fcck sensor with its encapsulation is only around half a millimetre thick, and that makes it possible to build a spectrometer that fits into a smartphone,\u201d says Valouch.The prototype spectrometer uses four small incandescent lamps to fire low-intensity infrared radiation, with wavelengths between 1 and 3 micrometres, at the product under investigation. Different molecules respond to infrared radiation by vibrating at different frequencies, and with different harmonics. That means each kind of molecule in the sample has an individual infrared fingerprint. The Hertzst\u00fcck device sends the detected fingerprint to a computer, which searches a database for materials with the same signature.The first commercial application of Hertzst\u00fcck will probably be in that area of agriculture and will give farmers the ability to make better decisions, for example about the right time to harvest or the products they are using. \u201cThere\u2019s a real need for determining whether the herbicides they buy are the real deal or inferior counterfeits,\u201d Bruder says. \u201cEuropean companies lose a billion euros a year to fake herbicides, and the farmers can have their crops ruined because of it.\u201d And that\u2019s only the beginning: foodstuffs are also a common source of fraud (see \u201cSeeing through the fakes\u201d).It\u2019s not just about fighting crime, though. Within a few years, trinamiX thinks you will be pointing your Hertzst\u00fcck-equipped phone at supermarket food to see if it contains non-vegan ingredients, for instance. You might even raise your phone to your cheek to see if that new moisturiser you bought really is holding in moisture.Before then, supermarkets will be using Hertzst\u00fcck to check product freshness on the shelves. This is already working, and it impressed Mosley at the London Restaurant Festival. \u201cThat means you can measure the fat or water content of a cheese without opening the packaging, and do the analysis right there in the supermarket,\u201d he told the crowd.Indeed, the Hertzst\u00fcck sensors are already used for industrial applications that depend on the reliable detection of infrared light, like flame detection.More at: www.BASF.com/hertzstueckCounterfeiting is a multibillion-dollar business worldwide. It\u2019s not just about works of art, money or branded clothing, though. Counterfeited food is such a major issue that the US House of Representatives has expressed concern and called for better ways of sampling and testing foodstuffs. Investigators have found olive oil contaminated with seed oils, for instance, and peanuts that were deliberately mislabelled as more expensive pine nuts. These are dangerous practices that can kill people who are allergic to the hidden contaminants.One of trinamiX\u2019s big hopes is that its Hertzst\u00fcck device can overcome the growing problem with adulteration, in which valuable ingredients are mixed with cheaper, similar-looking chemicals. One example, particularly prevalent in Asian markets, is the adulteration of milk powder with melamine. Standard fraud detection equipment looks at the nitrogen content of the powder, but melamine is not different enough from milk in this respect \u2013 it still looks good. \u201cBut near-infrared spectroscopy can distinguish between pure milk powder and milk powder contaminated with melamine, so that\u2019s something we can stop,\u201d Valouch says.The Hertzst\u00fcck device can also distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. If the sensitivity can be tweaked sufficiently, it might even be possible for future versions of the detector to tell apart the various grades of olive oil, something that could halt the world\u2019s most widespread food fraud in its tracks.Textiles importers will also be able to put the Hertzst\u00fcck scanner to work. Near-infrared spectroscopy can tell the difference between a variety of fibres, sorting silk from cotton, and cotton from a polyester-cotton mix. Those equipped with the device will be able to tell whether manufacturers are using cheaper fibres than they claim.Shoppers should benefit too as and when the device is embedded in smartphones. \u201cIn a clothes shop you\u2019ll be able to use your phone to determine what kind of fabric their clothing is made from,\u201d says Valouch.This article appeared in print under the headline \u201cScanning the future of food\u201dMagazine issue 3204, published 17 November 2018Previous articleIran\u2019s imprisoned conservationists need scientists to speak upNext articleMystery \u201cspace cow\u201d is a weird new type of powerful space explosion"}
