But still, the species isn't well known to science.While these octopuses may generally be little-known, scientists have identified 14 species of the Grimpoteuthis genus, though Ocean Exploration Trust scientists couldn't determine which species they captured on the ROV's camera.What is known, however, is that Grimpoteuthis are largely deep-dwelling critters, and they have two U-shaped fins on their sides that they often use to propel themselves through the water.SEE ALSO: The wilderness has returned to idyllic Cape Cod. That means great white sharks.While moving through a light falling of marine snow, the octopus travels around the water almost like a jellyfish, before revealing its long, almost webbed tentacles.\u00a0Marine scientists acknowledge that our vast oceans are poorly explored. Much of the deep sea remains uncharted \u2014 similar to distant moons orbiting Saturn and Jupiter.\u00a0Earth's undersea realm largely remains a mystery."}
