{"id": "Mashable5 ways you can stand up for domestic violence survivors", "paragraph": "Over the course of one year, an average of 10 million women and men are physically abused by an intimate partner in the U.S.\u00c2\u00a0Domestic violence can take the form of physical, psychological, or economic abuse, and it is a national issue that affects people of all ages and genders, though the majority of victims are women. Survivors do not report abuse for many reasons, including fear of gaslighting. Despite years of progress, domestic violence remains a silent epidemic.\u00c2\u00a0\"The first step in supporting survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and all forms of violence and discrimination, is to listen to them and believe them,\" says Ted Bunch, co-founder and chief development officer of A Call To Men, a violence prevention organization that teaches men and boys to redefine masculinity.\u00c2\u00a0SEE ALSO: Serena Williams shows different side of domestic violence in chilling videoOctober is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, an initiative created by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence to raise awareness about domestic violence issues and advocate for legislation that helps victims.\u00c2\u00a0Here are five ways to support survivors this month and beyond:The Violence Against Women Act has helped educate law enforcement, provided resources for investigations, and funded programs that support victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The legislation has arguably contributed to the decline of domestic abuse incidents in recent decades.\u00c2\u00a0On Sept. 30, the Violence Against Women Act was set to expire, but Congress extended it with stopgap funding through December 7. Until then, it's important to call your representatives and urge them to reauthorize this bill. If you're not sure what to say, you can use the the script provided by 5calls.org.\u00c2\u00a0Congress has yet to reauthorize the bill because it proposes to ban convicted stalkers or anyone subject to a protection order from buying or owning firearms. It would also close what's known as \"the boyfriend loophole,\" a federal exemption that permits unmarried or childless abusers and stalkers to own a gun. Because of these gun-related provisions, the bill has become a partisan issue.\u00c2\u00a0And that brings us to the next point...U.S. gun laws fail to protect victims in several ways. According to Everytown For Gun Safety, an American woman is fives time more likely to be killed in a domestic violence situation when a gun is present. Thirty-one states allow abusers to skip background checks if they buy guns online or at gun shows. Even though federal law prohibits certain domestic abusers from owning guns, only 15 states require those subject to domestic violence restraining orders to turn in their guns.\u00c2\u00a0March For Our Lives organizers have published a list of demands regarding gun control, one of which tells Congress to close the loopholes in the background check system. You can support their efforts by signing this petition, starting a local chapter, and voting for midterm candidates that believe in common-sense gun policies. You can find such candidates at Gunsensevoter.org, a project of Everytown For Gun Safety Action Fund and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Don't forget: Election Day in 2018 is Tuesday, Nov. 6.\u00c2\u00a0A2. American women are 5x more likely to be shot and killed when a gun is present in a domestic violence situation. Keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers is a necessary step to create #Safety4Survivors. https://t.co/v6CVk3qTl0 pic.twitter.com/zWd6D53k8C\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Everytown (@Everytown) October 16, 2018Ted Bunch, of A Call To Men, believes embracing and promoting healthy manhood is essential to preventing all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u00c2\u00a0\"All men have influence and a platform to spur positive social change.\"\u00c2\u00a0\"To prevent domestic violence, we have to understand how all men are socialized to view women and girls as property, objects, and as having less value than men,\" says Bunch.In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, A Call to Men launched Moving Forward in Solidarity, a five-week campaign that offers practical ways men can act in solidarity with women. Actions include calling out sexist language, demonstrating consent, and modeling healthy, respectful manhood. Whether or not you participate every week, you can help shift society's understanding of masculinity by sharing the campaign on social media, and now is most certainly the time for men to step up.\u00c2\u00a0\"There are so many men afraid to say the wrong thing,\" says Bunch. \"Don't let that fear keep you from coming to the table.\u00c2\u00a0All men have influence and a platform to spur positive social change.\"\u00c2\u00a0Bunch suggests learning more about this cultural shift through Tony Porter's TED Talk and Man Enough, a web series hosted by Jane the Virgin star Justin Baldoni.There are numerous anti-domestic violence organizations to support. Bunch recommends checking out Joyful Heart Foundation, which was founded by Mariska Hargitay. (You might recognize her as Olivia Benson on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.) The foundation works to help survivors heal and aims to use education and advocacy to transform the way society responds to violence. You can donate to fund Joyful Heart's efforts here. You can also spread awareness about the foundation's #SupportAfterDV campaign, which allows survivors to anonymously share how they were supported by loved ones after their experience.\u00c2\u00a0How can you support a survivor of domestic violence? For #DVAM2018, we asked survivors just that. This October, our #SupportAfterDV campaign will explore the different ways survivors felt supported after a DV experience\u00e2\u20ac\u201din their own words.

If you'd like to get involved you can donate, attend an upcoming event, promote the hashtags #SurvivorSpeaks and #TakeAStand, or download the 2018 toolkit, which includes online resources like sample social media messages and educational graphics.\u00c2\u00a0Financial abuse takes place when an abuser takes control of their victim's finances. It can include restricting access to bank accounts, ruining their credit, and more. Although it's deemed an \"invisible\" form of domestic violence, it occurs in the vast majority of domestic violence cases.\u00c2\u00a0Financial abuse makes it impossible for victims to support themselves or their children, and for this reason, many victims cannot leave abusive relationships. Victims that do leave sometimes return for different reasons, including because they cannot financially support themselves.     \n\n\n\n\n  View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that time of year again!!!

As an extension of their entrepreneurship program, FreeFrom launched Gifted by FreeFrom, an online store that sells products made by survivors and employs survivors to handle the packaging and shipping.\u00c2\u00a0FreeFrom is also one of nearly 300 domestic violence nonprofits participating in the Allstate Foundation Purple Purse Challenge.\u00c2\u00a0The challenge raises funds to support services, such as financial aid and financial empowerment.
