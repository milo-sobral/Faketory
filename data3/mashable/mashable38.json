{"id": "MashableTwitter shames Trump for doing the absolute least in the wake of explosive devices", "paragraph": "UPDATE: Oct. 24, 2018, 2:34 p.m. EDT Updated to include Trump's statement at White House opioid eventAs authorities investigated explosive devices sent to the home of Hillary Clinton, the office of Barack Obama, and the building that houses CNN's New York office, President Donald Trump incurred the wrath of Twitter for putting in the least possible effort condemning the threats by quote-tweeting Vice President Pence.\u00c2\u00a0Earlier in the day, Pence sent a tweet condemning the actions as \"cowardly\" and \"despicable,\" the kind of message you expect from a leader. Trump, then, decided the best he could do was a quote tweet of Pence with an added line that amounts to \"Yeah, what he said!\"I agree wholeheartedly! https://t.co/ndzu0A30vU\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2018The White House also put out a statement, via Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, condemning the devices, but Trump's tweet was his first direct response to the series of incidents.\u00c2\u00a0Statement on suspicious packages: pic.twitter.com/pYSbDvCvuk\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) October 24, 2018Twitter users were incensed by the lackadaisical response, especially considering the recipients of Wednesday's devices, as well as billionaire George Soros who received a similar device earlier this week, are all favorite targets of Trump's angry rhetoric. Trump has repeatedly lead chants of \"Lock Her Up!\" at rallies in reference to Clinton; he was a primary catalyst behind the racist conspiracy theory questioning Barak Obama's birthplace; and frequently has referred to CNN and other journalism outlets as the \"enemy of the people.\"hell yeah, lay down that minimal effort\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Dusty (@DustinGiebel) October 24, 2018The President of the United States cant even be bothered to type his own tweet actually condemning these acts of terrorism on American soil. https://t.co/awfyGylG1c\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) October 24, 2018"}
