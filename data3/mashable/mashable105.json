{"id": "Mashable'The Crimes of Grindelwald' makes a major Harry Potter canon blunder", "paragraph": "Critics everywhere have slammed the latest Harry Potter spin-off, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, as there's an absurd amount of confounding plot crammed into the 134-minute film.\u00c2\u00a0Yet, the film carries a problematic canonical oversight, too: Minerva McGonagall briefly appears as a young-adult wizarding instructor at Hogwarts in 1927. The trouble is, according to Harry Potter lore, she wouldn't have even been born at that point.Fantastic Beasts 2 takes place in 1927 and features a 20-something Minerva McGonagall teaching at Hogwarts. BUT according to Pottermore, Professor McGonagall was born on October 4, 1935 making her a -8 year old Professor. Impressive.\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Rohita (@rohitak) November 17, 2018(Pottermore, for those who might not know, is the online portal for all things Harry Potter and Wizarding World. It features original writing from creator J.K. Rowling that is recognized as official canon.)As Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling reveals in the original series, the famously strict Professor McGonagall first started teaching at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1956, when she was a spry 21 years old.\u00c2\u00a0mcgonagall in 1995: I've been working at Hogwarts for 39 years me: ok so she started in 1956 - jkr: WRONG AGAIN FOOLISH MUGGLE, she's teaching at Hogwarts in 1927! pic.twitter.com/mfvdAsdNqE"}
