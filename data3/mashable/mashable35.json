{"id": "MashableFacebook will let you add music to your profile, so you can pretend like Myspace never died", "paragraph": "Facebook, never one to balk at taking inspiration from a competitor, may be reaching pretty far back in its history with its latest update.The social network is working on a new feature that will let you add songs to your Facebook profile, which will inevitably spark comparisons to the original Facebook rival: Myspace.SEE ALSO: We made you a Spotify playlist for your next karaoke partyThe feature, which Facebook plans to start testing \"soon,\" will let users add songs to their profiles. These songs will either appear in a new, dedicated \"music\" section, or at the very top of your profile if you opt to \"pin\" a song.People who visit your profile will then be able to listen to part of a song and view photos of the artist. These songs will also link to the artist's Facebook page.There will be \"millions\" of songs available, according to Facebook (it's the same music catalog available via Instagram Stories), though it's not clear how long it will take the feature to roll out broadly.But what's most interesting about the feature is how similar it is to one that was popular on Myspace more than a decade ago. There were several iterations of music players for Myspace profiles, the ability to feature a song (or handful of songs) on your profile page was an incredibly popular feature. (Side note: Spotify has a number of playlists that offer some grade-A Myspace nostalgia.)Elsewhere on Facebook, the company is also expanding new music features to Stories. Much like music in Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories will be able to link to music via a new music sticker.The company is also updating its Musical.ly-like feature, called LipSync Live, with support for lyrics (making it more like the karaoke feature that was detailed in a patent filing earlier this year).\u00a0"}
