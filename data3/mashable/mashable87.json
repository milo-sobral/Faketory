{"id": "MashableBeto O'Rourke and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have mastered Instagram Stories", "paragraph": "In a world increasingly obsessed with social media, today's politicians have found a secret weapon: Instagram stories.By documenting their daily activities using Instagram's Stories and Live features, rising political stars like Beto O'Rourke and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have given supporters a rare glimpse at some of the most humanizing moments in their lives.For many, the stripped down, extremely casual content \u00e2\u20ac\u201d think cooking dinner at home or doing DIY projects with family \u00e2\u20ac\u201d serves as a refreshing change from polished speeches and the formality of campaign trails. And so far political Instagram seems to be a big hit.Fans of Beto O'Rourke know that throughout the course of his Senate campaign the man didn't shy away from social media. He frequently shared photos, videos, and messages on Twitter and often went live on Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u201d usually while driving or visiting Whataburger.part of the beto mystique is that he understood how to use social media as an influencer, and not a politician\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Astead (@AsteadWesley) November 11, 2018But since O'Rourke conceded the midterm election to Ted Cruz, his primary social media outlet has been Instagram. Since his midterm loss, O'Rourke has eaten chips and guac in the car while driving, made homemade slime with his daughter, gone on a hike with his family, and even cooked a flank steak marinated in soy, lime, ginger, and freaking garlic.SEE ALSO: Beto O'Rourke dropped the f-bomb on live TV and people love itI know all of this deeply personal information not because I have Twitter notifications turned on for him (which I do), but because he openly shared it with his 550,000 followers, in real time, on Instagram. We are not worthy.good night everyone, enjoy this video of beto & some guacamole \u00e2\u2122\u00a1 pic.twitter.com/NUsf2VHoVf\u00e2\u20ac\u201d kati (@guurlalmighty) November 9, 2018Beto making slime with his daughter my HEART \u011f\u0178\u2019\u2022 pic.twitter.com/Gy9pKm2Feo\u00e2\u20ac\u201d caroline \u011f\u0178\u0152\u00bb beto 2020 (@stuffedwhales) November 10, 2018At the end of the day, Beto's just a regular guy with a family who loves food and isn't going to let his loss keep him from living his life. And that's what makes his carefree IG Stories such an absolute mood.\u00c2\u00a0Beto's content is so relatable that often people have no choice but to screenshot his posts and literally write \"MOOD.\" And while everyone is, of course, entitled to privacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially following a public election loss \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the fact that Beto's opening up to his followers and sharing bits of his family's life means a lot.\u00c2\u00a0Tag your self I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the steak pic.twitter.com/mnNYuznKuZ\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u0161\u00a1beto still has my \u011f\u0178\u00a4\u00a7\u011f\u0178\u2019\u2013\u00e2\u0161\u00a1 (@HARRYSMUSE) November 12, 2018on beto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instagram story today he was just driving and eating chips and guac and it was just the biggest mood\u00e2\u20ac\u201d e\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2li\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2za (@LAPlDOT) November 9, 2018Beto making slime on his Instagram story with his daughter is a MOOD\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u2020\u2019 (@thecleelife) November 10, 2018Beto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Instagram stories are sunsets, cats, eating chips and guac while driving.

People liked knowing she was surviving, thriving, and living her damn life. And though there are many parts of his day he doesn't show, Beto gives a similar sense of reassurance with his Instagram stories.\u00c2\u00a0Though Beto definitely has the \"cool dad politician\" gap filled, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the 29-year-old who just became the youngest woman elected to Congress \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is making the most of Instagram's Story features, too.In the days since midterms, she's used the social media platform to chat politics with her 507,000 followers while cooking up Instant Pot mac and cheese on a Friday night, publicly listen to Janelle Mon\u00c3\u00a1e, and give the world a glimpse of what it's like to do all that post-campaign laundry that builds up.um alexandria ocasio-cortez is literally making instant pot mac n cheese on instagram live and talking about politics and listening to janelle monae on a friday night. this is the representation i am here for!!!!!!! @ocasio2018 never change pic.twitter.com/A3AcrXbTC3\u00e2\u20ac\u201d eel notyep (@peyIRL) November 10, 2018.@Ocasio2018 AOC on Instagram doing her laundry at a public washer saying how members of Congress never have time to do laundry AS IF most of them do their own laundry \u011f\u0178\u2019\u20ac\u011f\u0178\u2019\u20ac true representative of the people!!! \u011f\u0178\u2018"}
