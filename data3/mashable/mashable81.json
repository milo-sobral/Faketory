{"id": "MashableWhat your favorite home assistant command really says about you ", "paragraph": "No matter what kind of home assistant or smart speaker you\u2019re on a first name basis with, chances are you\u2019ve reached co-dependent status with it \u2014 because no one wants to physically do things when you can yell at a piece of plastic to do it instead. Playing actual board games? It\u2019s not 1984. Jotting down things for your to-do list? Uh, pens are practically an endangered species. Knowing things? Please, there\u2019s the internet for that.\u00a0Our go-to commands get us through the day, but when you really think about it, your favorite requests actually reveal a lot about your character. Here, we take a closer look at what your choice commands could be saying about you.\u00a0When you ask your home assistant to set a timer, you feel like the boss of your domain. Heaven forbid you should have to take out your phone to manually do it on some digital app. No, you have things to do! You are clearly a precise, punctual, and to-the-point person, which means you are efficient with your time and can\u2019t waste precious seconds on anything beyond asking a timer to be set for you. We\u2019re talking as little effort as possible \u2014 just a shout, if you will \u2014 because you\u2019re too busy multitasking or trying to get in a 6-minute cat nap to worry about an alarm, too.\u00a0If you ask a smart speaker to read you the news, you\u2019re mildly interested in what\u2019s happening around you and want the anyone who\u2019s tracking your digital footprint to think that you\u2019re smart. Optics are important to you, and how are you to keep up appearances if you don\u2019t have a loose grasp on current events? A firm grasp might require actually picking up a newspaper or scrolling through a news site \u2014 but the former would get ink on your fingers and the latter would put you at risk for carpal tunnel, so you respectfully decline and prefer to consume your news aurally. It\u2019s eco-friendly and efficient, and everyone loves a twofer.We all need to know what time it is, but our phones, clocks, or watches aren\u2019t always nearby. Asking for the time is a natural question for a hands-free assistant, especially when you, well, have your hands full. Now, if you\u2019re the type to ask what time it is multiple times, that\u2019s just peak laziness. Get quiet, dig deep, and ask yourself: Are you happy with this sloth life? You also may be suffering from acute lethargy and should consider consulting a physician.Sometimes you have a song in your head and you just need to hear it in real life. Other times you just need to fill the deafening silence in the room. Either way, you\u2019re a fantastic human being because you like music and everyone knows that music is awesome and makes the world go \u2018round. Also, if you have friends who don\u2019t like music, they\u2019re probably robots and you should excise them from your social circle immediately.\u00a0No longer can you make it through more than five waking minutes of the morning without knowing what the weather is. How will you decide what to wear? What if you\u2019re too hot or too cold? Do you need an umbrella? Ultimately this says you\u2019re the type who likes to be prepared for anything. Not only do you ask what the weather is, you also try to mine additional information by posing your question in other clever ways: What\u2019s the temperature? Is it going to rain today? Fear not, A-types. To ensure you\u2019re always primed for the elements, wear layers. And remember: If it\u2019s fall or winter, it\u2019s always sweater weather.\u00a0"}
