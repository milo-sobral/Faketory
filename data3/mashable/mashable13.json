The decision, Deadline reports, stemmed from creative differences between the creative team and higher-ups at both Netflix and Marvel.SEE ALSO: 'Iron Fist' was canceled and the internet has strong opinionsThe Luke Cage writers team had just handed over script drafts for the first part of Season 3, which would have been 10 episodes, down from the usual 13 for a Netflix/Marvel show (the quickly canceled Defenders did eight).\u00a0This decision comes on the heels of Iron Fist being canceled, but that was without a season currently in development (and Iron Fist, famously, sucks). As Deadline notes, this means the plug could get pulled on Jessica Jones Season 3 or The Punisher Season 2 at any point in development or production, which doesn't inspire confidence.\u00a0Additionally, Disney, which owns Marvel, is launching its own streaming service, though no plans exist yet to resurrect these shows once that platform launches. Perhaps the best outcome of these back-to-back cancellations would be a Daughters of the Dragon series with Iron Fist's Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) and Luke Cage's Misty Knight (Simone Missick), but we realize that's a lofty dream.On Friday, Netflix premiered Daredevil Season 3, whose positive reviews hearken back to the early days of the Marvel/Netflix live-action team up when there were fewer characters, shows, and seasons for viewers to keep up with. It sure looks like the end is night for New York's humble heroes after the last seasons trickle in, but we wouldn't say no to a final team up before they go.Or, come to think of it \u2013 Kevin Feige, you up?"}
