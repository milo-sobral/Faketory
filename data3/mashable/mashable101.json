They were met with hundreds of protestors who wielded Gritty signs like a crucifix against a vampire.\u00c2\u00a0The Proud Boys, a group cooked up by Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, promote violence and preach masculinity above all else; the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the group an alt-right \"fight club.\" Although McInnes has attempted to distance the Proud Boys from white supremacist groups, its members have attended violent rallies like the one in Charlottesville. One of the group's more notable rules includes not allowing its members to masturbate more than once a month.\u00c2\u00a0In response to the conservative rally, organizers pulled together a counter protest called the PushBack Campaign.\u00c2\u00a0\"The residents and allies of Philadelphia must stand in opposition to this escalation of the far-right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push into the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture and politics,\" the event's description declares.\u00c2\u00a0And Gritty, who's already been embraced by the left as an antifa hero, was beautifully represented by PushBack protestors. Let's just take a moment to appreciate these heart-warming Gritty-inspired signs.\u00c2\u00a0gritty signs abound still pic.twitter.com/SYSwn7S1zX\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Bethany Ao (@BethanyAo) November 17, 2018First Gritty sign sighting on Independence Mall. pic.twitter.com/15rrPOaMdv\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Brian P.
