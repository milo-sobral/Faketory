{"id": "MashableTexas schools make slavery a 'central' fact of the Civil War and no one can believe it", "paragraph": "Kids in Texas will finally learn that slavery was the primary reason for all the fighting during the Civil War, and people can't believe it took the state this long to decide that.\u00c2\u00a0The state Board of Education confirmed that starting in 2019, public school curricula will include the fact that slavery played a \"central role\" in the war. During the vote Friday, the board also added Hellen Keller and Hillary Clinton back to the lesson plans. The two women were controversially removed in September in an effort to \"streamline\" the statewide standards.\u00c2\u00a0SEE ALSO: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election was a 'traumatic experience' for many college studentsThe previous curriculum listed sectionalism and states' rights before slavery in statewide social studies standards. According to NPR, Republican board member David Bradley wanted students to learn about the other causes because \"each state had differences and made individual decisions as to whether or not to join into the conflict.\"\u00c2\u00a0\"I mean, that's the definition of states' rights,\" he argued.Although Democrats on the board pushed for slavery to be the only taught cause of the Civil War, the majority-Republican board drew up a compromise. In the new set of standards, public schools will teach students about \"the central role of the expansion of slavery in causing sectionalism, disagreements over states' rights, and the Civil War.\"\u00c2\u00a0Lawrence Allen Jr., the only black member of the board, hopes the new standards will reinforce the connection between slavery and the Civil War since there's no \"consensus\" over the war's causes.\"And so if we can't drive it to a consensus in our state, we need to let our students look at it from all points of view,\" he said.\u00c2\u00a0The wider population of Americans (and other social media users), however, can't believe that it took Texas this long. Although it's a step forward in acknowledging the country's dark history, many believe it isn't enough.\u00c2\u00a0omg i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m teaching my brothers about slavery and they are beyond shook, this is why i don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust the texas education system. they should know this already\u00e2\u20ac\u201d soulja bich (@socialist_spice) November 12, 2018I mean, slavery is THE reason the war was fought, but baby steps Texas, baby steps https://t.co/CJ3rtderBC\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Max Culbreath (@MaxCulb) November 17, 2018It only took them 155 years\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Alt USDA_ARS (@AltUSDA_ARS) November 17, 2018It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outrageous that this even happened. The way we do (or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) memorialize history can directly affect the types of policies and laws within the state #LALS172 @LALS_Falcon\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Michelle Rivas (@_rmmichelle) November 17, 2018"}
