It's a mindset that led to more human stories, but also one that unavoidably flirted with the political climate as well.\"Sophisticated literature can come in many forms, and if you write off an entire industry because you're too stupid to see that? Well. I feel sorry for you. Also, Bill Maher's show isn't exactly sophisticated television compared to a Breaking Bad or a Sopranos."}
