{"id": "MashableRebel Wilson is blocking critics on Twitter after her 'first plus size rom-com lead' gaffe", "paragraph": "Rebel Wilson caught some heat on Thursday for declaring herself the first plus-sized woman to be the lead in a romantic comedy. (Her new film Isn't It Romantic comes out next Valentine's Day.)\u00c2\u00a0She was wrong: Queen Latifah and Mo'Nique, for example, have taken on such roles in the past.I still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that Rebel Wilson doubled down on the lie that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first fat actress to star in a rom-com. Like Mo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Nique didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t snag a handsome doctor in Phat Girlz! Like Queen Latifah didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get Common AND LL Cool J!"}
