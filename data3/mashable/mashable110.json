Just before 8:00 p.m. PT, Musk shared a video of a mammoth boring machine breaking through an opening to mark the end of the company's Hawthorne tunnel.pic.twitter.com/TQhb9hQRxQ\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 17, 2018Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel!

It runs the SpaceX headquarters (another Musk-founded company) and follows Hawthorne's 120th St. for about two miles.An opening ceremony is planned for Dec. 10, at which point the public will be able to check out the tunnel for the first time. It's worth noting that The Boring Company's website describes the soon-to-be-completed bit that will open on Dec. 10 as only the \"first section\" of what will presumably be a longer Hawthorne tunnel.There are other projects in development as well. Also in L.A. is the \"Dugout Loop,\" which will give the residents of Los Felix, East Hollywood, and Rampart Village easier access to Dodger Stadium. Outside of California, The Boring Company is also working on a \"Chicago Express Loop\" for easier access to the city's O'Hare Airport and an \"East Coast Loop\" that will connect Washington, D.C. and Maryland.The Hawthorne tunnel is the smallest of those projects, and can accurately be characterized as The Boring Company's proof-of-concept tunnel. Still, with the Dec. 10 opening now less than a month away, opening up the other end of the tunnel \u2014 which workers have been sealing off behind the boring machine \u2014 is a major step forward."}
