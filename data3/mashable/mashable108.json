A newly released video delivers a snippet of the main theme Williams composed for the park.SEE ALSO: Check out Disney's theme park-exclusive 'Star Wars' land merchandiseAs you can see, the video also contains looks at various corners of the unfinished park. I definitely spotted an interior from the Millennium Falcon. There are also looks at the alien world of Batuu and the Black Spire trading outpost, which together make up the bulk of the themed Star Wars area.You can read more about them straight from Disney, right here.In addition to the music video, Disney also released two brief looks at the main attractions at Galaxy's Edge. The first, Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run sounds like a cross between the old Disney Star Tours attraction and the video game Star Trek: Bridge Crew.The ride \"puts guests behind the controls of the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy in one of three unique flight crew roles,\" says Disney.The other attraction, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, \"puts guests in the middle of an epic battle between the Resistance and the First Order.\"It's not clear from the video how the attraction actually works, but early chatter from Disney has suggested there's a role-playing element to the guest experience at Galaxy's Edge. Rise of the Resistance could be one facet of that.The wait won't be much longer. Galaxy's Edge opens at the Disneyland Resort in the summer of 2019, and subsequently opens at Florida's Walt Disney World Resort in the fall of 2019."}
