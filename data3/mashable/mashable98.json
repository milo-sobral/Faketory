{"id": "MashableSave $200 on the VR-ready Alienware 15 gaming laptop, on sale at Best Buy", "paragraph": "As a gamer myself, I know we can be a demanding bunch. But are clear graphics really too much to ask for? Do you think we enjoy playing games on laptops that make everyone look like potatoes? (Yes, that's a thing.)Considering the glut of games that have already come out this fall, like Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, a new laptop is a necessity to enjoy them on the go. Luckily, the holiday season also means the best gaming deals of the year are here.\u00a0The Alienware 15 R3 is available at Best Buy for $1,599.99, which is $200 down from the original price of $1799.99.Under the hood, the Alienware 15 comes packing an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, 16GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD. These will help limit load times heading into games that could be painfully slow on other computers and, sometimes, consoles. And with a 1TB HDD, you shouldn't have to worry about storage space for a bit.Image:  DellBut all that would be a moot point if the graphics card doesn't deliver. Lucky for you though, it does. You'll get the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070, ideal for a laptop like this. This can handle most of those demanding needs for games like Battlefield V which, as any gamer will tell you, needs some serious power to run on its best settings.As an added bonus, the 15 is VR-ready. Considering there are some laptops pushing $4,000 that aren't VR capable, this says a lot about Alienware. Snag the deal below while you can.
