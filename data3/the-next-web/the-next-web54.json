The desktop computer will now come in a Space Grey finish and comes with either four or six core processors.According to Apple, this will make the Mac Mini five times faster than previously \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise as the last version of the hardware was released four years ago.This is how Apple presented the speed upgrade at the keynote:The previous Mac Mini had 16GB of RAM. Now, it can be upgraded to 64GB of\u00a02666 MHz memory. That\u2019s quite a lot of memory, which is great news for designers and video editors.Apple has also increased the storage space of the device up to 2TB \u2013 double the previous capacity. These are up to four times faster than the old Mac mini. Again, something to be expected when the last version of the device was released so long ago.Probably the most interesting thing Apple has done with the Mac Mini is focus on connectivity. In fact, it might have actually listened to users. The device includes an ethernet slot,\u00a0four Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports.Oh, and did we forget to say it has a headphone port too? Praise be.Have a look at all of the ports here and drool:Apple has also put its T2 security chip into the Mac mini. Some of its features include an SSD controller that provides your data with encryption as you work.Apple will make the new Mac mini\u00a0with 100 percent recycled aluminium and\u00a060 percent recycled plastic. Apple\u00a0actually invented its own\u00a0aluminum alloy, something it used in the Mac Mini.And, well, the more I think about it, the more badass this seems.The entry-level Mac Mini will come with 8GB of memory, a 3.6Ghz quad-core Core i3, and a 128GB SSD \u2013 it\u2019ll retail for $799. It\u2019ll be released on November 7 and pre-orders are open today.Stay tuned to Plugged for more updates.\n                                    Published October 30, 2018 \u2014 14:45 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 30, 2018 \u2014 14:45 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
