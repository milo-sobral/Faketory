Astronomers of the future will see the distant reaches of our universe through the magic of teleportation.Technically, it\u2019s called \u201centanglement,\u201d but it works pretty much like teleportation. Basically a couple of quantum particles become \u201centangled\u201d with one another in such a way that anything that happens to one particle happens to the other, even if they\u2019re separated by physical distance.Hard Fork.We wrote a whole thing about it you can read here.The big idea here is that with the assistance of quantum technology, we can make really, really big telescopes. And that\u2019s a pretty big deal. The biggest telescope we can make right now comes in the form of the Extremely Large Telescope (seriously, that\u2019s its name). Its mirror is a mere 40 meters across and it cost a cool billion dollars.Luckily, engineers have come up with a solution to deal with the ridiculous expenses of building giant telescope mirrors: they put smaller mirrors in groups called arrays. Unfortunately, these arrays can only get so big before there\u2019s too much data loss \u2013 called noise \u2013 for scientists to be able to get useful images from them. That limit is somewhere around the equivalent of a 330 meter mirror, if you judge by the largest array made so far.These telescope systems represent what many experts consider to be the peak of what we\u2019re capable of doing under today\u2019s industrial limits. Sure, with a little more time and billions of dollars more we might reach some modest size increases, but we\u2019re probably hovering around the edge.Quantum entanglement could change all of that, but unfortunately the way it would (theoretically) work involves shooting a constant stream of entangled photons off into space. Despite recent breakthroughs, our grasp of quantum computing, as a species, isn\u2019t strong enough to perform that kind of Herculean feat of quantum engineering. The sheer number of photons involved reaches into, well, astronomical proportions.But what if there was a way to cut the number of entangled photons needed down to a more practical number?That\u2019s exactly what the Harvard team did.Basically their work indicates that by exploiting a phenomena called \u201cquantum memory\u201d the number of entangled photons needed for the telescope of the future to function is much lower.According to the researchers:The necessary rate of entanglement distribution is reduced by several orders of magnitude, which opens up realistic prospects for employing near-term quantum networks for high-resolution imaging.What does this mean? For starters, the team suggests a telescope array could be created with a size-equivalent of 30 km \u2013 100 times larger than the biggest by today\u2019s standards.As the Harvard team\u2019s work informs further development \u2013 and quantum computing hardware advances continue \u2013 it\u2019s now almost certain that telescope optics will become larger and higher resolution with less expensive materials needed.Eventually this means costs should come down, which will go a long way towards ushering in the quantum era of astronomy.It\u2019s entirely feasible that we\u2019ll one day have planet-sized telescopes moving throughout our galaxy, capturing images of planets being born, stars dying, and intergalactic pizza delivery drones bringing Earth\u2019s greatest export to the hungry masses.One day we\u2019ll reveal the darkest corners of our universe. And we\u2019ll teleport pictures of what dares dwell in them across it\u2019s expanse, thanks to the wacky nature of quantum physics.\nRead next:\n\n        How to review and delete your Google search history    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
