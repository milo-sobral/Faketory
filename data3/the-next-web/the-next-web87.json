Invented 33 years ago, Tetris barely needed evolve thanks to its simple ingenuity. It\u2019s meditative and infuriating at the same time. It induces anxiety, but it also helps people that struggle with that same anxiety. You don\u2019t need to tell anyone Tetris\u2019 rules, because they are so simple and intuitive that anyone can quickly deduce them, simply by looking at the game in action.\u00a0It\u2019s called Hard Fork DecentralizedTetris\u2019 appeal hasn\u2019t gone lost on Tetsuya Mizuguchi. The influential Japanese game designer behind titles like Rez, Every Extend Extra and Lumines, is back from his short hiatus and he made a Tetris game. Mizuguchi is known for combining trippy visuals, pumping soundtracks and addictive gameplay.His games look like a stroll through Tokyo\u2019s neon-drenched streets, on a designer drug that hasn\u2019t been invented yet. They\u2019re mesmerizing in a way that no other game is. Needless to say, I was beyond stoked when I first found out that Miz\u2019 first new original game since 2011 was a Tetris adaption.Tetris Effect came out last week and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect of a Mizuguchi Tetris game. It\u2019s the Tetris we all know and love, plastered onto over 30 different trippy stages.The visuals, the music, the sound effects, and the controller vibration all respond to your inputs, slowly slipping you into a trance-like state while you arrange your blocks to form lines. The game\u2019s main mode takes you on a journey through all the stages, increasing the tempo \u2013 and thus the difficulty \u2013\u00a0as you progress.I couldn\u2019t stop playing the first night I got my hands on Tetris Effect. I loved Tetris when it was monochrome and simple on the Gameboy. I love Tetris even more when it has Mizuguchi\u2019s special sauce all over it. Tetris is easily the best way to experience Tetris (by yourself). I deeply regret selling my PlayStation VR headset because I hear that the VR support in Tetris Effect is amazing. Ah well.There\u2019s one thing that irks me about this game though; it\u2019s a pretty barebones package for a $39.99 game. Sure, it has a ton of stages and a fair bit of different marathon and challenge modes, but that\u2019s about it. It has leaderboards with weekly challenges, but no multiplayer at all, not even local. Tetris Effect would\u2019ve been perfect as a party game if it let you play against your friends. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume and compete. But alas, it\u2019s a completely solo affair.Tetris Effect is an easy recommendation for anyone who\u2019s looking to play an amazing version of Tetris. The lack of multiplayer is a bummer, but the amazing audiovisual experience makes up for it. And $39.99 is still cheaper than most drugs.\nRead next:\n\n        Here\u2019s how blockchains could be ruined by personal data    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
