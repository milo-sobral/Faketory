For instance, fraudsters deliver malware under the cover of CV spam [with an attachment] that has a malware embedded in the document,\u201d the summary explains. \u201cAfter the local network is successfully compromised, the hackers browse the local network to find work stations and servers used working with private cryptocurrency wallets.\u201dGroup-IB expects the number of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges to rise, and not just the ones from Lazarus. It warns the most aggressive hacker groups, usually known for attacking banks, will shift their attention to cryptocurrency exchanges now they know just how lucrative it can be.The report also reveals 10 percent of the total funds raised by ICO platforms over the past year and a half have been stolen. A majority of the funds were lost to phishing.Group-IB attribute much of the losses to baddies taking advantage of \u201ccrypto-fever,\u201d where investors are so overcome with a fear of missing out they rush to contribute to new cryptocurrency projects as fast as possible, without checking for fake domain names.According to the report, large phishing groups are capable of stealing roughly $1 million a month.Cryptocurrency fraudsters are also getting more inventive. Group-IB found several instances of investor database theft, where hackers steal sensitive financial information to re-sell on the dark net or use to blackmail cryptocurrencers.Fraudsters are even building fake websites using stolen cryptocurrency project descriptions and plagiarized whitepapers, disappearing with investor funds shortly after launching a fake ICO.Group-IB predict attacks on ICOs will remain a threat for almost every project looking to attract investors.\u201cFraudulent phishing-schemes involving crypto-brands will only get more complex as well as cybercriminals\u2019 level of preparation for phishing attacks,\u201d the group warns. \u201cAutomated phishing and the use of so-called \u2018phishing-kits\u2019 will become more widespread, including for the attacks on ICOs.\u201dOminously, Group-IB also floats the possibility of the world\u2019s largest mining pools becoming an easy target for state-sponsored hackers, declaring attempted \u201851-percent attacks\u2018 to be increasingly common.For 51-percent attacks to be successful, bad actors must control a majority of the total computing power utilized by a Proof-of-Work powered blockchain.\u201cIn 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,\u201d Group-IB reports.\n                                    Published October 19, 2018 \u2014 10:53 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 19, 2018 \u2014 10:53 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
