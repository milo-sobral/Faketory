Heine will continue to serve as the nation\u2019s head of state.The decision to vote was realized after eight senators accused Heine of\u00a0ruining the nation\u2019s reputation with her idea of a state-backed cryptocurrency.Straight after the vote, RMI finance minister Brenson Wase reportedly confirmed the government\u2019s intent to launching the Sovereign, pending it meets requirements set by regulators from the US, Europe, and\u00a0the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The Sovereign was first revealed at the start of the year, when government ministers announced it would issue a new digital cryptocurrency via initial coin offering (ICO), intended to be used as legal tender.But just last month, the IMF warned Heine to ease off on launching the Sovereign, or face being cut off from the US dollar altogether, which RMI uses to access critical monetary meant to curtail spiralling inflation.To date there has been little evidence for Heine giving up on the idea of a sovereign cryptocurrency any time soon, and surviving today\u2019s vote could only bolster her confidence \u2013 that is, until the IMF catches wind of these results.\n                                    Published November 12, 2018 \u2014 16:42 UTC\n                                \n                                        November 12, 2018 \u2014 16:42 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
