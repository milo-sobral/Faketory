Most of the announcements we anticipated ahead of time, and it\u2019s a bit of a disappointment we\u2019re not going to get Airpower mats any time soon. But still, Apple delivered on some impressive-looking devices.Here\u2019s everything Apple showed at today\u2019s event.Those sweet cool gadgets?The company opened with an ode to the Mac. CEO Tim Cook revealed it\u2019s reach an active install base of 100 million Mac users, 51 percent of which are new buyers. And, according to him, it\u2019s time for a \u201cnew Macbook Air.\u201dThe new\u00a0Air will come with a 13.3\u2033 Retina display, with a 4 million-pixel resolution. The aluminum bezels are also being replaced with narrow black glass. It\u2019ll also have a Touch ID sensor built into the keyboard, like Apple\u2018s handheld devices. Apple also promised the device will have better processor and storage options, along with a more stable keyboard and larger trackpad. Despite all of these new features, it\u2019ll weigh only 2.75 pounds.The new Macbook Air will be available in three new finishes, starting at $1199. It\u2019s available to order starting today, and to buy starting next week.Read more:\u00a0Apple is finally updating the MacBook Air with a Retina displayCook, who looked like he\u2019d had entirely too much coffee this morning, next revealed a \u201csmall but mighty\u201d Mac device \u2014 the new Mac Mini, available in a sexy new space grey finish.The company touted the better processors, in particular quad-core and 6-core options, which apparently makes the new device five times faster than before. It will also be available with up to 64 GB of memory, and starts with 128 SSD in storage.Starts at $799. Like the Macbook Air, it can be ordered today, and will be available next week.Read more:\u00a0Surprise \u2013 Apple\u2019s Mac Mini has a new color and higher specsAs expected, the new iPad Pro was the darling of the event. Coming in both 11 and 12.9 inch variants, it\u2019s 5.9 millimeters thin, a full 15 percent thinner and 25 percent smaller than its predecessor. And, as expected, it now has Face ID replacing the Home button.Due to the lack of a button, it uses the gestures from iPhone X. It runs on the A12X Bionic chip, with graphics apparently comparable to an Xbox One S. It\u2019ll also come packed with magnets that allow users to attach their Apple Pencil and the new folio keyboard, which can also be charged wirelessly when attached.And, as expected, they\u2019re moving to USB-C, making them the first Apple devices to do so. This means the iPad Pro can be hooked up to a number of new devices, and even used as a charge port for a phone.The 11-inch model is available starting at $799, and the 12.9-inch at $999. They\u2019re both available to order today and will arrive in Apple stores on November 7.Read More:\u00a0Apple unveils new iPad Pro with tiny bezels, Face ID, and USB-CIn addition to the\u00a0hardware,\u00a0Apple\u00a0also announced it\u2019d be adding 60 new sessions to its \u201cToday at\u00a0Apple\u201d in-store teaching programs. According to Angela Ahrendts, head of retail, the sessions will include video and music editing, photo labs for kids, and special photo, video and music labs for teachers.In addition, the Apple Store app will now show users events at the Apple store closest to them, and can be tailored by which devices they own.Tim Cook also took a moment to introduce the latest iOS update, which will be released today. The most notable changes with the update are the new Group Facetime and 70 new emoji. The latter means we\u2019re finally getting the emoji\u00a0revealed back in July, which includes new emoji for red hair, grey hair, and no hair, along with a lettuce, a peacock, yarn, and a cupcake.That\u2019s everything, aside from a performance by a nervous Lana Del Rey. Hopefully we\u2019ll see more of the new iMac some time next year, since we got no teases this time around.\nRead next:\n\n        D'Angelo slipped a brand new song into Red Dead Redemption 2    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
