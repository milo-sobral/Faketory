The trade volume of Tether-based pairs has hit new lows, with October\u2019s data indicating the missing volume has actually flowed into Bitcoin pairs.\u201c[\u2026] Traders have now become more amenable to the volatility of Bitcoin rather than risk holding Tether,\u201d Diar notes. \u201cTrading volume of USDT pairs have dropped by a whopping 25 percent from the 15 October \u201cpeak crisis\u201d and 17 percent down from the start of the month on Binance.\u201dWhether or not this is a temporary trend is unclear \u2013 but it certainly goes against the narrative of a cryptocurrency community desperate for regulated stablecoins.Well, they\u2019re here and they\u2019re underwhelming.I can\u2019t help but think the lacklustre reception has something to do with the outrageously unsettling backdoors built specifically for police that are present in regulated stablecoins.Last time I checked, Satoshi Nakamoto didn\u2019t build a \u201cgod mode\u201d for police in Bitcoin.\n                                    Published October 24, 2018 \u2014 10:51 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 24, 2018 \u2014 10:51 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
