But where do these leaks come from?Jane Wong is a 23-year-old studying software engineering at UMass Dartmouth, currently taking a gap year in Hong Kong. Her hobbies include travel, photography\u2026 as well as reverse engineering and chasing bug bounties. She\u2019s responsible for some huge scoops from tech giants, including Facebook, Google, and Instagram. It\u2019s called Hard Fork.Scroll through Wong\u2019s Twitter, and you\u2019ll see feature after feature, leak after leak \u2014 Gboard\u2019s new Material Design for search cards, Facebook\u2019s notification page is getting a redesign, Messenger is getting a dark mode\u2026Gboard is testing the new Material Design for search cards pic.twitter.com/tPsufLJNKq\u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) October 23, 2018There are many reverse engineer hobbyists out there, but Wong works independently, and for no money. She\u2019s even turned down job offers from tech publications looking for her to exclusively snoop for them. How does she do what she does? And why?Reverse engineering is the process of deconstructing and then recreating a platform or program, and in doing so revealing its structure as well as possible weaknesses.Wong reverse engineers\u00a0apps to find out what features tech giants have been testing recently Most famously, she was the first to leak Facebook\u2019s dating feature \u2014 publications such as Engadget, TechCrunch, and Verge were all fast to pick up the story behind her.From the looks of her busy Twitter feed, she often publishes multiple leaks a day. Despite claiming she only does it when she has free time, Wong\u2019s output makes her seem like a machine.When we asked her about her workflow, and how she manages to stay ahead of the rest, Wong replied that her methods were somewhat \u201cscientific\u201d: \u201cIt is an iterative work on top of past knowledges and experiences. I would say my methods could be pretty\u00a0scientific\u00a0(i.e. Observation, Hypothesis, Experiments). It\u2019s pretty similar to how other security researchers made the exploits possible.\u201d\u201cI observe how the app and the operating system works programmatically, and how the company seemingly operates structurally, and how its people operate psychologically. I then try to make sense between the different observations and find their weaknesses\u2026 and then come up with hypotheses of how to make it worse. I then test to see of those work. If something interesting comes up, I usually tweet it out.\u201dShe only leaks the big stuff, skipping single letter casing changes or minor alterations to UI layout. Sometimes she finds weaknesses, which many a bad actor could happily exploit: \u201cIf I found something that has to be fixed, I usually report it to bug bounty programs. For instance, I found\u00a0a vulnerability that could have been used to dox Facebook employee\u2019s identities, that got fixed before disclosing.\u201dWhile Wong remains relatively low-key in the tech community \u2014 her Twitter followers are around 6k \u2014 this can open her up to others trying to steal her work: \u201cThere were a few incidents where I caught individuals plagiarizing/freebooting my scoops\u2026\u00a0freebooting\u00a0as in downloading the screenshots and reposting it, with little to no citations, and without adding any additional contribution (e.g. news articles, or at least blog posts with their own thoughts/insights) on top of it.\u201dWong doesn\u2019t let it dissuade her from continuing her work: \u201cI think there are better things to focus on than those individuals, but I called some out on Twitter (which is still visible on my tweet history). Some would add only the minimum amount of citation possible, and then tell people to follow their profiles or join their Facebook Groups for scoops they did not find.\u201dWong is currently still a student, but when she graduates she hopes to find a job at one of the platforms she reverse-engineers. For now, her work is for fun:\u00a0\u201cIt feels like going on an adventure, like treasure hunting\u2026 To me, my reward is to be able to see what\u2019s new, what\u2019s coming next.\u201dIt may be just a hobby, but reverse engineers like Wong are changing the tech industry.\u00a0TechCrunch\u2019s Editor-At-Large,\u00a0Josh Constine, told Inside recently:\u00a0\u201cApp researchers like Jane may force tech\u00a0companies to announce new\u00a0features as soon as they start testing them instead of when they\u2019re ready to launch.\u00a0Tipsters in the past typically had to have inside knowledge of\u00a0companies \u2014 they either were or knew employees, partners, or\u00a0investors. By digging into\u00a0apps, researchers can find irrefutable evidence of new experiments from outside the\u00a0company.\u201dJane Wong hosted a TNW Answers session with us on October 24th.
