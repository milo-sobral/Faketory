But lately, some of them have been working on innovative projects that will accommodate more users. One of the most interesting of these comes from Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba, which introduced a smart display technology to help the visually impaired with shopping and payments on their phones.As per a TechCrunch report, Alibaba\u2019s R&D wing, Damo Academy, collaborated with China\u2019s Tsinghua University to develop a cheap silicone sheet with sensory buttons that go on top of a smartphone display. The sheet \u2013 which costs just 3.6 cents to produce \u2013 has three small buttons on each side; you can press them to perform actions like \u2018Confirm\u2019 or \u2018Go back\u2019 while using supported apps.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainCurrently, the smart film works with special versions of Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce app\u00a0Taobao and Alipay, its mobile payment service. The buttons on the film have different functions in each app.\u00a0Right now, The research team is testing and refining the product with volunteers. It is also working on making the technology device-agnostic. The film will launch officially early next year.\u201cWe thought, human-machine interaction can\u2019t just be for sighted people. Besides voice, touch is also very important to the blind, so we decided to develop a touch feature,\u201d said Chen Zhao, research director at Damo Academy. \u201cUnlike with regular apps, it\u2019s hard to beta test Smart Touch because the blind population is relatively small.\u201dAlibaba doesn\u2019t intend to make money by selling its smart film; instead, the company will distribute it for free via its brick-and-mortar outlets.Many tech companies are taking up projects to help the visually impaired take advantage of smart devices to improve their lives. Google\u2019s Lookout app helps people \u2018see\u2019 things around them using their phones; Mircosoft has an app called Soundscape that assists people in getting around a city through audio cues.More ideas like this, please.\nRead next:\n\n        Moonday Mornings: AT&T and T-Mobile sued by victims of sim-swap cryptocurrency thefts    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
