I wanted to get into the proper holiday mood, and we all know nothing does the trick like a good ol\u2019 data analysis and visualization. Not here exactly, but on our new hardware site Plugged.The US spends $9 billion each year on this second highest commercial holiday, so I thought it\u2019d be interesting to find out how topics such as haunted places, spirits, and mysterious creatures have been ingrained in various cities \u2014 and to find the \u2018spookiest city\u2019 in the US!Aarrrrrgh! Aarrrrrgh! Aarrrrrgh! That was my poor attempt to set the mood for this spooky study. Now, let\u2019s first understand the data, our goals and then, I\u2019ll move to the visualizations.The data used for this analysis was extracted from Shadow Lands which has a great index of haunted places. Locations where \u201cghosts and hauntings\u201d have been witnessed are included in the list and people can report new sightings through the website \u2014 which is surely an extremely accurate and scientific method. I\u2019m looking to get to the bottom of the \u2018spookiness\u2019 question for Halloween\u2019s favorite country, the US, so our data set is only focused on the 11,000 haunted places listed in the US, which all include the following data fields:So, what exactly are we planning to uncover? Check out the following to understand:Let\u2019s get cracking then.Out of 4,356 cities listed on the site, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Honolulu are the ones that have the highest number of haunted places. I used the \u2018city\u2019 data field present in the data set to arrive at the number of occurrences and created the chart given below to show the top 30 cities.Coming back to LA, the following locations have the most number of references: \u2018Boyle Heights\u2019, \u2018Loyola Marymount University\u2019, and \u2018Occidental College\u2019. Specifically, Hollywood has 25 references and Universal Studio features twice in this list. So be careful out there.Let\u2019s now find out the number of haunted places for each state. The chart given below shows that California, Texas, and Pennsylvania are the states with the most number of haunted places. If you\u2019re afraid of ghosts, then you might want to move to Montana, Delaware, or Alaska as they are the least haunted states in the US.We have already found out the \u2019spookiness\u2019 of the states and cities based on the number of haunted places (which is of course 100 percent factual and based on years of scientific research). However, visualizing the data on a map adds further clarity. So, in this section I\u2019ll create a heatmap of the United States by using the latitude and longitude data in conjunction with the count of the haunted places.Oh wow, this is really scary.Clearly the East Coast is more haunted than the West Coast and the Southern US is more haunted than the Northwestern US. On the West Coast, only Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle are comparatively spooky \u2014 looks like most ghost are former tech entrepreneurs. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now it\u2019s clear where spooky things happens, but how is it spooky?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this section I want to find out the most frequently used words present in the description text of the dataset. I used text mining techniques available in R (programming language for statistical computing and graphics) to create the following word cloud which shows the top 300 terms.It is evident that words such as \u2018night\u2019, \u2018people\u2019, \u2018old\u2019, \u2018see\u2019, \u2018house\u2019, \u2018ghost\u2019, \u2018room\u2019, \u2018building\u2019, \u2018room\u2019, etc. are prevalent. Some of the interesting elements are the following:Although we figured out the frequently used words, it\u2019d be much more insightful if we could find out the relationship between the words used in the description texts. I\u2019ll take the help of tidy data framework for text mining via R to produce the visualization.Here we will focus on bi-grams (a pair of consecutive written units) and visualize the relationship via network graph. Bi-grams are particularly interesting since they allow analysis of sequence of words and their underlying connections.This network graph shows some interesting connections. For instance, there\u2019s a cluster of words related to soldiers and civil war. This means there are bunch of haunted places that have originated from the mayhem and death caused by civil war. Close by are the words \u2018wal\u2019 and \u2018mart\u2019 \u2014 I wonder what they mean\u2026The larger cluster at the bottom associates ghost with haunt, hunters, and stories (what a surprise). We also see words such as shadowy, ghostly, and dark are associated with figures, which is connected to walking. Interesting to note that at the top the word poltergeist (noisy ghost) is associated with paranormal activity. This makes sense because apparently they are capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people. Poltergeists are also associated with levitation of objects which definitely counts as paranormal activity.This sums up our little Halloween voyage via data visualization. I don\u2019t know about you, but this was just the thing I needed to get into the holiday mood.We saw that California is the spookiest state which houses the spookiest city, i.e., Los Angeles. Apart from that we uncovered the frequently used words and their underlying connections.
