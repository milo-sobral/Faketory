Speaking at an event in India\u2019s capital of New Delhi, he said that the company has to carefully consider use cases for the edit button before making it a reality \u2013 and it could potentially be tooled to help fix typos.\u201cYou have to pay attention to what are the use cases for the edit button. A lot of people want the edit button because they want to quickly fix a mistake they made. Like a misspelling or tweeting the wrong URL. That\u2019s a lot more achievable than allowing people to edit any tweet all the way back in time,\u201d Dorsey said.Hard Fork.He added that Twitter will ideally prevent unlimited editing, because then anyone could abuse the feature to alter their controversial or damning statements later on. Dorsey noted that the company wants to implement a solution that solves a problem and removes what \u201cpeople see as friction in the service.\u201d\u201cWe have been considering this for a while and we have to do in the right way. We can\u2019t just rush it out. We can\u2019t make something which is distracting or takes anything away from the public record,\u201d said the Twitter CEO.People have been asking for the edit button for a while.\u00a0Even Kim Kardashian got behind the cause recently, and asked Dorsey in person about it at her husband Kanye West\u2019s birthday bash \u2013 so you know it\u2019s a big deal.@jack Tweets, but editable? #PowerOf18\u2014 Ivan Mehta (@IndianIdle) November 12, 2018Feel* (tweets but editable)\u2014 Max Godin (@mxmgodin) November 10, 2018Tweets but editable @jack\u2014 Samuel Polay (@samuel_c137) November 11, 2018In 2016, Dorsey said that the company \u201chas been thinking a lot\u201d about an edit button for tweets,\u00a0but nothing came to fruition.Give us the edit button already, Jack!\nRead next:\n\n        US and Israeli politicians hacked to promote \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 cryptocurrency scams    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
