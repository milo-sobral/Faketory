We\u2019re actually a week behind this time; please bear with us while we get back on track next Friday.Whether you\u2019re into casual time wasters or hardcore shooters, you\u2019ll find something in here to exercise your thumbs with.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainLife is short. And one day, you\u2019ll be outta here. Heck, there\u2019s even an app that reminds you about it several times a day. But you\u2019re probably better off thinking about other stuff. We\u2019ve got a bunch of new Android games to get your mind off things.Blastlands is a fun casual top-down Battle Royale-style \u201c.io\u201d shooter which sees you start out as a human trooper, defeating enemies to collect scrap parts, leveling up and scoring better vehicles to add to your arsenal.The game is lightweight, fun and chaotic, matches start almost instantly, and with three game-modes; Free for All, Team Deathmatch, Domination, and a clan system coming soon, we can easily see this game competing with the likes of Battlelands Royale in the future.Get Blastlands on Google Play.This new title from Oddrok \u2013 the developer behind Power Hover \u2013 is a top-down singleplayer casual racing game with nine different cars and no upgrades or confusing in-game currencies (thank you!).While there are only 30 levels so far, each of them are well designed and challenge you by alternating between two objectives: beat the time, or pick up all the letters scattered across the course. I\u2019m really hoping Oddrok will add more levels and game-modes in the future, but this is is fun enough to try right now.Get Best Rally on Google Play.Fate of Nimi is a lovely new indie retro platforming adventure game with a polished art style that reminded us a bit of Sword of Xolan.\u00a0It also has\u00a010 infuriatingly difficult levels. I\u2019m talking really, really difficult!The simple control setup is easy enough to get used to, but you\u2019ll need some practice to master the odd jump mechanic. But overall, it\u2019s a promising new indie platformer that just needs more content to make your must-play list.Get Fate of Nimi on Google Play.Ending this list with a blast from the past, we\u2019ve got Cover Fire, which isn\u2019t exactly brand new (it was launched in 2016), but it remains one of the highest-rated third-person non-moving-around shooters (that\u2019s a term now, okay? :P) \u2013 and I genuinely enjoyed returning to it this week.With campaign, skirmish, and time-based events, the offline-playable shooter has you grind through levels with various characters, leveling up your skills in between missions, and increasing your base levels across all characters.Despite the graphics being a bit outdated, and the overall quality certainly not as high as online games like PUBG Mobile, Cover Fire is a decent offline shooter \u2013 as long as you can live with its energy system, which tries to limit our playtime (looking at you, mom!).Get Cover Fire on Google Play.Psst: If you want more great games, be sure to check out our previous roundups here.\nRead next:\n\n        Redefining commerce: The underappreciated, but growing prominence of online marketplaces    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
