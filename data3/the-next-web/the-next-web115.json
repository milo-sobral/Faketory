Covertly, without informing people.Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded.Similar to the practice in Windows 10, Microsoft has included separate software in the Office software that regularly sends telemetry data to its own servers in the United States.Basically, Microsoft gathers a ton of data on employees using the company\u2019s software, without letting them know, and doesn\u2019t provide the option to opt out.One of the biggest concerns of the report is Microsoft\u2018s use of the telemetry data, as Microsoft is pushing more and more services off premise. Up until now, Dutch governmental institutions have stored their content data locally, in their own data centers. But this is set to change.The Dutch authorities are conducting pilots with storing data on the Microsoft cloud, in SharePoint, and in OneDrive \u2014 along with testing out the web-only version of Office 365. Although Microsoft does collect data on individual use of its software in current set-ups, the DPIA show that the new methods come with \u201chigh data protection risks for data subjects.\u201dThe blog states that Microsoft has already made commitments to make adjustments to its software to accommodate privacy concerns, e.g. a telemetry data viewer tool and a new \u201czero-exhaust setting.\u201dWhile Microsoft\u2018s plans will hopefully help minimize the risk for its users, Privacy Company outlines six remaining high risks for data subjects:A Microsoft spokesperson told TNW that the company was committed to finding a solution to the concerns raised in Privacy Company\u2019s report:We are committed to our customers\u2019 privacy, putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws.We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a successful resolution of any concerns.In the mean time, Privacy Company recommends admins of the enterprise version of Office ProPlus in the Netherlands (although many of them should also be applicable to other countries) to take the following measures to lower the privacy risk for employees and other users:\nRead next:\n\n        Even artists are using Microsoft Excel, become a master of formulas for $19    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
