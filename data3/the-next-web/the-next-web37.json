It\u2019s incomprehensible that this isn\u2019t a globally recognized holiday, but nonetheless, we\u2019re here to help you celebrate this momentous occasion in gaming history.It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, Super Mario Bros. 3 is the greatest game ever made. That\u2019s a fact. If you\u2019re my age, it was the absolute peak of 1980s video game technology, and you were the perfect age to appreciate it. Nothing else was close. If you\u2019re older than me: whatever ancient Atari game you\u2019re thinking of isn\u2019t better. It\u2019s just not. And don\u2019t even bring up coin-op arcade games. Stop it. It\u2019s called Hard Fork.And if you\u2019re younger: get off my lawn. Just because your games play on virtual reality headsets that were science-fiction plot devices in ours doesn\u2019t make them better. Anything more than 8-bit graphics is a waste of \u2026 something. I forget and I need a nap. And it\u2019s cold.But, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not just a great game because critics named Tristan Greene, who work at The Next Web,\u00a0universally agree that if they could travel back in time and either buy stock in Amazon or play Super Mario Bros. 3 again for the first time, they\u2019d choose the latter. It was also the star of a great movie.My love affair with Super Mario Bros. 3 predates its 1989 US launch. In fact, like thousands of children at the time, I became interested in Nintendo\u2018s greatest game when it made its theatrical debut in the hit movie \u201cThe Wizard\u201d starring Fred Savage.In a time long before the internet, there were still surprises in the world. And at 10-years-old, since I couldn\u2019t afford Nintendo Power magazine, I managed to watch the movie without knowing what the \u201csecret unreleased game\u201d it was supposed to reveal was.I remember feeling sheer awe as I watched the end of the movie on my family\u2019s 19-inch TV. The big reveal came and there it was: Super Mario Bros. 3! They were playing Super Mario Bros. 3! At the time, it was only available in Japan.Without YouTube or social media (neither had been invented yet) or gaming magazines to thumb through, I\u2019d probably never lay eyes on so much as a screenshot until the game made its way to US shores. But there it was in defiance of expectation, in a movie, playing on my TV! The graphics looked other-worldly in glorious standard definition, and the gameplay looked like something from the future.Decades later my teenager spends hours a day watching other people play games on Twitch and YouTube, but \u201cThe Wizard\u201d was the OG experience of watching influencers game.There\u2019s never been another title that made me feel the same sense of anticipation and excitement as Super Mario Bros. 3 did, all thanks to Nintendo\u2019s ingenious Hollywood marketing scheme.\u00a0It\u2019d be hard to keep something like that a secret from today\u2019s kids though, due to instant, always-on news and updates.But it was a lot of fun being surprised by game makers when I was a kid, and Nintendo pulled off one of the greatest reveals in gaming history with Super Mario Bros. 3 \u2014 at least among 10-year-old poor kids in 1988.Happy Birthday to the greatest (your disagreements fall on deaf ears and blind eyes) video game ever made!\nRead next:\n\n        Dell's XPS 15 with 4K display is the laptop for people who want it all    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
