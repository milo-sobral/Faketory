If you\u2019ve ever wanted to see what goes on in the studio when the game du jour is being created, you\u2019ll find some of EA and DICE\u2019s Dev Talks fascinating.Members from DICE\u2019s sound design team were the focus of the latest episode of the behind-the-scenes shoot, and they revealed some of the stuff they do to get the in-game booms and bangs sounding just right.Visit Hard Fork.As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the devs said it was easier to find historical weaponry for this game\u2019s WWII-era gunplay than it was for\u00a0Battlefield One\u2018s WWI setting. And while they don\u2019t comment on it specifically, the foley work they do apparently includes multiple takes of things like putting a bare hand against a grip, or fiddling with different parts of the gun. The team also attempted to accurately recreate the sounds of the airplanes, like the infamous siren of the Stuka dive bomber.One major focus of the video is the attempt to capture the sound of the V-1 pulsejet-powered rocket historically used by the Luftwaffe. Essentially the audio team recorded a pulse engine attached to a snowmobile, and it looks rather dangerous given it could only be run a few times. But it\u2019s worth it to hear the distinctive roar as a rocket passes overhead in-game. It\u2019s the same one you can hear at this point in the reveal trailer, just before the player character is flattened by its blast.I can\u2019t speak for the entire game, but the sound design and audio looks solid. We\u2019ll know for sure when the game drops on its delayed date of November 20.\nRead next:\n\n        Violent videos put journalists at increased risk of post-traumatic stress    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
