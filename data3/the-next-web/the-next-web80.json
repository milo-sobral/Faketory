He was the greatest, most decent man.\u201dIt\u2019s in London from December 12-14For those somehow unfamiliar with his output, Stan Lee was the man behind several of Marvel\u2019s most popular characters. If you seen a popular movie in the last ten or fifteen years, it probably starred one of his creations. Along with legendary artists such as Jack Kirby, Lee created the likes of Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Daredevil, Black Panther, Doctor Strange\u2026 the list is long enough to keep you here for hours.Bob Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney company (which owns Marvel Comics), said in a statement:Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created. A super hero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain, and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart.Lee first started with Marvel \u2014 then called Timely Comics \u2014 as an assistant in 1939. One of his earliest creations that stuck in the public consciousness was The Fantastic Four, which debuted in 1961. His characters have remained a staple of popular culture ever since, renowned for their recognizable flaws and sympathetic personalities.In recent years, Lee is perhaps most recognizable for his multiple cameos in works based on his characters. Spotting him in Marvel movies has become a common pastime among fans, and he made a notable appearance in the PS4\u00a0Spider-Man game, released earlier this year.Marvel and others who knew him have been sending out their memorials:Today, we pause and reflect with great sadness on the passing of Stan Lee: https://t.co/J0cwgdn677 pic.twitter.com/eOBdZAqdZ0\u2014 Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) November 12, 2018There will never be another Stan Lee.
