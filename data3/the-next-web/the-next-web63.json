I used \u201clady language\u201d to undermine myself and I seemed to rely on emoji to \u201cjust\u201d portray my real opinions and emotions.It\u2019s difficult to break the habit of constantly apologizing \u2014 whether that\u2019s for when someone else walks into you or you\u2019re trying to chase someone via email.I found a Gmail plug-in offering a solution.\u00a0Just Not Sorry\u00a0warns you when you use words such as \u201cjust,\u201d \u201cI think,\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not expert,\u201d and \u201cactually\u201d \u2014 basically, words that serve no purpose other than to undermine your authority or discredit your skills and knowledge.The plug-in will underline said phrases or words in red. When you hover over the underlined phrases, the tool offers pop-up pearls of wisdom as to why you should amplify, and not undermine, your message.Just Not Sorry is part of a broader effort to encourage women to make their voices heard in the workplace.\u00a0The pop-up advice quotes experts experts including\u00a0Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a labor economist specializing in gender, and Tara Sophia Mohr, author of Playing Big: Practical Wisdom for Women Who Want to Speak Up, Create, and Lead. Gender inequality has had its influence on both women\u2019s and men\u2019s speech for centuries. A Gmail plug-in won\u2019t completely dismantle linguistic gender stereotypes, but pointing out simple words that unintentionally undermine certain voices is a step in the right direction.Sorry about this column, I\u2019m no expert at writing confidently.SUBSCRIBE\nRead next:\n\n        Put the 90s (and 900 games!) in your hands with the throwback glee of the RetroMini    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
