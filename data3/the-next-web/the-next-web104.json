Perhaps less obvious is how it\u2019ll change our sex lives.According to a new study by the Annals of Tourism Research, ditching the driver could open up a whole lot of doors for transit-related sexual activity. Scott Cohen, the deputy director of research at the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at the University of Surrey stated in the report that approximately 60 percent of Americans have already had sex in a car.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainBut with driverless cars, it might not just be the occasional quickie, or the awkward post-prom encounter. Driverless cars could actually be a boon for the sex industry.\u201cSex is part of urban tourism and commercialized sex is part of that too, so it is quite likely that autonomous vehicles will lead to prostitution, whether legal or illegal, to take place in moving autonomous vehicles in the future,\u201d Cohen, who lead the team behind the study, told NBC.Of course, sex tourism was just a small piece of the puzzle. Overall, the paper focused on ways that autonomous vehicles would impact everything from sleeping to dining in the near future. The report notes that roadside diners and hotels would probably be the most affected businesses in our soon-to-come, self-driving future.Cohen, though, doesn\u2019t think sex in autonomous vehicles is going to happen any time soon. It won\u2019t, he says, become a reality until \u201cthe 2040s.\u201dvia NBC\n\nAutonomous vehicles and the future of urban tourism\non Research Gate\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Tired of being a JavaScript ignoramus?
