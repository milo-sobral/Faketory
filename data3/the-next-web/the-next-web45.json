You\u2019ve probably seen the memes popping up for months from fans and celebs alike:*me after playing red dead redemption 2* pic.twitter.com/9nNNKGg3IH\u2014 Desus Nice (@desusnice) October 26, 2018It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainThe hype is deserved \u2014 it\u2019s been in development for eight years, thousands of people worked on it, and, as our own Nino de Vries wrote, \u201cit\u2019s generation-defining, it\u2019s bar-raising\u201d from its graphics to its gameplay. And its accompanying\u00a0soundtrack certainly keeps up.Even without D\u2019Angelo, it\u2019s an impressive playlist, with contributions from Arca, Colin Stetson, and Queens of the Stone Age drummer Jon Theodore.D\u2019Angelo\u2019s track,\u00a0\u201cMay I? Standing Unshaken \u2014 Oh Traveller Have a Seat,\u201d plays in the fifth chapter, between the \u201cParadise Mercifully Departed\u201d and \u201cDear Uncle Tacitus\u201d missions. Music fans were quick to spot it, including New York magazine\u2019s critic, Craig Jenkins.Holy fuck did Red Dead slip a new D'angelo song in?\u2014 Craig Bro Dude (@CraigSJ) October 29, 2018This is D\u2019Angelo\u2019s first release since his 2014 album Black Messiah, which, let\u2019s face it, was the best album released that year.Listening to the song, I\u2019m transported back to 2015, when I saw D\u2019Angelo and the Vanguard live at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens \u2014 the converted outdoor tennis courts were literally full of middle age women swooning. It was the best show I\u2019ve ever been to, as well as the closest thing to an orgy I have seen, and ever hope to see, in my life. I mean, try to watch this music video with your parents without regretting your own existence:Let\u2019s hope the track is a sign of more to come \u2014 an album, maybe?I don\u2019t write much about video games \u2014 actually, I haven\u2019t played one in years. But I do listen to music. A lot. And news that D\u2019Angelo slipped a new song into its soundtrack is enough to make me want to buy a copy.\nRead next:\n\n        Intel's AI strategy for 2019 goes beyond chips    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
