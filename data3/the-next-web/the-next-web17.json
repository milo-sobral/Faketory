It went under a year ago, because (shocker) not enough people were buying its $20,000 devices. But if that sounds like your idea of a daily driver, you\u2019re in luck: Vertu\u2019s back with a handset starting at just $4,200.The company is now hawking the Aster P, a 4.9-inch Android phone with 133-carat sapphire crystal glass, a titanium body, and a leather rear panel \u2013 you can choose from lizard or crocodile hide.It\u2019s certainly eye-catching, with its polished metal accents, large bezels, and gull-wing doors on the rear for its SIM card trays.Under the hood, you\u2019ll find a mid-level Snapdragon 660 processor paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB, a single 12-megapixel camera on the rear, a 20-megapixel selfie camera, and a 3,200mAh battery.Those specs aren\u2019t terrible, but that\u2019s certainly not the sort of hardware you\u2019d expect to see in a phone that starts at $4,200 and goes up to $14,120 for the gold variant. If you\u2019re not put off by those price tags, you can pre-order it in China from this page. It\u2019s worth noting that it comes with the aforementioned concierge service, so you\u2019ll probably need to ditch your existing one before switching phones.Via 9to5Google\n                                    Published October 19, 2018 \u2014 12:51 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 19, 2018 \u2014 12:51 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
