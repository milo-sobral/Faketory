He also sold special\u00a0Diamond\u00a0tokens that were supposed to be hedged by physical diamonds.Not only were both claims fake, but so were the tokens. There was never any blockchain technology powering either of them.\u201cThe calculated lies of Zaslavskiy and others led unsuspecting investors who thought they were purchasing cryptocurrency securities to buy worthless certificates,\u201d said US district attorney Richard Donague.The court documents also detail how Zaslavskiy declared RECoin to have a\u00a0\u201cteam of lawyers, professionals, brokers and accountants,\u201d and that 2.8 million tokens had been sold, when really only 1,000 investors had been tricked into purchasing the bullshit certificates.FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William Sweeney, commented that\u00a0Zaslavskiy and his goons dressed \u201cold-fashioned criminal schemes in the language of new currency\u201d in order to swindle cash from unsuspecting, newbie investors.The court also used this opportunity to issue a warning to the greater industry: simply labeling something a \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d does not magically transform it into a currency, and simply using this moniker does not allow projects to skirt the SEC\u2019s strict laws related to securities.Zaslavskiy now faces up to five years in prison. Further, the SEC also filing related civil charges against Zaslavskiy, which are to be settled following the court\u2019s criminal sentencing.\n                                    Published November 16, 2018 \u2014 11:18 UTC\n                                \n                                        November 16, 2018 \u2014 11:18 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
