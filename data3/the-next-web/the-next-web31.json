The aim? To enrich ourselves financially, and you spiritually.Here\u2019s a photo of the very large Chartres Cathedral:On this day all the way back in 1260, this magnificent French cathedral was consecrated in the presence of\u00a0King Louis IX. In other words, it was declared sacred \u2013 meaning it was formally dedicated to god.Good one, Louis!These days, it\u2019s a UNESCO World Heritage site, an honor it earned in 1979. The reason? Because it marks a \u201chigh point of French Gothic art,\u201d contains \u201cporches adorned with fine sculptures from the middle of the 12th century,\u201d and has \u201cmagnificent 12th and 13th-century stained-glass windows.\u201dEven better, it\u2019s all in \u201cremarkable condition.\u201d Great to hear,\u00a0Chartres Cathedral!I have a question though: if it\u2019s such a masterpiece, why did it take until 1979 for it to get UNESCO certified? With the organisation founded in 1945 that means it took\u00a034 years for\u00a0Chartres Cathedral to get proper recognition. Scandalous.While I can\u2019t say why it took so long, I know exactly what would\u2019ve got it\u00a0World Heritage status quicker \u2013 if they installed\u00a0a nine foot tall inflatable dragon that lights up.Observe, please, the majesty:Just look at it compared to a normal human male:Don\u2019t believe me? How about we do a thought experiment.Are you sitting comfortably? Good. Imagine you\u2019re a UNESCO representative. You hear about a cool cathedral. You think \u201cthat sounds nice, maybe I\u2019ll check it out in 34 years.\u201d Then \u2013 and this is the kicker \u2013 you hear this cathedral has a nine foot tall inflatable dragon that lights up. I guarantee you\u2019ll be on the first plane to France\u00a0to declare it a World Heritage site.Basically, this dragon will improve the class and status of any situation \u2013 whether you\u2019re looking for an internationally recognised award or not.And you know what\u2019s even better? You can currently save $40 on this breathtaking beast, making it only\u00a0$109.99.What are you waiting for? Why are you still reading?
