For the record, there has been a total of 171 mines blocked since the chain first split.The most concerning development is that it appears both newly-spawned Bitcoin Cash forks are currently losing from the split.Most exchange services have temporarily halted Bitcoin Cash trading until consensus has been reached about the hard fork, but chances are both cryptocurrencies will experience a significant drop in price.To make matters worse, miners are validating transactions at a loss. According to estimates from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, both chains are losing about $500,000 in opportunity cost each day. (It should be noted some of those estimates might not be entirely accurate.)In the meantime, exchanges are still mostly sitting on the sideline, waiting out to see which chain it makes more sense to support in the long run. Of course, some exchanges like (Binance and the controversial Bitfinex) have already announced intentions to support both implementations.So who is really winning the Bitcoin Cash war? It is difficult to say \u2013 but neither side seems willing to concede defeat.Logging off for the day. No more updates to my article (https://t.co/01r9sza3n3) or the @BitcoinMagazine Twitter feed.TL;DW so far: BCH split in 2, ABC chain much longer and more valuable on (futures) exchanges. No 51%-attack. ABCers feel victorious, SVers don't concede defeat.\u2014 Aaron van Wirdum (@AaronvanW) November 16, 2018Anyone interested in a more detailed explanation of the Bitcoin Cash network split ought to head to our extended breakdown.\n                                    Published November 16, 2018 \u2014 15:42 UTC\n                                \n                                        November 16, 2018 \u2014 15:42 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
