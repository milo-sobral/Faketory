Admittedly, Twitter doesn\u2019t offer the level of granular control as, for example, Facebook. But it does have some decent options for controlling what other users can see and what level of access they have to you.Here\u2019s a quick primer on your Twitter privacy settings, and what they mean. Note these will be sorted based on the browser version, rather than the mobile app, but the settings are the same across devices. It\u2019s called Hard Fork.This is the obvious place to control your privacy, listed under \u201cPrivacy and safety\u201d in Settings.The first and most obvious setting is \u201cTweet privacy.\u201d This gives you the option of setting your whole account to private. If you do, then you must approve all new followers before they can see your tweets. Tweets from protected accounts can only be seen by followers, and won\u2019t show up in third-party search engines like Google\u00a0(barring shenanigans with third-party apps, but we\u2019ll get back to that in a moment).The next is \u201ctweet location\u201d which varies between devices. On browsers, this means a general location will be attached to your tweet, indicating where you were when you tweeted. On mobile devices, the option is called \u201cprecise location,\u201d and enabling it allows Twitter to access your GPS in order to, as the name suggests, use your exact location. In both cases, Twitter can use your location to serve you up local ads. You also have the option to \u201cDelete location information\u201d that Twitter has already collected.The next three settings, \u201cDiscoverability,\u201d \u201cPhoto Tagging,\u201d and \u201cTwitter for Teams\u201d can be taken as a whole, given that they do roughly the same thing; They allow you to control how much other users can involve you. \u201cDiscoverability\u201d controls whether others can find you by searching for your email address or password. \u201cPhoto Tagging \u201d lets you list who can tag you in photos: anyone, people you follow, or no one. \u201cTwitter for Teams\u201d \u2014 which allows users to create groups of users who can access their account without a password \u2014 gives you the same choices.Finally, you\u2019ll find your settings that control Direct Messages. From here, you can enable the option to \u201cReceive from anyone\u201d and to turn on\u00a0Read Receipts. Both are essentially what they sound like, though we recommend leaving the former option disabled unless you have a good reason to enable it \u2014 Twitter DMs can be weird. On the mobile app, you also have the \u201cQuality Filter\u201d which allows Twitter to filter out messages it deems of lower quality, though it doesn\u2019t specify how it deems DMs to be of low quality.These settings are more for controlling sensitive tweets, both the ones you create and the ones you see. \u201cSensitive\u201d in this case, refers to those containing pictures or videos of graphic violence or adult content. Twitter allows such tweets, though \u201cexcessively\u00a0gruesome media\u201d and anything depicting the moment of a person\u2019s death is subject to removal.Twitter allows users to both block sensitive media and mark something they\u2019re about to post as sensitive from this section.\u00a0For example, Safety is where you\u2019ll find the option to exclude sensitive tweets, as well as blocked or muted accounts, from your searches \u2014 meaning these two options together constitute the closest thing Twitter has to a Safe Search.You also can enable the option to \u201cDisplay sensitive content\u201d which makes that kind of media visible by default. You can also \u201cMark media you Tweet as containing material that may be sensitive\u201d if that\u2019s the sort of thing you regularly tweet.This page, which is accessible from within the Privacy and Safety menu, allows you to control how much of your information Twitter itself is allowed to use. Most of the options are fairly self explanatory \u2014 personalized ads, or sharing your data with Twitter\u2018s business partners, for example.One option that\u2019s less clear-cut is \u201cPersonalize based on your devices.\u201d Essentially, this controls whether Twitter can use data it collects from one device to personalize another, and it incorporates data from third-party sites with Twitter integration. If you enable this option, Twitter can use this information to serve you up ads based on things you\u2019ve done on other devices and sites. Here\u2019s an example it gives:\u2026if you commonly use Twitter for Android around the same time and from the same network where you browse sports websites with embedded Tweets on a computer, we may infer that your Android device and laptop are related and later suggest sports-related Tweets and serve sports-related advertising on your Android device.While not strictly related to privacy and security, there are a few other settings which you should always keep an eye on for your own safety.For example, you should check Apps & Data now and then.\u00a0Apps, as the name implies, shows you which apps have access to your Twitter account, such as Instagram, Facebook, Buffer, or IFTTT. It also shows you the information to which each app has access. If you\u2019re the type of person to grant those permissions willy-nilly (no judgement, we\u2019ve all hit the \u201cAllow\u201d or \u201cYes\u201d button without really reading the warning at least once), it can be helpful to do a spring cleaning of these apps every once in a while.Devices shows you all of the devices currently logged in to your account \u2014 including both smartphones and desktop browsers.\u00a0You can log out of any of these sessions remotely from the device you\u2019re using to view the settings.The other setting would be \u201cBlocked accounts,\u201d which is, again pretty self-explanatory. You\u2019ll find a list of all the people you\u2019ve blocked since you\u2019ve been on Twitter, which can be helpful if you\u2019re a serial blocker and want to keep track of such things.Any other steps you take to keep a handle on your Twitter account?
