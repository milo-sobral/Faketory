Fittingly enough, it\u2019s one of the classier Wear OS smartwatches we\u2019ve seen to date \u2013 Mobvoi already has some solid entries under its belt \u2013 and it comes in at a relatively affordable price of $200.It\u2019s a pleasantly spartan design available in 18mm and 20mm wristband sizes, and it comes in rose gold, black, or platinum. Somewhat disappointingly, rose gold is only available on the smaller size; a rose gold watch with a blue strap is one of my favorite color combinations on my chunky wrists. That caveat aside, it\u2019s a good-looking device, and I really dig some of Mobvoi\u2019s analog watchfaces here.Otherwise, it\u2019s typical Wear OS fare. There\u2019s a heart rate sensor, a 400 mAh battery good for two days, GPS, and NFC for payments. Unfortunately, it\u2019s stuck on the years-old Snapdragon 2100 platform \u2013 just as devices are set to start shipping with Qualcomm\u2019s 3100 chips later this year.I dig the design, but that older chipset makes it a tougher pill to swallow. Then again, I\u2019ve never\u00a0really had problems with the older chipset\u2019s performance on recent versions of Android Wear and Wear OS; I mainly would\u2019ve appreciated the extra battery life from the more efficient hardware.You can pre-order the TicWatch C2 from Mobvoi\u2019s website starting today for $200; the watches will ship the first week of December.\n                                    Published October 24, 2018 \u2014 19:50 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 24, 2018 \u2014 19:50 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
