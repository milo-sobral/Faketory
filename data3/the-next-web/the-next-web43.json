Gadi Singer isn\u2019t one of those people. He believes DL is just getting started, in fact he says we\u2019re about to enter the next phase of AI, and deep learning at the edge is a huge part of that.He probably knows what he\u2019s talking about. After all most of the world\u2019s AI compute cycles are run on his company\u2019s architecture.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainSinger is Intel\u2019s Vice President, Artificial Intelligence Products Group Architecture General Manager. He has the difficult task of figuring out what to do next with the company\u2019s AI vision. Unlike Ray Kurzweil, Google\u2019s AI futurologist, Singer is more grounded in the nuts and bolts of his company\u2019s AI plans. So his predictions aren\u2019t for a faraway future: they\u2019re for 2019 and 2020.According to him, Intel\u2019s AI strategy\u00a0is a three-pronged approach that embraces all of machine learning. He says DL is just starting to mature beyond its infancy, so his company needs to be prepared to provide solutions for its practical use at the edge.When asked what that means for the field of AI, as a whole, he says \u201cIt is a next phase, it\u2019s the next phase.\u201dThe aforementioned three-point plan for the future is complex, but it breaks down to some pretty simple ideas:And that all sounds really corporate and fiscally responsible \u2013 or something \u2013 but, what exactly does it mean for Intel\u2019s customers? During our interview, Singer stopped the conversation to ask his own question:What architecture do you think most AI cycles are run on?The obvious answer, if you\u2019ve been paying attention for the past couple of years, is GPU. It\u2019s also the wrong answer, says Singer:It\u2019s not GPU, and I\u2019ll explain why. There\u2019s, basically, two different kinds of tasks in deep learning: training and inference. Nvidia has a lot of the training cycles. But the Nvidia discussion is primarily a training discussion. In 2015, we estimate, the ratio of inference cycles to training cycles was 1:1. Today it\u2019s 5:1 and moving towards 10:1 \u2026 Most inference tasks are run on CPUs, on Intel CPUs \u2026 Most AI compute cycles run on our architecture.Intel\u2019s vision for AI, specifically DL, in 2019 and 2020 involves ushering it out of the early experimental age and onto just about every physical object in the world. Intel wants its hardware in the hands of researchers, built into gadgets and wearables, and powering corporate and developer needs. Whatever you\u2019re doing with deep learning, Intel\u2019s plan is to provide a chipset and software environment that\u2019ll suit those needs.The path to 2019, and the \u201cnext phase\u201d of AI, was unclear just a few short years ago though. According to Singer, deep learning is responsible for a \u201cfaster\u201d and \u201cmore intense\u201d paradigm shift than any he\u2019s seen at Intel.As a response to this most recent wave of deep learning advances, Intel\u00a0has been gobbling up AI\u00a0startups such as Movidius and Nervana to push the limits of what it can do with AI chips. It\u2019s re-engineered its own CPUs from the inside out to provide more power for machine learning. And it\u2019s begun developing software solutions to tie its AI ambitions together.It\u2019s clear, based on what Intel\u2019s up to, that reports of deep learning\u2019s death are greatly exaggerated.
