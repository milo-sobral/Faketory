And, from what we\u2019ve seen, the changes are all positive.Stan Chudnovsky, VP of Messenger, describes Messenger 4 as a \u201cnew, simplified\u201d version of the app. It\u2019s shaving what has, up to now, been about eight or nine different tabs down to three. It\u2019s called Hard Fork.It\u2019s a much needed change, as Messenger has become ever more crowded over time. What started out as a dedicated app for Facebook\u2018s chat service\u00a0has since become a behemoth in its own right, and it now offers games, bot integration, video calls, and Stories. As each new feature has been added, it\u2019s essentially just been bolted onto the client with a new tab or bar.Between all of these features and the ads, it\u2019s a task just finding a message I sent to a friend two weeks ago. It\u2019s like trying to pull the rug from under a coffee table. So the news that the company is cleaning everything up comes as a relief.Under the new Messenger, all of your chats are in their own tab. Another tab is dedicated to \u201cPeople,\u201d i.e. Stories, a list of your friends currently active, and the ability to find further friends. The third is \u201cDiscover,\u201d which is basically a dumping ground for both bot integration and games.Chudnovsky noted there are further developments in the works, and teased a beautiful Dark Mode that intrigued me more than any other item in the list. These features will also roll out with Messenger 4, but at later stages.Messenger 4 will roll out to everyone over the next few weeks.\n\nSay Hello to the New Messenger: Introducing Messenger 4\non Facebook\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Alibaba wins copyright case against cryptocurrency knock-off    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
