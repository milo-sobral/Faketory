After only a few days on the market,\u00a0Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\u00a0has already made half-a-billion dollars \u2014 and yet apparently that\u2019s still not enough to impress some of the company\u2019s investors.According to Activision, the number of players over the opening week is a new record for the series, and it had more airtime on Twitch than any other game in the series. It was actually quite dizzying how many streamers were playing the game. Even seasoned Fortnite veterans in my follow list were taking up the\u00a0BlOps\u00a0banner. By all layman\u2019s metrics, the game is a success.It\u2019s called Hard Fork DecentralizedOne could argue the main reason for\u00a0Black Ops 4\u2018s instant success is its timely leap onto the battle royale bandwagon. From what I\u2019ve seen, the series\u2019 distinctive brand of polished\u00a0FPS combat mixed with the fast pace of the shrinking battleground. Honestly when I first heard the\u00a0company was making the BR leap, I was not particularly enthused, but it seems to have worked out in\u00a0CoD\u2018s favor.And yet\u2026Activision Blizzard stocks are taking a bit of a tumble. It doesn\u2019t look as though the market was particularly impressed with the sales. And though the numbers do sound impressive, it\u2019s worth noting that last year\u2019s\u00a0Call of Duty: WWII\u00a0also posted very similar numbers during its release window.\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0noted the drop and speculated that other releases in the same timeframe might have chipped away at investors\u2019 faith in the game\u2019s success. But there might be another factor.It\u2019s hard to imagine, given that it\u2019s been such a gaming mainstay, but\u00a0Call of Duty\u00a0is a fifteen-year-old franchise. The first game released in 2003, and the series really hit its stride as a cultural touchstone with\u00a0Modern Warfare. And it\u2019s been a consistent bestseller ever since. I\u2019ve known some gamers in my life who bought and played each year\u2019s\u00a0CoD\u00a0iteration and nothing else. Each game has, to my knowledge, done such incredible sales that hearing that\u00a0BlOps 4\u00a0has done the same isn\u2019t terribly impressive.If investors were expecting the latest game to improve on the success of\u00a0Call of Duty: WWII, then that might explain the stock drop. Even though the game is apparently smashing records all over the place, at least according to Activision, if it\u2019s showing the same numbers as\u00a0WWII, then it\u2019s no surprise investors are reacting with a metaphorical yawn.Regardless, Activision isn\u2019t done with the property yet. According to\u00a0Rob Kostich, the series\u2019 GM, \u201cThere\u2019s much more to come, we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\nRead next:\n\n        It's only a matter of time until terrorists use AI as a weapon    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
