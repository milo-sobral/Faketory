It\u2019s set to be OnePlus\u2019 most ambitious device to date, with pre-launch coverage pointing to a smaller notch, and in-display fingerprint reader, and official carrier support via T-Mobile.But then Apple announced it was hosting an event the same day.For all of OnePlus\u2019 popularity, it\u2019s still no Apple. Making matters worse, Apple\u2019s event would be held in New York, meaning a lot of journalists would potentially have to double up on coverage. So OnePlus did the best it could do when dealt with a bad hand \u2013 it moved the event up by one day, to October 29.In a blog post, OnePlus\u2019 Pete Lau said the decision wasn\u2019t taken lightly, but it ultimately made the most sense. Journalists would have to divide their attention, and chances are OnePlus would get the short stick.Also of note, unlike Apple\u2019s event, OnePlus\u2019 is open to fans as well, and some bought tickets to fly into New York for the launch. Lau says those fans can apply for a refund to their flight tickets or hotel dates.As one of the many tech journalists who has to cover both events, I have one comment: Thank God.\n                                    Published October 19, 2018 \u2014 19:58 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 19, 2018 \u2014 19:58 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
