The official unveiling will follow that of the company\u2019s Galaxy S10 flagship in February. Samsung hopes to sell a million units of its foldable handset.Yonhap noted that alongside the Galaxy F, we\u2019ll also see a 5G-capable version of the S10 in March.If the report is accurate, the Galaxy F will be one of the most expensive phones you\u2019ll be able to buy from a mainstream brand next year; it\u2019s nearly double the price of the biggest phones of 2018, and there aren\u2019t likely to be many devices that will bridge the price gap in the few months left until next March. Yes, there are pricier models already, like this $2,700 doodad, but those are for crazy people.Still, it\u2019s no surprise that a product with a brand-new technology will initially only attract enthusiastic early adopters, and be priced accordingly.We don\u2019t know much more about the Galaxy F, but Samsung did reveal that it sports a 7.4-inch screen when unfolded, and have a 4.6-inch display like a regular smartphone when folded. At an Android Dev Summit event, Samsung Mobile engineering director Jisun Park noted that the unfolded screen will have a resolution of 1536 x 2152 pixels, at 420 dpi.He added that the idea is to use the phone in its folded state for quick tasks, like making calls, reading messages, and looking up maps; when unfolded, the device is said to allow for a seamless experience that expands the functionality of the apps you use, and support multiple windows simultaneously (for responding to messages while watching YouTube side-by-side, for example). Android will soon natively support foldable devices, so hopefully this will all work as advertised.All eyes will be on the South Korean giant next year to see if it can make foldable phones a thing; if this doesn\u2019t pan out, Samsung can continue to make expensive flip phones that are, for all intents and purposes, foldable, and call it a win.\n                                    Published November 12, 2018 \u2014 10:48 UTC\n                                \n                                        November 12, 2018 \u2014 10:48 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
