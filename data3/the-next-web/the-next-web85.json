But the company is known to announce new designs shortly after launch, and now it\u2019s bringing a gorgeous \u2018Thunder Purple\u2018 to North America and Europe.The new colorway was first announced in China last week, leading many fans to hope it\u2019d make its way west.\u00a0 The color features a subtle gradient that fades from black to purple. Like some of the company\u2019s other devices with a frosted-glass finish, a multi-layer design creates a cool \u2018S-Curve\u2019 effect as you move the phone around in the light.The Phone will only be available in the 8GB+128GB configuration but mercifully costs the same $579 as the other black finishes. You\u2019ll be able to purchase one starting 9AM\u00a0ET on Thursday, November 15.If you ask me, this is OnePlus\u2019 best color yet, and one that doesn\u2019t look too much like other phones on the market. That said, I\u2019m still waiting for the day OnePlus makes a blue phone. A man can dream.\n                                    Published November 12, 2018 \u2014 16:30 UTC\n                                \n                                        November 12, 2018 \u2014 16:30 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
