It\u2019s called Hard Fork.An Irish man was acquitted of rape charges last week during a trial that centered on whether his 17-year-old accuser consented to their sexual encounter. The accused alleged the girl was a willing participant and that he wasn\u2019t even sure intercourse actually took place due to his erectile dysfunction.Over the course of the trial, jurors heard evidence that, immediately after the encounter, the 17-year-old said to the accused \u201cYou just raped me.\u201d His reply, reportedly, was \u201cNo, we just had sex.\u201dDuring her closing remarks, the attorney for the accused, Elizabeth O\u2019Connell, implored jurors to consider the way the child was dressed as evidence of her consent:Does the evidence out-rule the possibility that she was attracted to the defendant and was open to meeting someone and being with someone? You have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front.Outraged by the implication that wearing a certain type of underwear indicates a person has given their consent to a sexual act, women around the world are posting pictures of their panties in protest.Jurors in Cork were asked to consider the underwear a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL was wearing when she was raped by a 27-year-old man.Join the cause in solidarity, can\u2019t believe this girl was subjected to these comments after such a traumatic event.#ThisIsNotConsent #Ibelieveher pic.twitter.com/PfkYERulgY\u2014 Courtney Peterson (@_courtneymaria) November 13, 2018Most of my underwear has lace on it. This doesn\u2019t mean I want to be raped. No matter what I wear, no means no!! #ThisIsNotConsent pic.twitter.com/dUBaA702oS\u2014 Cl\u00e0udia \ud83c\udf97\ufe0f (@catalanaalcor) November 14, 2018Irish politician Ruth Coppinger took to the floor of the Dail \u2013 parliament, for the rest of us \u2013 on Tuesday to bring the issue up before the assembly.I hear cameras cut away from me when I displayed this underwear in #D\u00e1il. In courts victims can have their underwear passed around as evidence and it's within the rules, hence need to display in D\u00e1il. Join protests tomorrow. In Dublin it's at Spire, 1pm.#dubw #ThisIsNotConsent pic.twitter.com/DvtaJL61qR\u2014 Ruth Coppinger TD (@RuthCoppingerTD) November 13, 2018A government review of rape trial procedures is reportedly underway in Ireland but, as social media has shown, the issue isn\u2019t just a local one.In fact, fifteen years ago in Scotland, 17-year-old Lindsay Armstrong took her life after she was forced to hold up her own panties during her rapist\u2019s trial. Her mother, Linda Armstrong, told BBC News Scotland earlier this year:It\u2019s quite sad that there is still plenty of chance for people to go through what Lindsay went through. I feel like they are not taking it seriously enough.The conversation about consent is no longer avoidable by citing a case-by-case basis and ignoring uncomfortable questions, thanks, at least in part, to the endless reach of social media. And the\u00a0idea that some people are \u201casking for it,\u201d likely won\u2019t survive intelligent discourse.As Irish Prime Minister Leo Vradkar put it:Nobody asks to be raped. And it\u2019s never the victim\u2019s fault. It doesn\u2019t matter what you wear, it doesn\u2019t matter where you went, who you went with, or what you took \u2014 whether it was drugs or alcohol.\n\nCounsel for man acquitted of rape suggested jurors should reflect on underwear worn by teen complainant\non The Irish Examiner\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Report: People are going to have a lot of sex in self-driving cars    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
