This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t. Anything less is a sham.\u201dGDPR has shown us all that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone.\u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 24, 2018Tim Cook has long been an advocate for better data protection standards and his support of GDPR in today\u2019s talk \u2014 the EU\u2018s ambitious regulation which was introduced earlier this year \u2014 further cements his stance.Support for better data privacy from the leader of one of the world\u2019s biggest companies is certainly move in the right direction as it could clear the way for similar legislation in the US \u2014 which Google and Facebook have been less keen on.Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn\u2019t want to do great things. It doesn\u2019t want anything. That part takes all of us. We are optimistic about technology\u2019s awesome potential for good \u2014 but we know that it won\u2019t happen on its own.\u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 24, 2018However, I\u2019d advise against viewing Tim Cook as some saint-like figure, stepping off his pedestal to shower the poor masses with better data privacy. Apple\u2018s business model is fundamentally different to that of the other tech giants, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s been able to stay on the sidelines while Cambridge Analytica-type storms hit its \u2018competitors\u2019.Facebook and Google are actually in the advertising business \u2014 turning personal data into money \u2014 while Apple makes its buck by selling hardware. It\u2019s easy to see why Cook might then grab the chance to have him seen as a righteous tech leader, as it doesn\u2019t cost him or his company much, and he gets the added benefit of seeing Zuckerberg and Pichai squirm when they speak later today at the conference via video.But what do all tech giants have in common with each other, but not so much with us persons? Not paying taxes.Tim Cook underscored the need for trust in tech to help it reach its full potential, but how can we trust tech giants when they don\u2019t pay their fair share?Only two years ago, Cook wasn\u2019t so zen about EU policy when the union ruled that Apple would need to pay a whopping \u20ac13 billion in owed taxes in Ireland, as the country had given illegal tax benefits to the company.Tim Cook had an elegant reply ready to go when he heard the news: He said the ruling was \u201ctotal political crap.\u201dI\u2019ve argued before that in order to build trust in tech, we need to be certain that big tech plays by the same rules as others do; that\u2019s why EU\u2018s Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, who\u2019s a great tax enforcer was my tech person of the year in 2017.Her motto is society needs to be served by technology and not the other way around \u2014 and she\u2019s acted on it. During her term, the EU has repeatedly gone after seemingly untouchable companies and made sure innovation isn\u2019t hurt by unfair competition \u2014 which roused the ire of Tim Cook and other tech leaders.Hopefully, Tim Cook will continue his streak of being a champion of the people by not only calling for better data privacy regulation, but also by advocating for better tax practices by big tech companies. Trust in tech can\u2019t be built when companies abuse our personal data, nor can it when tech companies steal from the public by not paying taxes.I\u2019ll salute you, Tim Cook, for taking the right stance on privacy \u2014 as soon as Apple stops avoiding taxes.\nRead next:\n\n        Spanish authorities want citizens to disclose all their hodlings    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
