Who would have expected that?A draft-law that effectively forces cryptocurrency hodlers to make themselves known, put forward by Spain\u2019s Ministry of Finance, was approved on the 19th October, local news, ABC Economica reports.Of course, Spanish cryptocurrencers can\u2019t be forced to reveal themselves, but they\u2019ll be breaking the law if they don\u2019t.The new law is mainly aimed at tax avoidance and will force Spanish hodlers to tell the government who they are, and how much cryptocurrency they posses \u2014 also in off-shore accounts.However, there\u2019s one potentially welcome caveat for the casual trader; you\u2019ll only need to declare assets if your cryptocurrency holdings are valued at over $57,000 (\u20ac50,000).If you\u2019re a Spanish citizen and a serious trader though, it looks like there is no hiding your cryptocurrencies \u2013 legally, at least.Sounds like it might end up being another nail in the cryptocurrency coffin.\n                                    Published October 24, 2018 \u2014 12:26 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 24, 2018 \u2014 12:26 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
