Today, we learned that it would be Nick Clegg, former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and one-time leader of the Liberal Democrats.Nick Clegg\u2019s formal title will be\u00a0VP of Global Affairs and Communications. According to the BBC, he\u2019ll start working at the company next week, and will relocate with his family to California next year.Those sweet cool gadgets?I don\u2019t think anyone saw this coming. When Recode published a speculative list of potential candidates earlier this month, Clegg was nowhere to be seen among the former British political heavyweights. Instead, it suggested more plausible names like former UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, David Miliband, and one-time Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne.Furthermore, Clegg also has an image problem. He lead the Liberal Democrats during its brief stint as the minority partner in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. Many people \u2014 particularly young people \u2014 felt betrayed, and eight years on, few have forgiven him.Given Facebook\u2019s public perception woes, it wouldn\u2019t have been blamed if it opted for a less controversial figure, like Miliband, or perhaps IMF chief Christine Lagarde, as was suggested by Recode\u2019s Kurt Wagner.Despite that, I\u2019m convinced that Facebook\u2019s picked the top man for the job. For the first fifteen years of Facebook\u2019s life, it moved fast and broke things. Now, as battles with regulators and governments are reaching a fever pitch, it\u2019s time for a grown-up to take the reins.Nick Clegg is unreservedly that grown-up. He\u2019s a natural and instinctive diplomat. During his five years as the minority partner in the 2010-2015 coalition government, he delicately balanced the interests of his party and voters, while simultaneously ensuring that government continued to run smoothly.Despite holding just 57 seats, the Liberal Democrats delivered on many of their manifesto promises (although controversially failed to stop a rise in tuition fees). This was accomplished without the government collapsing in acrimony, as is often the case in coalition governments.This delicate hand will undoubtedly come in handy as Facebook navigates the aftershocks of Cambridge Analytica, the Brexit referendum, and the 2016 US general election.There\u2019s another reason why Clegg is ideally suited to Facebook\u2019s Global Policy job: he\u2019s an enthusiastic Europhile who understands the complicated machinations of the European Union.The Lib Dems are passionate believers in the European Project. Clegg backed Remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum and remains a vocal voice in favor of a People\u2019s Vote on the final deal. Crucially, Clegg sat as a Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2004.As Facebook locks horns with European Union regulators over issues such as privacy and security, Clegg\u2019s experience and understanding will prove to be an invaluable asset.Although few people could have predicted Facebook hiring Nick Clegg for one of its most important roles, looking back, it makes perfect sense.\nRead next:\n\n        Samsung's Galaxy Book 2 is like a Surface Pro with up to 20 hours of battery life    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
