May doesn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201cWhat I see is losses of hundred of millions in some programming screw-ups, thefts, frauds, initial coin offerings (ICOs) based on flaky ideas, flaky programming, and too few talented people to pull off ambitious plans,\u201d May told CoinDesk. \u201cSorry if this ruins the narrative, but I think the narrative is fucked.\u201dMay highlights how sheer interest and hype surrounding blockchain has got every man/woman and his/her dog developing some kind of use for the supposedly decentralized tech. But when this happens, the tech becomes inherently more centralized.\u201cPeople and companies are trying to stake-out claims.\u201d May continued, \u201cSome are even filing for dozens or hundreds of patents in fairly-obvious variants of the basic ideas, even for topics that were extensively-discussed in the 1990s\u201dUsing blockchain to posture for competitive advantage couldn\u2019t be any further from what it originally set out to achieve. As May put it, \u201cSatoshi would barf.\u201dMay might have a point here. A recent study showed China\u2019s control of Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate. Another study found only 16 percent of cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized. Then there are the seemingly weekly announcements of yet another bank using blockchain.All of which create a centralized and controlled reality, contrary to the original visions for Bitcoin.\u201cRemember, the excitement about [Bitcoin] was mostly about bypassing controls, to enable exotic new uses like Silk Road. It was some cool and edgy stuff, not just another PayPal,\u201d May said.The lengthy interview is worth a leisurely read; find it over on CoinDesk.\n                                    Published October 19, 2018 \u2014 11:14 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 19, 2018 \u2014 11:14 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
