The case was denied by judges on the grounds that US district courts did not have jurisdiction over ABBC \u2013 which claims to be based in Dubai and Belarus.Since then, Alibabacoin Foundation has stepped even further over the mark. According to reports, ABBC continued to use Alibaba\u2019s branding and trademarks to promote its ICO and cryptocurrency.Alibabacoin Foundation was using the unlicensed materials to try and raise $3.5 million in an ICO. The coin has a current market value of $1.9 million.The injunction prevents ABBC from using any materials, terms, marks, designs, words, and terms belonging to Alibaba.If ever there is a reason not to trust the promotional materials of a cryptocurrency on first sight, this is it.It would be quite reasonable (for the uninitiated) to assume Alibabacoin is affiliated to the mega-successful Alibaba corporation \u2013 but it\u2019s not. Any company that uses stolen copyright material isn\u2019t one to trust in my books.That said, it\u2019s not like Alibaba has never been used to sell knock-off goods before\u2026\n                                    Published October 24, 2018 \u2014 10:46 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 24, 2018 \u2014 10:46 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
