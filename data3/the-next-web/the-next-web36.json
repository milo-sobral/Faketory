We knew the latest iteration of the highly-anticipated laptop would be good, but once we got our hands on one it was clear it\u2019s among the best.The unit we reviewed was a regular XPS 15 laptop, not the 2-in-1 version. Otherwise it had most of the top specs for the model, including the excellent 4K Infinity Edge touchscreen display.The XPS 15 starts at $999.99, but the configuration we reviewed comes in at a slightly more gulp-inducing $2,099.99. If you can deal with half the RAM and a 1080p non-touch screen, you\u2019ll save a bunch of money. But you\u2019ll have a slightly less complete experience.To get an idea of who this laptop is designed for, let\u2019s dive right into the specifications:This thing is a beautiful beast. It\u2019s fast enough to replace your desktop (in fact, it\u2019s one of the few laptops I\u2019d argue can replace all but the most high-end users and gamers\u2019 desktops), the screen is good enough for professional photographers to edit with, and it can play Fortnite at a silky-smooth 60FPS at the top settings. Aesthetically, it compares well to the LG Gram.Credit: Nicole GrayThe XPS 15 is a bit thicker and twice as heavy, but this is one of the sleekest powerhouse laptops you\u2019ll find. If you plop this thing down in a group of people who are unfamiliar with its pedigree, with the lid closed, they might think you have one of those cool lightweight devices that eschews power and practicality for low-cost and easy portability.They\u2019d be dead wrong.The XPS 15 can do it all. And it becomes pretty apparent this isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill device once you open it up and power it on. The unit I reviewed was an ode to the kind of excess that seems wasteful to some and necessary to others.Do you need an Nvidia 1050 GTX graphics card in a laptop that\u2019s obviously trying to catch the eye of the professional crowd? No, you don\u2019t. But it sure is nice to fire up The Witcher 3 in between meetings.And do you really need your 4K display to be a touchscreen? No, you don\u2019t. But it sure is nice to scroll through Netflix by dragging my fingers on the screen like I\u2019m on a phone or\u00a0tablet, then watch Stranger Things in glorious 4K resolution\u00a0the way it was meant to be seen.The Infinity Edge display from Dell may not be the technical marvel it would have been two years ago with it\u2019s near bezel-free design, but it produces images better than any I\u2019ve seen in a laptop sans Apple\u2019s. You simply have to see it to believe it but, even at 400 nits brightness, it\u2019s a delight to behold at its full battery life-sucking intensity. And it\u2019s quickly become my favorite screen to view 4K videos, TV, and movies on, period.Performance-wise, it\u2019s monster-iffic. It can handle Photoshop and Chrome and a dozen other programs being open at the same time. The 8th gen Intel i7 processor operating at 2.2GHz and 16GB of RAM are more than enough to handle almost any software that doesn\u2019t require a specialty-computer. As far as business, office, or what I\u2019d consider to be \u201cday-to-day professional\u201d use is concerned: throw your desktop away and get this thing.As far as processor speeds go, Digital Trends has it neck and neck with the Razer Blade and the Macbook Pro. In my experience, each one excels at something the other doesn\u2019t, but the XPS 15 might be the best total package.I won\u2019t get into a deep dive of the specific benchmarks, but I will say that it\u2019s the fastest Windows 10 laptop I\u2019ve used when it comes to launching programs and performing routine functions. I\u2019ve seen less of the Windows hourglass with this than any other laptop running Windows 10 I\u2019ve used.I definitely think it compares nicely to the Razer Blade when it comes to performance outside of gaming. But, if gaming is an important consideration when it comes to choosing a new laptop, it\u2019s worth pointing out\u00a0Dell\u2019s own G3 Gaming Laptop is less expensive and seems to perform just as well in that department.Overall, I\u2019d consider other options if gaming were my primary concern. Especially since you won\u2019t be able to make use of the 4K screen with most games anyway.Credit: Nicole GrayIt is, however, perfectly suited for editing video and photos. The touchscreen brings some interesting options to the editing process \u2014 though you should banish thoughts of controlling Photoshop with a specialty pen directly on the screen.It\u2019s touchscreen sensitivity is perfect for using it like a tablet, but professional photographers are going to want to use an external input device for fine-grain editing. More important is the quality of the display.Its rich and vibrant color profile doesn\u2019t rely on blowing out the brightness to make images pop, and that means it\u2019s a more \u201cfair\u201d\u00a0display when it comes to showing your unedited work. It also means that it handles blacks well enough to make watching horror movies in 4K simply delightful.So, if you ever stop working and use it for R&R, it\u2019s a decent enough reason to upgrade your Netflix account to 4K. Everything looks a little better on the anti-glare screen, though your optical delights do come at the cost of extended battery life. You\u2019ll be getting around half the performance out of the XPS 15\u2019s larger-than-average battery with the 4K screen than you would with configurations featuring the 1080 screen.It\u2019s not that bad \u2014 I got about 7-8 hours between charges with fairly heavy video and software use. It was enough to make it most of the day without plugging in, and luckily the included charger isn\u2019t of the bulky variety so it\u2019s not a pain to travel with.There\u2019s a lot of little things to like about the XPS 15 as well. The slightly-grippy surface surrounding the keyboard is appreciated as long-term use can lead to slightly sweaty hands and wrists \u2014 a little grip goes a long way.I was also pleasantly surprised by the keyboard. I tend to hate laptop keys because I prefer some travel, and they usually have very little \u201cclickiness.\u201d This one is an exception. While it still doesn\u2019t have a lot of travel, the keyboard does feel somewhat clicky and responsive. I didn\u2019t mind using it for entire work days, but in the end I\u2019d still prefer to connect a mechanical keyboard. The touchpad is fantastic, it functioned flawlessly during my testing.Credit: Nicole GrayOn the negative side, there\u2019s a few problems with the XPS 15 that belie its status as an elite machine for professionals \u2026 who need a 4K screen \u2026 and also like to game. Chief among those issues is the placement of the webcam. It\u2019s smack dab in the crease of the machine so it always has a perfect view up your nostrils.People who don\u2019t want to show off the under-side of their chin may need to connect an external webcam to use with this device, or just take video calls on their phone. I despise webcams and video chatting, so it\u2019s not a problem for me. For what it\u2019s worth the picture from the webcam is crisp and clear.Another issue I had was with the speakers. On the plus side they do get loud enough to watch movies in a somewhat noisy environment, and they\u2019re tuned well enough that you won\u2019t constantly have to change the volume to maintain a listenable experience. But, otherwise, they manage to pull of the rare feat of having both\u00a0slightly tinny highs and slightly flat lows.This is possibly due to the shell design and speaker placement. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they don\u2019t sound bad, just underwhelming for a package that\u2019s otherwise exemplary. It shouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker unless you have no external speaker or headphone options.Those caveats aside, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend another 15-inch laptop over this one, especially as a desktop replacement. Apple fans can shrug knowing it doesn\u2019t matter to them, but other power users will be hard-pressed to find a better combination of lightweight aesthetic, price, and performance.Stay tuned for our upcoming review of the XPS 15\u2019s littler sibling, the XPS 13.We like some products.
