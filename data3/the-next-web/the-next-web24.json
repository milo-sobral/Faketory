Dubbed \u201cNew California,\u201d the free add-on works with PC versions of the game, and it\u2019s available for download now.Don\u2019t feel bad if you weren\u2019t aware of New California. This fan-made project was created by Brandan Lee, Rick Hukkanen, and other members of the modding community. It\u2019s not an official product published by Bethesda. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not incredibly impressive and worth playing.It\u2019s in London from December 12-14The game was developed over a period of seven years as a learning experience for creators Lee and Hukkanen. According to a FAQ on the mod\u2019s page at ModDB:XII. Why did you make this game-sized mod?We wanted to learn how to make our own games. What better way is there than to make a game-sized mod first?The Fallout series is known for its huge, sprawling maps. In a way, the location of each game acts as a main character. With New Vegas, the titular city looms ever-present as you navigate a narrative that\u2019s intrinsically thematic. New California, from what we\u2019ve seen, also manages to provide a unique backdrop for post-apocalyptic adventure.In sheer scope, its map is about 2/3 the size of New Vegas. There are some 17,000 lines of dialogue in the game, recorded by more than 60 voice actors. This isn\u2019t a basement-project that simply adds a few new quests.It actually adds nearly 50 new quests as part of a completely new single-player campaign that casts you as a survivor from Vault 18. There are other changes, including a more statistics-based dialogue system and an increased emphasis on player choice. Long-time fans of the series will be happy to know that New California also features two fully-voiced radio stations with a wide array of Fallout-appropriate music.On initial observation New California looks amazing. But we\u2019ll hold off on declaring it a worthy follow up to Obsidian Entertainment\u2019s effort until we\u2019ve had more time to go hands on.However, since it\u2019s free, it\u2019s definitely worth a try. You will need a copy of Fallout New Vegas, you can get it on Steam for $9.99. Once you have the game, you can then navigate here for information on downloading and installing the New California add-on.\nRead next:\n\n        Sony warns gamers could lose saves, progress, DLC access after changing PSN name    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
