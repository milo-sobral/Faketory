Now that same feature is coming to Chrome on the desktop.The feature has technically been available for a couple of months in the Chrome 69 beta, but Chrome 70 makes PiP public.Visit Hard Fork.It works like this: Open a video, right click on it, and select picture-in-pitcure. Your video will be transferred to a floating window.. You can resize or move it to your liking, and it will remain on top of all your other apps and windows as you go on about your business.The only caveat: Developers have to enable the feature first. Still, with YouTube Support already available, I imagine it won\u2019t be long until other video providers follow suit.The feature is available with Chrome 70 on Windows, Mac, and Linux now. Ironically, it\u2019s not quite rolled out to Chrome OS yet, but I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be long.Via Android Police\n\non Google\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        An entrepreneur's guide to Mexico City's tech scene    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
