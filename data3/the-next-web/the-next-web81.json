Something wholesome and harmless, yeah?But thus far,\u00a0Fallout 76\u2018s run on the market is plagued with bugs that are honestly getting a little difficult to laugh off. First we had that situation where the whole beta was mysteriously deleted for some users. Now, perhaps with a touch of irony from the universe, some players can\u2019t get rid of the beta no matter how hard they try. It\u2019s called Hard Fork.As reported by\u00a0VG247, PC beta players on Reddit began to notice an interesting problem with the Bethesda launcher. Namely, every time they tried to uninstall the beta, they were told they didn\u2019t \u201chave access to this game.\u201d The pop-up also says to be sure you\u2019re signed in with the account \u201cassociated with the purchase of this game.\u201dNaturally, this made some users say, \u201cHang on a minute\u2026 purchase?\u201d \u2014 taking this to mean they won\u2019t actually be able to delete the game unless they pay for it. That said, even some players who did buy the game report they still can\u2019t uninstall the beta.I\u2019m assuming these are the \u201call new spectacular issues\u201d Bethesda promised when it launched the beta. At least, I sincerely hope even if the former users are right (and purchasing the game does make the beta uninstall-able) that this is a bug and not a passive-aggressive way to try and make sure all beta players purchase the game.There\u2019s also a chance this issue will vanish when the beta officially ends with the release of the game on November 14, when the servers go live, although we won\u2019t know for sure until November 14. Either way, the fact this beta doesn\u2019t seem to want to leave is fitting.via PCGamesN\n\nFallout 76 beta can\u2019t be uninstalled unless bought\non VG247\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Stan Lee, comic book writer extraordinaire, has died    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
