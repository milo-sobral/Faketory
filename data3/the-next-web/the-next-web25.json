The self-regulatory status allows the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association to police exchanges for any violations, Reuters reports.It appears the decision was made in response to the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market.\u201cIt\u2019s a very fast moving industry. It\u2019s better for experts to make rules in a timely manner than bureaucrats do,\u201d a senior FSA official said in a briefing.The FSA\u2019s approval will allow the industry association to define the rules and safeguards that local cryptocurrency exchanges must satisfy in order to operate legally. However, the association will also be responsible for enforcing and policing any rules it implements.The self-regulatory status allows the industry association to make and enforce regulations without needing government approval. So the cryptocurrency market isn\u2019t being left entirely to its own devices.While this might allow the association to react quickly as the market develops, whether or not this approach will be successful remains to be seen.Japanese netizens have been some of the worst affected by cryptocurrency hacks, having lost over $540 million in the first half of this year. That\u2019s without even mentioning the whole Mt. Gox saga.\n                                    Published October 24, 2018 \u2014 15:43 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 24, 2018 \u2014 15:43 UTC\n                                    12 - 14 DECEMBER - ALL OVER LONDON Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
