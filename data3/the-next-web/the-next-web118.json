TechCrunch reports that a database of text messages containing more than 26 million 2FA codes, password reset links, and delivery tracking details was left out in the open \u2013 and its recipients may have been compromised.Security researcher S\u00e9bastien Kaul Kaul discovered the database \u2013 owned by a telephony firm called Voxox \u2013 on Shodan, a search engine for public databases. It was also attached to Voxox\u2019s subdomain with an easily searchable frontend. You could use it to easily find phone numbers, names, and text messages.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainVoxox provides SMS-based APIs that converts code into text\u00a0messages to authenticate users. TechCrunch found that the exposed databased contained messages to authenticate phone numbers for Trivia HQ and Viber, verification codes for Huawei accounts, password reset codes for Microsoft accounts, Yahoo account keys, and Amazon shipping tracking links.According to Dylan Katz, another security researcher who reviewed the findings, the data might have already been snapped up and used by malicious third parties.The firm took the database down after TechCrunch contacted it. Voxox\u2019s co-founder, Kevin Hertz, said in an email that the company is looking into the issue and evaluating the impact of the incident.We have sent an email to the company to learn more and will update the post accordingly.Exposed databases are a real concern for user privacy, especially for companies who handle sensitive information.\u00a0Last week, we reported that American Express India\u2019s database, with information about more than 700,000 of its cardholders, was publicly readable for more than five days in October.\nRead next:\n\n        Cryptocurrency fraudster faces 5 years in prison for selling fake ICOs    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
