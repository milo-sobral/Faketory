This (currently) five part feature should provide you with a very basic understanding of what AI is, what it can do, and how it works. The guide contains articles on (in order published)\u00a0neural networks,\u00a0computer vision,\u00a0natural language processing, algorithms, and artificial general intelligence.\u00a0There are few technologies that inspire the imagination like artificial intelligence. And, in the field of AI, the Holy Grail is living machines.It\u2019s our cool new gadget site.The quest to imbue machines with the spark of life is an ancient one. The golem of Jewish folklore is an early example of an automaton, as well as Pygmalion\u2019s Galatea. But, rather than bring machines to life, we\u2019ve so far only imitated intelligence.Modern AI, mostly, appears in the form of deep learning. Computer vision, natural language processing, and other machine learning-based technologies have revolutionized the field, seemingly overnight, but it\u2019s hard to cut through the hyperbole and figure out what\u2019s really going on.You\u2019ll hear and read a lot of different terms being thrown around to describe concepts that seem the same, with few people able to explain the differences. Worse, the experts using these terms often quibble over their definitions.To clear things up, we need to sort through the nomenclature. The term artificial general intelligence (AGI) is, perhaps, the most popular one for the concept. But there are many others:And there are even terms for machines that are more intelligent than humans: superintelligence and super-intelligent AI (SAI).If having several terms for the same idea wasn\u2019t difficult enough, there\u2019s no actual consensus anywhere on exactly what any of these terms mean. So, if you\u2019re reading this and getting red in the face over the author\u2019s misuse of a term you clearly know means something different: welcome to the regular conversation.Some researchers believe AGI \u2014 we\u2019ll just go with that term \u2014 can be achieved without a machine necessarily being able to do everything a human can (intellectually speaking). Others have a much stricter definition that says all AI is weak unless it can demonstrate consciousness.And, of course, there\u2019s a distinction between general intelligence and sentience. Many\u00a0experts are content to think an autonomous contraption that requires no human input to perform a variety of tasks which imitate human-level intelligence (think: a robot that can charge, repair, and upgrade itself but doesn\u2019t feel emotions) clears the bar for AGI, but not for sentience or life.The counter-argument to that sentiment is: the human brain may be nothing more than a big neural network, and consciousness is a by-product of its robustness. Sentience, some experts claim, is merely a side-effect of the brain\u2019s function. This might sound counter-intuitive, but there\u2019s plenty of research to support it:So sentience, consciousness, or \u2018being alive,\u2019 might not be something we can explain yet in humans or robots. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s beyond the realm of possibility that we\u2019ll figure it out tomorrow, a year from now, or in 2029 like famous futurologist Ray Kurzweil thinks.It even seems reasonable to theorize that AI will become sentient not by design, but as a by-product of the development of more advanced neural networks or some machine learning paradigm that hasn\u2019t been invented yet.At the end of the day (today, at least) defining what AGI actually is might not be the most pressing matter for the general public. Because, no matter what terminology we use, it hasn\u2019t been achieved yet.It\u2019s probably fair to say\u00a0nobody is even close to giving a machine human-level intelligence. To use a popular theoretical benchmark: there\u2019s no robot that could walk into your house today and make a pot of coffee using your appliances and dishes. AI simply isn\u2019t powerful enough for that kind of intense decision-making yet.However, cars can already drive themselves, and you can buy a flying camera that pilots itself today. Those are narrow, or weak AI \u2014\u00a0meaning they\u2019re only designed to do one or a handful of specific things within certain parameters. But it won\u2019t be long before someone designs a machine that Frankensteins a hundred or so amazing narrow AIs together in a seamless package. Arguably, that\u2019s what Sophia\u2019s creators are trying to do.Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET and the person responsible for Sophia the robot\u2019s AI, compares the state of AGI research today to the period when the first automobiles were being designed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even reached the Model T stage yet, but I think we will soon,\u201d he told TNW.And, if Sophia is the precursor to the robot version of a Model T, you have to wonder what the AI equivalent of a Tesla would look like.A few years ago AGI was considered a niche line of research. It was the fodder of professional futurologists like Google\u2019s Ray Kurzweil and philosophers like Oxford\u2019s Nick Bostrum. These days, it\u2019s seeing heavy investment and is considered a lucrative and rewarding field to work in.Just a handful of the companies and organizations deeply involved in AGI development include:And that list could also include dozens of startups and hundreds of universities such as MIT, NYU, and Oxford. The development of a human-level artificial intelligence isn\u2019t science fiction, it\u2019s a business strategy.The bottom line is that AGI, in the limited sense of machines that can operate completely autonomously while performing a series of specific tasks that require human-level intelligence, is something most experts in the field would likely agree is attainable if not inevitable.Whether or not that aforementioned spark of life \u2014 the \u201cNumber Five alive!\u201d moment from the movie \u201cShort Circuit\u201d \u2014 ever happens, or is even possible, remains a mystery.Here\u2019s some of our favorite TNW articles featuring the subject of AGI:And here\u2019s a few resources for when you\u2019re ready to dive a little deeper:Don\u2019t forget to check out our Artificial Intelligence section for the latest news and analysis from the world of machines that learn.\nRead next:\n\n        Facebook's former PR firm seeded fake stories about bias at Apple News    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
