The entry-level Macbook is getting its first refresh in nearly a decade.First up, the Air is finally getting a Retina display. And it\u2019ll be 17% smaller (less volume, as Apple described it) weighing 1/4 lb less than the previous Air. The display also ditches the Air\u2019s giant silver bezels for a slick, nearly edge-to-edge coverage. It now displays over 4 million pixels, 48 percent more color, and a new look.It will also feature Touch ID, with the sensor built into the keyboard, enabled by an included T2 security chip \u2014 both appearing for the first time in the MacBook Air lineup.Other announced new features: better speakers and enhanced audio. The Air is also getting a three-microphone array, specifically to make it easier for Siri to hear you.Specs:The new MacBook Air goes on sale next week, starting at $1199.\n                                    Published October 30, 2018 \u2014 14:21 UTC\n                                \n                                        October 30, 2018 \u2014 14:21 UTC\n                                    Remarkable progress\u2122Thank you!\nCopyright \u00a9 2006\u20142018.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with \u2665 in Amsterdam.\n"}
