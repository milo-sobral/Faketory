Last year, Apple was forced to apologize to consumers after it admitted throttling the performance of older phones. According to the company, this was to prevent unexpected shutdowns on phones with batteries that had degraded with use.In response, Apple said it would temporarily lower the cost of battery replacements, and give punters better tools to gauge battery health.The decision to fine Samsung is a bit of a puzzler, as the performance impact of its updates hasn\u2019t attracted nearly the same level of criticism as Apple\u2019s. When it comes to the Korean giant, the most significant area of contention is the relatively slow pace in which it updates users to the latest-and-greatest version of Google\u2019s mobile operating system. This is common across most smartphone manufacturers, and has lead to fragmentation across the Android landscape.Regardless, \u20ac10 million and \u20ac5 million for Apple and Samsung respectively is nothing. It\u2019s chump change. Assuming both companies don\u2019t immediately contest the ruling, they\u2019ll easily be able to absorb this hit and carry on as if nothing happened.\n\nItalian watchdog fines Apple, Samsung over software updates\non Reuters\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Score NordVPN, one of the most highly rated VPNs, for a limited time discount    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
