Twitter has been locked in a perpetual grappling match with hate groups clinging to the fringes of society \u2014 those most often responsible for creating vitriolic content \u2014 for some time now. What is surprising, however, is seeing Twitter amplify the message itself.Visit Hard Fork.Credit: BuzzFeed NewsFirst spotted by BuzzFeed News, the Trending Topic made a brief appearance lasting 10 minutes or so for the users who saw it. And not everyone did. The topic, reportedly, only appeared in the sidebar of some\u00a0New York residents\u2019 feed.The phrase, recently, has been the subject of discussion after a Brooklyn synagogue was vandalized prior to the appearance of Broad City\u00a0co-creator Ilana Glazer. An unknown person, or persons, littered the synagogue with anti-semitic graffiti, such as \u201cdie Jew rat,\u201d etchings of \u201ciset oven here\u201d (presumably meant to be \u201cinsert\u201d), and at least one mention of \u201cHitler.\u201d A NYPD spokesperson confirmed the message contents.\u201cThe phrase should not have appeared in trends, and we\u2019re sorry for the mistake,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis was trending as a result of coverage and horrified reactions to the vandalism against a synagogue in New York. Regardless, it should not have appeared.\u201dThis follows the killing of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue just one week prior.For Twitter, it\u2019s a one-off screwup, an algorithmic error that pushed a popular news story into Trending Topics, as it\u2019s designed to do. But it couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.Human editors, which Twitter employs, should have prevented the mistake from happening at all. So, while it might not be worth breaking out the pitchforks and torches just yet, it is worth questioning whether Twitter is doing enough to prevent this type of thing from happening in the first place.\nRead next:\n\n        Watch: US Navy shoots down a (fake) nuclear missile in space    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
