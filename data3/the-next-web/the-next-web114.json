Truly, the holiday season is upon us. And you know what this means? Gifts. Lots of gifts.Whether you\u2019re putting together your own list, or trying to find the perfect thing to get someone else, we\u2019re here to help. We\u2019ll be running a range of difference gift guides over the coming weeks, but this is our first: the ultimate guide.Basically, this is a selection of some of our favorite stuff in the world. It\u2019s brimming with items we couldn\u2019t live without and we think you\u2019ll feel the same.Here we go!On the lookout for a portable bluetooth speaker? Well, I\u2019m happy to say your search is over.The UE BOOM 3 is the best around \u2013 it\u2019s tough, waterproof, stylish, and reasonably priced. Sound-wise, it handles all music genres (and podcasts) with aplomb. Plus, it can get\u00a0loud.The battery lasts for ages and it\u2019s small enough to just slip in your bag when you go out. You can also turn it from across the room using your phone, which is a blessing for the lazy person.Please never leave us, UE BOOM 3, you\u2019re too beautiful.Price: ~$130Amazon | Best Buy (US) | Currys (UK)This was a tough one. There are a lot of brilliant premium headphones out there (shout out the Sennheiser HD1 and the Sony WH-1000MX2), but the Master & Dynamic MW50+ have captured my heart. I couldn\u2019t imagine not having them in my life.The build quality is brilliant. They\u2019re bluetooth, but you have the option to use a wire if you dig the headphone jack. Plus \u2013 you can also change the headphones to be either on-ear or over-ear.And the sound, oh lord, the sound. Rich, precise, and with enough oomph to make even the most mundane tracks exciting. You can\u2019t go wrong with the Master & Dynamic MW50+. Get them for yourself or your loved one and everyone will be happy for years.Price: ~$400Amazon | Best Buy (US)Weed\u2019s everywhere these days. It used to be something you did hidden away, but the legalization movement has swept the globe. And, just like attitudes towards the plant has changed, so has the way we consume it.One of the most popular \u2013 and in my mind best \u2013 is the humble vape. Over the past few years, this technology has gone from bulky and inefficient, to slick and premium. And in this market, the Pax 3 is the best.It\u2019s simple to use, portable, and delivers a great high. And did we forget to say it\u2019s also a bit of a looker? If you\u2019re looking to switch up your marijuana habit, check out the Pax 3. It comes\u00a0highly (get it?) recommended.Price: ~$200Namaste Vapes | Everyone Does ItIf you\u2019re curious about VR, the Oculus Go is the perfect introduction. It\u2019s a standalone headset (and controller) that can take you to a virtual world quickly.I\u2019ve spent a lot of fun hours with the Oculus Go and almost everyone I\u2019ve shown it to has been impressed. No, it\u2019s not the same VR experience as an expensive computer-bound headset, but the Oculus Go is accessible, entertaining, and an ideal gift for someone wanting a gadget that\u2019s a bit different.Price: ~$200Amazon | NewEgg (US) | Currys (UK)Finally, the Apple Watch has delivered. The past iterations of the smartwatch have been good, but Apple has hit its stride with this generation.Aesthetic-wise, it\u2019s a thing of beauty \u2013 everything about it screams quality. The battery life is better than ever and when this is combined with the groundbreaking health applications (including the EKG feature), the Apple Watch has moved from a curiosity to a must-have.It\u2019s an incredible device and should be top of lots of your wish lists.Price: ~$430Best Buy (US) | Currys (UK)Well, Nintendo\u2018s truly got its mojo back. The Switch is a wonder. It\u2019s one of the most innovative devices out there, and something you couldn\u2019t have imagined any other company creating.And while some of the company\u2019s other experimental consoles (think the Wii U) were poorly made, the Switch feels like an engineering marvel. To this day, being able to play the same game in your living room and on public transport is breathtaking. It\u2019s the future.One of the criticisms originally levelled at the Switch was the lack of games, but now \u2013 a year and a half since its release \u2013 this has changed. Super Mario Odyssey,\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon: Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!, Breath of the Wild, Diablo III, and many more will keep everyone hooked.The Switch is a must-own gadget, whether you\u2019re an intense gamer or not. I couldn\u2019t imagine being without mine.Price: ~$300Amazon\u00a0| Best Buy (US) | HMV (UK)One of the joys of the Nintendo Switch is the multiplayer experience. Nothing beats crowding around a TV with some friends and gaming into the wee hours. And the best way to do that? With another set of Joy-Cons.Just like the Switch itself, the controllers are well-made, finely engineered, and innovative. Despite their looks, they feel like an advanced bit of technology, not a toy.Whether it\u2019s Mario Kart, Mario Party, or Overcooked 2, there are a raft of games that an extra pair of Joy-Cons will take to the next level. Plus, they\u2019re an ideal present if the person you\u2019re buying for already has a Switch.Price: ~$68Amazon | Best Buy (US) | Currys (UK)If you have a Switch, you\u2019re going to need a case. I mean, how else are you meant to carry it around? I tried out a few and the Orzly case had the best balance of storage space, protection, and price.You won\u2019t regret it.Price: ~$12AmazonIf you love gaming, but don\u2019t like the look of the Switch, the PS4 will be the console for you.The wide range of games, more mature content, and next-gen graphics make the PS4 a must-buy. It\u2019s powerful, has some terrific exclusive titles, and really has become the de facto console for the dedicated gamer.Price: ~$300Amazon | Best Buy (US) | Currys (UK)Dobble is like snap, if snap was sent back from the future to avenge its dead family. There are multiple variations of the game, but they all work in a similar way. There\u2019s a card with a selection of images, one of which will match an image on a card you\u2019re holding.It might sound simple, but I can\u2019t describe how much brain energy it takes.Dobble is a heap of fun, and can be picked up and played in seconds. Also, it can take up to eight players, which is great for family gatherings. I warn you though, things are going to get loud. Still, it\u2019s a perfect gift for people who like their games short.Price: ~$12Amazon (Spot It!) | Amazon (Dobble)If you\u2019ve been on the internet, you\u2019ll have come across the Oatmeal. The site, run by Matthew Inman, is filled with webcomics that have their fingers firmly on the pulse of internet culture. But Inman didn\u2019t stop at just comics\u2026Enter Exploding Kittens. It\u2019s a card-based game that requires very little time to play, less to learn, but is a whole load of fun. Think of it like an advanced version of Uno. It\u2019s part luck, part strategy, but pure entertainment.The whole thing is imbued with Inman\u2019s particular sense of humor, but most importantly, it\u2019s a great way to spend some time with your loved ones. And a brilliant gift.Price: ~$20ThinkGeek | AmazonThe other two physical games we\u2019ve recommended can be played and enjoyed by almost anyone. 7 Wonders: Duel isn\u2019t the same. Think of it like a two-player board game version of Civilization. If that sounds like something someone you know will like, they\u2019re going to be so happy when you buy this for them.It\u2019s a bit fiddly when you start playing, but it doesn\u2019t take too long to get in the groove and you realize what a finely balanced game it is. 7 Wonders: Duel is\u00a0the ideal gift for the board-game nerd in your life \u2013 their evenings and weekends are bound to get a lot more fun.Price: ~$30AmazonWe all remember Tamagotchis, right? RIGHT?These virtual pets were all the rage back in the day and, thankfully, they\u2019ve returned. They might not be as technologically impressive as they once were, but they\u2019re still just as much fun. And just as annoying.One thing I can guarantee is that whoever receives this gift will do so with a huge smile.Price: ~$20AmazonEver heard a story and idea so brilliant you were shocked it hadn\u2019t been done before? \u2018The Power\u2019 is like that.In this sci-fi influenced, speculative tale, women mysteriously develop powers that allows them to \u2018shock\u2019 people. Told over the course of a decade, the book tracks the moment the powers are first developed to the point of the whole world changing.It\u2019s a romping read that\u2019ll stay with you long after you\u2019ve finished it. A vital read.Price: ~$12AmazonYes, most data is stored in the cloud these days, but having a physical back-up is still important. Choosing a specific hard drive was tricky, but we eventually settled on this iStorage device.The inclusion of a keypad and military-grade encryption separates this hard drive from the rest. It means that your sensitive data will stay secure. On top of this, the embedded USB cable is also neat.If you\u2019re looking for a well-built, advanced hard drive, you can\u2019t do wrong with the iStorage.Price: ~$270NewEgg (US) |\u00a0Currys (UK)Portable chargers aren\u2019t sexy, but I love them. The idea of going out in the world without a way to give my phone, iPod, headphones, Switch, and other gadgets some juice is unthinkable. I won\u2019t do it.But which one to choose? Anker. Choose Anker. The PowerCore 26800 in specific is brilliant. It has a huge capacity and three USB slots, so you can charge a trio of devices at once. Or you can let your friends have some juice, if you\u2019re that way inclined.This is an essential tool for the gadget lover, make sure that person in your life has one.Price: ~$66Amazon | Anker\u00a0|\u00a0eBay\u00a0Look at that beautiful case. You know why it\u2019s so beat up? Because I\u2019ve had it for over four years. Yep, that\u2019s an iPhone 6 Plus underneath that genuine leather case. Somehow, over four years of daily use, abuse, and general battering, the Torro iPhone case has remained steadfast.And you know what else? The case has a selection of hand slots for all my cards. Does that make me an old man? Probably. But why should I care when the case is so good?To put it bluntly, when I finally cave and buy a new iPhone, the first thing I\u2019ll purchase after will be a Torro case.Price: ~$35AmazonWe like some products.
