For reference, the next most successful Nintendo console was the Nintendo 64 at 33 million units and the most successful (in non-handhelds) is the Wii at 101 million units.It\u2019s all about cryptocurrency and blockchainThis is significant not so much just because sales keep climbing \u2014 I could have told you that would eventually happen \u2014 but because of the differences between the Switch and the GameCube that highlight how Nintendo has changed and adapted to the changing market.We\u2019ve pointed it out before, but the Switch hasn\u2019t exactly put a lot of work into exclusive games. Yeah, it\u2019s got a few killer titles \u2014\u00a0Super Mario Odyssey,\u00a0Breath of the Wild,\u00a0Mario Kart.\u00a0But for the most part, when you hear news about Switch games, it\u2019s a port of another game, such as\u00a0Dark Souls, LIMBO, or most recently\u00a0ARK: Survival Evolved. And every time, the unspoken implication is that Nintendo is to be commended for allowing outside games into its library, as that hasn\u2019t always been the case.With the GameCube, for example, the games I remember the most from that console are the likes of\u00a0Twilight Princess, or\u00a0Mario Sunshine, or\u00a0Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance. Of course there were popular non-Nintendo titles made for the GameCube \u2014 hello,\u00a0Resident Evil\u00a0franchise \u2014 but the most popular games for the console were almost invariably first-party.So it\u2019s a bit of a surprise to see Nintendo put such an emphasis porting third-party games \u2014 and even more so because that appears to be working for them. The Switch\u2019s sales figures don\u2019t appear to be plateauing at the moment, though admittedly the console will have to do some pretty frantic holiday sales if it wants to meet its projected yearly goal.In the meantime, Nintendo is holding a Direct later this week to show off new details about the upcoming Super Smash Bros Ultimate. If any first-party Nintendo title in the world were to boost the Switch into Wii-like numbers, I think it\u2019d be that one.\n\nNintendo Switch sales top 22.86 million, overtaking the GameCube\non VG247\n\n\nRead next:\n\n        Social media mobs are worse for society than the people they shame    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
