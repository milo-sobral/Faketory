In other news, the sky is still blue and bears still shit in the woods.As the\u00a0Fallout 76\u00a0beta is due to open tomorrow, one can only assume the note was a bizarre attempt to soften the blow for the people who are going to find the bugs the hard way. It begins with a description of how the game came to being, and how the studio feared trying something that was a bit out of their comfort zone. It\u2019s all very self-effacing (and dare I suggest a bit disingenuous):Once the idea of \u2018Fallout-Online-Survival-Game\u2019 stuck, there was not running back, but still some worry and questions. Will people want this from Fallout? Will they want it from us? How the hell are we going to make this? And what, exactly is\u00a0this?\u201dIt\u2019s our cool new gadget site.With that in mind, the company very tactfully suggested players would find some glitches when they fired up the game, and it would require player input to know what to fix first:Given what we\u2019re doing with 76, we know we\u2019re opening everyone up to all new spectacular issues none of us have encountered. Some we\u2019re aware of, such as areas where performance needs to improve with lots of players. Others, we surely don\u2019t. We need your help finding them, and advice on what\u2019s important to fix.Really inspires excitement to play, doesn\u2019t it?Remember when\u00a0Skyrim\u00a0first came out and darned near everybody reported a humorous bug or twenty? My favorite was the dragons flying backwards. To this day, I still get the occasional NPC glitching through the ground or an item floating in the air. And it\u2019s not like\u00a0Skyrim\u00a0was a unique Bethesda RPG in that regard. Several of the\u00a0Fallout\u00a0and\u00a0Elder Scrolls\u00a0games\u00a0have had massive bugs on launch \u2014 it\u2019s just something we\u2019ve come to accept about them.The problem is so endemic that Todd Howard even joked about it during this year\u2019s E3 event, saying \u201cI\u2019ve read on the internet that our games have a few bugs. I did, I read it on the internet, so it\u2019s true.\u201d Cheeky smugness aside, he\u2019s not wrong.So for Bethesda to plead for mercy with its prospective new players by admitting upfront there are going to be massive bugs even they don\u2019t know about is an odd way to welcome them into the beta phase. We\u2019re kind of expecting it, guys. But if you, my gentle readers, are part of the beta and you spot some problems, remember to complain about them often and loudly \u2014 Bethesda is literally asking you to.\nRead next:\n\n        Trump begs big tech for free labor to avoid federal hirings    \nStay tuned with our weekly recap of what\u2019s hot & cool by our CEO Boris.\n        Join over 260,000 subscribers!\n    \n                Sit back and let the hottest tech news come to you by the magic of electronic mail.\n            \n                Prefer to get the news as it happens?
