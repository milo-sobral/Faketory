How about the other ones, folks? Oh you\u2019ll see others now.\"He blasted Democrats for their \"disrespectful\" treatment of Kavanaugh, and urged his supporters to recall the bitter confirmation fight ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.\"He could\u2019ve lost a judgeship on a story that was made up,\" he said. \"And the way the Democrats treated him and us, you\u2019ve got to get to the polls on Tuesday and you\u2019ve got to vote.\"Munro-Leighton was one of four women to make sexual misconduct allegations\u00a0against Kavanaugh. Grassley also referred accuser Julie Swetnick and her attorney, Michael Avenatti for\u00a0investigation.No such referral has been made for\u00a0Christine\u00a0Blasey Ford or Deborah Ramirez.Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September that Kavanaugh pinned her down and groped her during a party when the two were in high school.\u00a0Ramirez alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party when the two were in college.The FBI conducted a supplementary background check into Ford's and Ramirez's allegations. Republican lawmakers said that the report did not turn up evidence of their claims.Kavanaugh denied all of the claims against him, and was confirmed, 50-48, by the Senate following a bitter confirmation process.Republicans have argued that their base will be drawn to the ballot box out of frustration with how Kavanaugh was treated during his confirmation process.Democrats, meanwhile, have maintained that their supporters will turn out\u00a0in part\u00a0out of anger that the judge was confirmed despite\u00a0the sexual misconduct allegations.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
