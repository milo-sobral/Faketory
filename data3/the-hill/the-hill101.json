But on trade, he\u2019s long espoused positions similar to Trump\u2019s, which have been popular with his political base.He\u2019s got the image of a somewhat rumpled local politician who fits in well with the industrial Midwest, perhaps the key geographic area in the next presidential race.If a Democratic candidate can take back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three states central to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, they\u2019d win back the White House assuming they carry the other states won by Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTexas history curriculum to emphasize that slavery played 'central role' in Civil War Election Countdown: Abrams ends fight in Georgia governor's race | Latest on Florida recount | Booker, Harris head to campaign in Mississippi Senate runoff | Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority Texas education board approves restoring Hillary Clinton in history curriculum MORE.\u00a0\u201cThose states will be critical,\u201d said Sen.

It\u2019s also the person.\u201d\u00a0When it comes to taking on Trump, a candidate like Brown could be the solution, Democrats say.\u00a0\u201cIn many respects he provides the perfect antidote to President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jim Manley, who got to know Brown when he served in the Senate for then-Majority Leader Harry ReidHarry Mason ReidNevada New Members 2019 Meet the lawyer Democrats call when it's recount time Cortez Masto poised to become DSCC chair MORE.\u201cHe\u2019s a proud progressive but he doesn\u2019t utilize the harsh rhetoric that some on the left use,\u201d Manley said.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the difference.\u201dIn an interview with The New York Times this week, Brown acknowledged that he is \u201cthinking\u201d about running for president. He told the newspaper that he and his wife, the journalist Connie Schultz, \u201chave been overwhelmed by the number of people that have come forward and said \u2018You\u2019ve got to run. You have the right message. You come from the right state.\u2019 \u201d\u00a0Those who know Brown well say he was never interested in a White House bid.One source, however, said the senator was \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d he wasn\u2019t selected by Hillary Clinton as her running mate in 2016.\u201cHe thought he could have added something to the ticket,\u201d the source said. \u201cI think he was right.\u201d\u00a0Brown could have a future as a vice presidential candidate again, though there would surely be fears in Democratic circles that it would risk losing a seat to Republicans in the closely divided Senate. \u00a0The incoming governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, is a Republican.More recently, particularly after the controversies surrounding the Trump presidency, Brown began to give a White House run more thought, associates say.\u00a0\u201cHis focus was always on winning re-election but he was definitely giving it a lot of thought at the same time and why not?\u201d said one Democrat who discussed the topic with the senator.\u00a0\u201cI think he saw how Trump won and that\u2019s his constituency. He gets them and they get him.\u201dAt a time when Democrats are struggling to rally around a unifying message for the party, Democrats keep pointing to Brown\u2019s economic vision, one they say worked well in his reelection bid.\u00a0Ben LaBolt, the Democratic strategist and longtime Obama spokesman who worked for Brown, said that message can easily be applied to a 2020 campaign. \u00a0\u201c\u2026He has a vision for how to make sure good paying jobs that allow you to support your family will be created not just on the coasts but throughout the country,\u201d LaBolt said.To that point, Sen.

He has a plain way of speak, he\u2019s consistent and people respect him for that.\u201d\u00a0Brown would also likely face a number of colleagues if he chooses to run for the White House.Among the senators thought to be considering bids are fellow Democratic Sens.
