The Hill's Jordain Carney tells us about the biggest obstacles to\u00a0funding the government here.What comes next: Both chambers are set to be in session for approximately four weeks once they reconvene on Tuesday. That gives lawmakers little room for error as they race to wrap up their work for this session of Congress.\u00a0LEADING THE DAYTrump blames stock market slide on 'Presidential Harassment by the Dems'\u00a0 President Trump on Monday blamed a sharp stock market downturn on the specter of Democratic investigations when they take control in the new Congress.\"The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!\" Trump said Monday in a tweet published two hours after U.S. stocks opened with heavy losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost more than 400 points by the time of Trump's tweet, a 1.6-percent drop, while the Nasdaq composite sunk almost 3 percent. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent.All three indexes closed with major losses due in part by\u00a0deep declines in Apple and Goldman Sachs stocks\u00a0that triggered sell-offs across several sectors. The Dow finished Monday down more than 600 points, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.78 percent and the S&P closed down almost 2 percent.The background:\u00a0U.S. stocks have\u00a0dropped steadily\u00a0since the start of October as traders fear an imminent economic slowdown, fading global growth and rising trade tensions. Analysts have said that the strong U.S. economy appears to be past its peak, while corporations report narrower profit margins.Even so, Trump has repeatedly blamed the downturn on the prospect of a Democratic majority in the House blocking his legislative agenda and probing his personal finances. Democrats in line to chair key House committees have pledged to obtain Trump's\u00a0tax returns\u00a0and\u00a0banking records,\u00a0seeking evidence of illegal activity.\u00a0Bloomberg: Trump moves closer to auto tariffs: \"The White House is circulating a draft report by the U.S. Commerce Department over\u00a0whether to impose tariffs on automobile imports\u00a0to protect national security, three people familiar with the matter said,\" according to a report from Bloomberg.\"President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with senior members of his trade team on Tuesday to discuss how to proceed on the potential tariffs, two of the people said. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, they didn't give any insight into Commerce's conclusions.\"\u00a0Trump hits Comcast over alleged antitrust violations:President Trump on Monday lashed out at Comcast after a group representing small cable providers asked the Department of Justice to investigate the company over antitrust concerns, The Hill's Brett Samuels and Harper Neidig report.\"American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws,\" Trump said in a tweet, adding that the group believes Comcast's merger with NBC poses greater anticompetitive concerns than the recent AT&T-Time Warner merger.The ACA wrote to the Justice Department last week arguing that vertical mergers where pay-TV providers like Comcast and AT&T combine with companies that offer programming give the merged firms the \"incentive and ability to disadvantage rival distributors by raising the prices it charges these rivals for programming.\"The president's attack comes after a Fox Business article suggested the Justice Department could be following through with an investigation.\u00a0Harper and Brett explain the controversy here.\u00a0GOOD TO KNOW\u00a0ODDS AND ENDSView the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
