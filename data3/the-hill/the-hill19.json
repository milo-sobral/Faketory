The Saudi government\u00a0had claimed that they didn't know where he was, before acknowledging Friday that he had died inside the consulate.Trump on Friday\u00a0lauded\u00a0Saudi Arabia's initial arrests of more than a dozen Saudi nationals as a \"good first step\" by the Kingdom in responding to the investigation.\"It's a big step. There's a lot of people involved,\" Trump told reporters, adding when pressed that he found the Saudi explanation for Khashoggi's death to be credible.Other Republicans, including Sen.

Now, a fight breaks out and he\u2019s killed in the consulate, all without knowledge of Crown Prince,\u201d he added, referring to the Saudi government's evolving explanations for the incident.The disappearance and death of Khashoggi has sparked international uproar and ensnared the Trump administration, which has put a close relationship with Riyadh at the center of its foreign policy strategy.Finance ministers from the U.S. and several other countries\u00a0have withdrawn from a planned conference in Riyadh later this month over the journalist's fate, though\u00a0it is unclear what response the U.S. may have for his death.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
