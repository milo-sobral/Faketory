CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.\u00a0THE TOPLINE:\u00a0Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave his\u00a0first public remarks Wednesday\u00a0on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- attempting to distance himself from an act many are skeptical he did know about.Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative business conference, Prince Mohammed called Khashoggi's killing a \"heinous crime\" and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.\"The crime was really painful to all Saudis, and I believe it is painful to every human in the world,\" Prince Mohammed said at an investment conference. \"It is a heinous crime that cannot be justified. Today, Saudi Arabia is carrying out all legal things to finalize the investigation to work with the, cooperate with the Turkish government and to present the perpetrators to the court and take their judgment.\"Timing:\u00a0Recall that a day before, President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE dialed up his rhetoric against the kingdom and his administration announced its first punitive steps against the Saudis.On Tuesday, Trump called the Saudi response the Khashoggi's killing the \"worst cover-up ever.\" He also for the first time suggested Prince Mohammed could be involved in the mission to kill Khashoggi.\"He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,\" Trump told the Wall Street Journal.Secretary of State Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 Lawmakers struggle with how to punish Saudi Arabia | Trump regrets not visiting Arlington for Veterans Day | North Korea deports detained American Corker: 'A price needs to be paid' for Khashoggi's murder White House eyeing ways to remove Erdo\u011fan foe G\u00fclen from US: report MORE also announced Tuesday that visas will be revoked for those the United States has identified as suspects in the killing and said sanctions are also being considered.Saudi-Turkish relationship:\u00a0People in Washington have been questioning how the crisis will affect the U.S.-Saudi relationship.Prince Mohammed didn't address that. But he did vow the issue won't break the Saudi-Turkish relationship.\"We know that many are trying to use this painful thing to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Turkey,\" he said. \"I want to send them a message. They will not be able to do that as long as there is a king called King Salman bin Abdulaziz and a crown prince called Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and a president in Turkey called Erdogan.\"Prince Mohammed and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly spoke by phone Wednesday, a day after Erdogan called the killing a \"savage\" premeditated murder directed by top Saudi officials.A laughing matter?:\u00a0Prince Mohammed made his comments Wednesday on a panel alongside the prime minister of Lebanon and the crown prince of Bahrain.As the panel wrapped up, Prince Mohammed\u00a0decided to make a joke\u00a0about allegations he kidnapped Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri last year.\"I just want to conclude with one thing: Prime Minister Saad is going to be here for two days, so please, no ideas that he is kidnapped,\" Prince Mohammed said at the end of the panel.After the line, Hariri and Prince Mohammed laughed and shook hands.In November 2017, Hariri was reportedly forcibly detained in Saudi Arabia as part of Prince Mohammed's efforts to pressure Lebanon on its relationship with Iran and Hezbollah.While in Saudi Arabia, Hariri tendered his resignation as prime minister via a televised message. Weeks later, he returned to Lebanon and withdrew his resignation.Critics say the bizarre episode with Hariri was early evidence of Prince Mohammed's strong-arm tactics that are even more apparent after Khashoggi's killing.\u00a0DEMS DEMAND ARMS TREATY BRIEFING:\u00a0The top Democrats on the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committee penned Wednesday a furious, four-page letter to Defense Secretary James MattisJames Norman MattisOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 Lawmakers struggle with how to punish Saudi Arabia | Trump regrets not visiting Arlington for Veterans Day | North Korea deports detained American Ousted Bolton aide says it was 'an honor' to serve Trump administration Macron\u2019s 'Euro-army' is an idea whose time has come MORE and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0demanding they personally brief lawmakers\u00a0on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.\"We write to express our grave concern that the Trump administration is notifying Russia that the United States intends to unilaterally withdraw from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, without any notice to or consultation with Congress, even as our committees had requested a briefing on these issues,\" wrote Reps.

Gregory MeeksGregory Weldon MeeksOvernight Defense: Saudi crown prince calls Khashoggi killing 'heinous crime' in first public remarks | Dems demand briefing on Trump leaving arms control treaty | Lawmakers want probe into Pentagon cloud computing contract Dems demand Mattis, Pompeo brief on Trump's withdrawal from arms control treaty Trump Jr., Dem congressman spar over Ellison's association with Farrakhan MORE (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.Concerns:\u00a0The lawmakers ticked off a slew of concerns with Trump's decision to withdraw from the treaty that bans ground-launched nuclear and conventional missiles with intermediate ranges.For one, they said, it \"discards the results of the administration's own extensive review\" on how to respond to Russia's treaty violations.They also said it plays into Putin's hands, drives a wedge between NATO allies and is unsupported by any Pentagon determination on the need to test or deploy INF-banned missiles.Questions:\u00a0Lawmakers won't get back in town for any potential briefing until the week of Nov. 13.In the meantime, the Democratic trio had a list of questions they want Pompeo and Mattis to answer in writing by Nov. 2.They asked for an assessment of the military threat to the United States and its European allies of deploying intermediate-range missiles without restriction, the status of the administration's December 2017 announcement on using an integrated approach to push Russia back into compliance and the status of consultations with allies.The lawmakers also raised concerns about the status of a separate treaty with Russia known as New START, which caps the number of nuclear warheads each country is allowed to deploy. The treaty is up for renewal in 2021.\u00a0JEDI QUESTIONS:\u00a0Two Republican lawmakers are asking the Pentagon's inspector general\u00a0to investigate the bidding process\u00a0for a multibillion-dollar Defense Department cloud computing contract, which critics claim is biased toward Amazon.Reps.

The lawmakers called the requirement \"unnecessary\" and noted it can \"only be met by one contractor.\"They didn't specify the contractor, but the only company bidding that meets the requirements is Amazon Web Services.The duo also expressed concerns about whether the contract bidding requirements violated Pentagon ethics rules.Background:\u00a0The letter is the latest flashpoint over the lucrative $10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract. Since the start of the bidding process, critics, including many bidding competitors to Amazon, have alleged that the process is biased towards the Seattle-based company.They say that Amazon lobbyists' connections to the Defense Department helped craft a contract tailor-made for the company and that other competitors, including Microsoft and IBM, have no realistic shot of winning.Amazon did not immediately respond for a request to comment on the letter, but in the past the company has dismissed accusations that it has any sort of inside track in the contracting process.\u00a0ON TAP FOR TOMORROWThe Brookings Institution will host an expert panel to discuss \"U.S. policy and the war in Yemen\" at 10 a.m.\u00a0https://brook.gs/2SejKAlThe Atlantic Council will host a panel including Norwegian Ministry of Defense policy director Svein Efjestad to discuss \"Security in Northern Europe: Deterrence, Defense and Dialogue\" at 3:30 p.m.\u00a0https://bit.ly/2EjTEsUDefense Secretary James Mattis will participate in a White House commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the suicide bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut at 6 p.m.\u00a0https://bit.ly/2PSK8yd\u00a0ICYMI-- The Hill: Pentagon\u00a0expands bug bounty program\u00a0with contracts to three private security firms-- The Hill: Majority says\u00a0Trump is too soft\u00a0on Saudi Arabia: poll-- The Hill: Iran: Saudi Arabia\u00a0'wouldn't dare'\u00a0kill Khashoggi without US protection-- The Hill: Kremlin: Trump's\u00a0intention to develop\u00a0new missile 'extremely dangerous'-- The Hill: NATO: More nukes in\u00a0Europe not likely\u00a0in response to Russian treaty breach-- The Hill: Opinion:\u00a0Russia's threats go beyond\u00a0elections-- The Hill: Opinion:\u00a0America's allies: The fourth\u00a0strategic offset-- The Washington Post: U.S. military\u00a0scales back contacts\u00a0with Afghans after 'insider' shootings-- Associated Press: Retired\u00a0US general says\u00a0war with China likely in 15 yearsView the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
