{"id": "The Memo: Dem hopes for 2020 grow in midterms afterglow", "paragraph": "Democrats are gaining confidence about winning back the White House in 2020 in the days following last week\u2019s midterm elections. And they increasingly think a candidate from the party\u2019s left flank could be the person to do it.On election night, the midterms were widely perceived to end in a split decision, with Republicans making gains in the Senate that offset Democratic victories in the House.But that narrative, which seemed to crystallize within hours of East Coast polls closing, failed to acknowledge more positive signs for Democrats that emerged later.First, in the later hours of election night, Rep.

Kyrsten Sinema (D) has come from behind in early tallies and is now the favorite to win a Senate seat in Arizona \u2014 another pick-up for Democrats.Two marquee races in Florida, for governor and for Senate, are going to a recount, having initially looked like Republican wins.And Democratic gains in the House have ticked up toward the high end of expectations. Democrats have gained a net 32 seats already and they have a good chance of adding at least another four from the 10 contests that remain undecided.All of those events have put a more vibrant spring in Democrats\u2019 step.\u201cI see a much more viable pathway [in 2020] after analyzing not just the returns on election night but analyzing the last week,\u201d Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky told The Hill.Roginsky added that she had been \u201cquite depressed\u201d on election night because, though the bottom-line results for Democrats were solid, the party had not appeared to receive the popular mandate for which its partisans had been hoping.Since then, she asserted, it has become evident that energizing the liberal base and nonhabitual voters, and providing an \u201cantidote\u201d to President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE, could pave the road to success in 2020.\u201cPlaying it safe, as Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTexas history curriculum to emphasize that slavery played 'central role' in Civil War Election Countdown: Abrams ends fight in Georgia governor's race | Latest on Florida recount | Booker, Harris head to campaign in Mississippi Senate runoff | Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority Texas education board approves restoring Hillary Clinton in history curriculum MORE did in 2016, is not the antidote,\u201d Roginsky said. \u201cThe antidote is to do what Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaAs Democrats gear up to challenge Trump in 2020, the key political divide will be metropolitan versus rural Trump's take on midterms: \u2018Epic' win in Senate, \u2018better than other sitting Presidents\u2019 in House NASA's carpool to Space Station is back on as Russian rocket Soyuz quickly returns to flight MORE did in 2008, which is to energize different communities where people don\u2019t feel they are being listened to.\u201dThere was deep progressive disappointment on election night, when it appeared that three of the left\u2019s favorite candidates had all come up short: Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke in the Senate race in Texas, as well as gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia.As time has passed, there is growing recognition that the trio nevertheless outperformed expectations, especially in the cases of O\u2019Rourke and Abrams.Gillum has retracted his initial concession in the governor\u2019s race, while Abrams never conceded \u2014 though both candidates face steep uphill climbs to win.More broadly, liberals contrast the strong showings from the progressive trio with the defeats of more centrist Democrats by wider margins.

But that strategy requires threading a very fine needle.\u201dStill, some Democrats express notes of caution, especially when it comes to the apparent resilience of the Trump base.Democratic gains in the House, they note, were positive but hardly outside the historic norms. Democrats lost 63 House seats in Obama\u2019s first midterm election, in 2010, and 54 seats during the first midterm contest of the Clinton presidency, in 1994.\u201cDonald Trump is very much in charge,\u201d said New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. \"Despite having lost the House, he held onto big states in the Senate.\u201dLooking ahead to 2020, Sheinkopf added, Democrats needed a presidential nominee \u201cwho appeals to more than the coasts. They need someone who can break off even a part of the Trump constituency.\u201d\u00a0Jerry Austin, a Democratic strategist in Ohio, lamented that his state\u00a0is now \u201cmuch more of a guaranteed red state than we are a purple state.\u201dStill, Austin noted, incumbent Sen.
