I follow all rules, procedures, regulations and most importantly the law. This is another politically driven investigation that has no merit.\"Steve Ryan, Zinke's counsel, called the reports \"unsubstantiated.\"\"The Secretary has not been contacted or notified of any DOJ investigation or Inspector General referral. It is disappointing that unsubstantiated and anonymous sources have described an IG office referral to members of the media, as this violates DOJ and IG policy direction,\" he said in a statement to The Hill.He added: \"The Secretary has done nothing wrong.\"A spokesperson for Interior's OIG said they can't comment on ongoing investigations. A DOJ spokesman said it is the agency's policy not to confirm, deny or comment on potential probes.The agency currently has three open investigations into the secretary, including a real estate business deal Zinke entered into with the chairman of oil field services company Halliburton and another on a decision he made against approving a casino project in Connecticut after heavy lobbying from casino giant MGM.Why it matters: The Interior Department was in the spotlight earlier in the month after The Hill first reported that the Interior Department would be replacing its long-time deputy Inspector General with a Trump political appointee, Suzanne Tufts, who was previously confirmed to a job at Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Interior later denied that the replacement was ever finalized. A HUD spokesman later apologized for the misinformation and said the employee had resigned. The timing is leaving many wondering how and when Interior knew about the investigationRead more here.\u00a0Happy Tuesday!
