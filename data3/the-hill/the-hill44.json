And so people are getting into a political game of saying, 'Who's responsible?' He's not responsible, but his rhetoric definitely is an issue in America at this time,\" the\u00a0Fox host\u00a0said.Watters argued that members of the media at the time were \"very prudent and responsible\" in not assigning responsibility to Obama during his tenure when officers were\u00a0killed\u00a0in New York and Dallas during his second term.\"I just want to say one thing to [co-host] Juan [Williams]. When there was shootings of police officers, and officers in this country were executed in New York City and in Texas during the Obama administration, no one blamed Barack Obama for his anti-police rhetoric, or supporting Black Lives Matter,\u201d Watters said.\u201cNo one linked him to that. No one said his rhetoric contributed to an atmosphere where cops were killed,\" he added. \"We were all very prudent and responsible.\u201d\"Yet, any time there's any act of violence in this country, Donald Trump's name is inserted by his political opponents, and it's wrong.\"Some conservatives made the argument that Obama was \"anti-police\" during his presidency, a claim the White House strongly pushed back on at the time.In July 2016, Obama met with prominent leaders of Black Lives Matter at the White House along with law enforcement officials, civil rights leaders and local politicians following the killing of five police officers by sniper Micah Xavier Johnson in Dallas on July 7, 2016.\u00a0Williams on Tuesday responded to Watters by saying that his argument was \"not analogous.\"\"Jesse, you're a good guy. That's not analogous. That's not right,\" Williams replied. \"It's not the same as\u00a0him saying 'I think there's a problem with police abuse in this country.' \"\u00a0President Trump and first lady Melania TrumpMelania TrumpMichelle Obama's stylist downplays controversy over Melania Trump jacket Trump offered Ricardel ambassadorship to Estonia after Melania forced her out of White House: report Michelle Obama: I never had a presidential staffer fired MORE visited Pittsburgh\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0afternoon to pay respects to the\u00a0victims of the shooting and visit with officers in the hospital who were wounded during the massacre\u00a0on Saturday.\u00a0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
