Consumers' forecasts for the current economy improved from 169.4 to 172.8, while expectations for the near future improved from 112.5 to 114.6 this month.\"Consumers' assessment of present-day conditions remains quite positive, primarily due to strong employment growth,\" said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.\"Consumers do not foresee the economy losing steam anytime soon. Rather, they expect the strong pace of growth to carry over into early 2019.\"Why it matters:\u00a0Consumer spending plays a critical role in U.S. GDP growth and often serves as a bellwether for the broader economy.Statistics released by the government on Friday showed the economy growing at\u00a0a healthy 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter, down from an exceptional 4.2 percent in the second quarter.Third-quarter GDP growth was powered primarily by consumer spending and retail inventories, which typically reflect short-term confidence in the economy. But business investment and capital expansion fell over the past three months--two warning signs that the Trump\u00a0boom could be past its prime.\u00a0Chamber warns against taxes targeting tech companies: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday is\u00a0raising concerns about digital services taxes,\u00a0after the United Kingdom on Monday announced plans to move forward with such a tax on large technology companies.\"The American business community supports international dialogue on ways to modernize the international taxation system to adapt to changes in the global economy,\" Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinSteven Terner MnuchinOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 Border deployment 'peaked' at 5,800 troops | Trump sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | Senators offer bill to press Trump on Saudis | Paul effort to block Bahrain arms sale fails On The Money: Senior GOP senator warns Trump against shutdown | Treasury sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | HQ2 deal brings new scrutiny on Amazon | Senate confirms Bowman to Fed board The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Sponsored by Delta Air Lines \u2014 Trump sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | Insurgents seek female challenger to Pelosi for Speakership | Broward County finishes machine recount MORE.\"However, unilateral European actions will erode trust and lessen the prospects for international agreement; indeed, we now see governments outside of Europe considering similar actions.\"Donohue outlined three main concerns the Chamber has with digital services taxes.
