Attacker has been detained. More riot police arriving at Independence Mall now. pic.twitter.com/BUk6LrUZTaScene getting ugly here, cops wading in pic.twitter.com/oJiwcjb9KzThe Facebook event page for the \u201cWe The People Rally\u201d described the event as for the \u201csilent majority\u201d and said the event is for \u201call Patriots, Militia, 3%, constitution loving Americans, pro good cop, pro [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], pro law and order, pro life, pro American value, pro gun and anti illegal immigration ... Will you stand with us? ITS TIME TO SHOW PHILLY WHAT PATRIOTISM REALLY IS!!\u201dWhile the event page said \u201cAny violence, racism, or display of hate by any group or individual is extremely prohibited,\u201d clashes were reported as groups like the far-right Proud Boys came head to head with counterprotesters, some of whom belonged to antifascist group Antifa.The Proud Boys is made up of self-described \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d and are labeled as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.A Facebook event page for a counterprotest said, \u201cThe residents and allies of Philadelphia must stand in opposition to this escalation of the far-right\u2019s push into the city\u2019s culture and politics.\u201dReports said about 25 people came out for the scheduled rally, but that number was dwarfed by the number of counterprotesters. The event fizzled\u00a0by around 2:15 p.m., with counterprotesters chanting \"Don't come back!\" as attendees left.However, it appears the clashes were held to a minimum and no significant injuries were reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that at least one person had been arrested.The Philadelphia Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
