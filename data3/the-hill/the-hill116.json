Jerry Brown (D) and his successor, Lt.\u00a0Gov.

I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. It should have been a lot different situation, but the one thing is that everybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing, and there\u2019s no question about it,\" Trump told reporters Saturday before leaving the White House.\"It should have been done many years ago. But I think everybody\u2019s on the right side. It\u2019s a big issue, it\u2019s a big issue, a very expensive issue, but very, very inexpensive when you compare it to even one of these horrible fires.

Rice.\u00a0The president has since moderated\u00a0his tone, saying earlier this week he\u2019d spoken with Brown to offer his support, which he reiterated in a tweet Friday night.Just spoke to Governor Jerry Brown to let him know that we are with him, and the people of California, all the way!Thank you @JerryBrownGov.
