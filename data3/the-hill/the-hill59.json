{"id": "Chinese intel officers charged with hacking US companies to steal sensitive aviation data", "paragraph": "The Justice Department on Tuesday unsealed charges against a group of Chinese intelligence officers, alleging that they hacked into a series of\u00a0private companies\u2019 computer systems in the U.S. and abroad as part of an effort to steal\u00a0sensitive commercial aviation data.Zha Rong, Chai Meng and seven other co-conspirators worked to steal intellectual property and other sensitive\u00a0data from over a dozen\u00a0companies so that\u00a0China could develop a turbofan engine\u00a0\"without incurring substantial research and development expenses,\" according to the to the indictment.\"Members of the conspiracy targeted, among other things, data and information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial jetliners.\u00a0At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere,\"\u00a0it adds.The indictment says these nine individuals worked for a provincial foreign intelligence arm of the People\u2019s Republic of China's security apparatus known as the\u00a0Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security (JSSD),\u00a0both which\u00a0deal with domestic counter-intelligence. The JSSD-linked\u00a0group allegedly\u00a0worked to steal the\u00a0data over the course of five years starting in 2010.One of the charged hackers,\u00a0Zhang Zhang-Gui, is also being charged in a separate hacking conspiracy\u00a0along with Chinese national Li Xiao for allegedly leveraging the hacked computers \"for their own criminal ends,\" according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) press release.While the\u00a0firms are not directly named in the indictment, a majority\u00a0of the companies targeted\u00a0pertained to\u00a0the aerospace industry, while others were involved in technology, critical infrastructure and a gas turbine manufacturer.\u00a0An Australian domain registrar company and a French-owned aerospace company were also targeted.The new round of charges come as the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0is stepping up\u00a0its public criticism of what it\u00a0considers unacceptable behavior by\u00a0China, which includes\u00a0military, economic and cyber fronts.This comes after\u00a0the DOJ announced charges against a\u00a0Chinese intelligence officer named\u00a0Yanjun Xu last month. Xu has\u00a0been extradited to the\u00a0U.S. to face economic espionage charges for working with a co-conspirator to target GE Aviation and other companies in and outside\u00a0the U.S. since at least December 2013 in order to also steal sensitive data.\u00a0U.S. officials say this is only the start of their efforts to crack down on Beijing's intellectual property theft.\u201cFor the third time since only September, the National Security Division, with its US Attorney partners, has brought charges against Chinese intelligence officers from the JSSD and those working at their direction and control for stealing American intellectual property,\u201d John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement. \u201cThis is just the beginning. Together with our federal partners, we will redouble our efforts to safeguard America\u2019s ingenuity and investment.\u201dThe charges unveiled\u00a0on Tuesday are also likely to further strain the relationship\u00a0between the U.S. and China, which is already\u00a0embroiled in an\u00a0ongoing trade battle.\u00a0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
