We stand with each other and mourn for our dead, and show up to protect each other.\"\u00a0Trump's Tuesday visit to Pittsburgh has been met with some pushback, including from city public officials who say they are focused on the first funerals for victims of the shooting.Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto (D) declined to appear with Trump during his visit, saying \u201call attention [Tuesday] should be on the victims.\u201dThe protesters, donned in black clothes, marched as they held signs reading \"anti-Semitism upholds white supremacy,\" \"your words have consequences\" and more. At one point, they paused to sing the Mourner's Kaddish, a Jewish prayer commemorating the dead.At a protest/Shiva organized by @IfNotNow in #Pittsburgh, they\u2019re reciting the mourner\u2019s Kaddish, and singing Ozi V\u2019Zimrat Yah. pic.twitter.com/SAnbDgPMryAs of Tuesday evening, more than 77,000 people\u00a0had signed an open letter\u00a0from progressive Jewish leaders saying Trump was not\u00a0welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism.Eleven members of the Pittsburgh affiliate of Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice\u00a0penned the letter to Trump\u00a0following Saturday's shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue.The suspect in the shooting, Robert Bowers, made his first court appearance Monday. He faces 29 federal counts, including hate crime charges, after reportedly making anti-Semitic comments before he allegedly opened\u00a0fire.The president and the White House have condemned the attack as anti-Semitic, but critics have said the condolences are not enough. Democrats and progressive activists have blamed the president's aggressive rhetoric, pointing to the moment when he said there were \"fine people\" among the neo-Nazis who organized a deadly protest in Charlottesville, Va. last year.Before the massacre, the alleged shooter posted on social media about the so-called caravan of Central American migrants slowly making their way to the U.S. border. Trump has continually referred to the caravan as an \"invasion.\"Republicans and others have said the only person at fault is\u00a0the gunman.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
