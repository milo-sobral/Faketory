Due to her stature and aggressive behavior, officers took her to the ground attempting to get her to release her fists,\" police said in a statement obtained by the station.But Jessica Dennis, the mother of the teenage girl, told the station she felt the officer\u2019s actions were \"completely overboard.\"\"Her hands are pinned up, he's fish tailing her whole body with her shorts. It was just too much going on and she clearly wasn't aggressive,\" she said at a recent news conference, according to the station.An attorney representing Dennis\u2019s family said in a statement to the local station that \u201cto say that the police officer was justified to punch her continuously while he has his knee on her back and her hands under her belly, the video speaks for itself.\"\u00a0Though the police department is not currently investigating the officer\u2019s actions,\u00a0that could change if Dennis\u00a0moves to\u00a0submit a formal complaint.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
