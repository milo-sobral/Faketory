The White House said Trump took a bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace instead of walking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es with the other leaders \"due to security protocols.\"Then, during the ceremony, Macron took what appeared to be a thinly veiled shot at Trump, saying that \"patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.\"\"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said. \"By saying our interests first ... we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what gives it grace, and what is essential: its moral values.\"What Trump did visit: Trump skipped the Saturday cemetery visit, but he did make his scheduled visit Sunday to the Suresnes American Cemetery outside of Paris.There, he paid tribute to American and French service members who died in World War I.\"The American and French patriots of World War I embody the timeless virtues of our two republics. Honor and courage. Strength and valor. Love and loyalty, grace and glory,\" Trump said.\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he added.Who Trump spoke to: The other closely watched aspect of the Paris trip was how much interaction Trump had with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was also in Paris for the Armistice Day commemorations.Leading up to the trip, Trump and the Kremlin had been contradicting each other on whether he and Putin would talk. Trump said nothing was scheduled, while the Kremlin said the two would speak briefly during a lunch Sunday.In a statement, the White House said Trump discussed \"key issues\" with Putin, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the lunch with world leaders in Paris.\"The leaders discussed a variety of issues, including the INF (nuclear treaty), Syria, trade, the situation in Saudi Arabia, sanctions, Afghanistan, China, and North Korea,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"They had very good and productive discussions during the two-hour lunch.\"Sanders's statement contradicts claims from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian news agency Interfax that Trump and Putin did not discuss the nuclear treaty. Trump has said he intends to withdraw from the Cold War-era agreement.While in Paris, Trump also spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan about the killing of U.S.-based journalist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi. The conversation happened after Erdogan said publicly for the first time that Turkey has audio of Khashoggi's dying moments and has shared it with the Americans.\u00a0SPONSORED CONTENT - RAYTHEONAn intuitive, fully open intelligence platform, Raytheon\u2019s FoXTEN connects soldiers to multiple intelligence sources\u2014facilitating better, faster tactical decision-making in the field.

The military provides other logistics and intelligence to the coalition, and the United States sells the Saudis billions of dollars in weapons.\"By finally ending refueling missions for Saudi bombers, the Trump administration is admitting our joint operation in Yemen has been a disaster,\" Sen. Chris MurphyChristopher (Chris) Scott MurphySenators return to Washington intent on action against Saudis Howard Dean: Democratic Party getting younger as GOP gets \u2018older and whiter\u2019 We need a bipartisan issue to unite us. Saudi Arabia is that issue MORE (D-Conn.) said in a statement. \"So why only cut off refueling support? Why are we still helping the Saudis with targeting? Why are we still selling them the bombs at a discount? Now that it's no longer a secret that the war in Yemen is a national security and humanitarian nightmare, we need to get all the way out. I will join several other colleagues to introduce a resolution in the coming weeks to do just that.\"\"Ending U.S. refueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft is an encouraging step towards ending U.S. involvement in the Yemen civil conflict,\" Democratic Reps.

The U.S. should be squarely focused on alleviating this crisis and doing everything we can to encourage an end to the civil conflict that has exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation. Picking sides and supporting the Saudi-coalition is contrary to those goals. In addition to ending refueling efforts, the United States should pause sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia.\"The trio added that Congress should pass their bill to end all military support to the coalition in the lame duck session.More than two-dozen former Obama administration officials said in an open statement Sunday that all support must end. While the Obama administration started support for the coalition, the former officials said that \"unfortunately, our approach did not succeed in limiting and ultimately ending the war\" and that Trump made the situation worse by \"removing restrictions we had put in place.\"\"The war in Yemen is a full-blown crisis,\" they wrote. \"We unsuccessfully tried conditional support to the coalition. This administration has demonstrated the folly of unconditional support. Now, we must cease support altogether.\"\u00a0ONE WAY TO MARK VETERANS DAY?: A Republican lawmaker who was defeated in last week's midterm elections wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal blaming the late Sen.

He died in August after being diagnosed with brain cancer a little more than a year earlier.\u00a0HIDDEN MISSILES: A Washington-based think tank said Monday it has identified 13 of an estimated 20 undeclared missile operating bases in North Korea.The bases, which researchers at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Beyond Parallel identified using commercial satellite imagery, are scattered throughout North Korea and can be used for all classes of missiles, the report said.The first of the 13 bases Beyond Parallel released information on was Sakkanmol, a base for short-range ballistic missiles and one of the closest to the border between North and South Korea.\"North Korea's decommissioning of the Sohae satellite launch facility, while gaining much media attention, obscures the military threat to U.S. forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases,\" the report said.Surprising?: Despite Trump's declarations that North Korea is \"no longer a nuclear threat,\" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un never agreed to stop producing missiles.Indeed, in his 2018 New Year's address, he promised the exact opposite.\"The nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles,\" Kim said.It's a statement some alluded to in their analysis Monday.\"It is NOT deception,\" tweeted MIT professor and nuclear proliferation expert Vipin Narang, reacting to the New York Times headline about the report. \"Kim literally ordered ballistic missiles to be mass produced on New Year's day 2018. He never offered to stop producing them, let alone give them up. Ever. He is doing exactly what he said he was going to do.\"Why it still matters: One of the sticking points in negotiations has been that the United States wants North Korea to provide a full accounting of its nuclear and missile program, including declaring all sites such as the ones identified in the report.The findings underscore the difficulty the United States faces in negotiating with North Korea as the bases would \"presumably have to be subject to declaration, verification and dismantlement in any final and fully verifiable denuclearization deal,\" the report said.Latest trouble: The report is just the latest example of difficulties the Trump administration has been having with North Korea.Over the weekend, The Hill's Ellen Mitchell took a look at some of the other recent setbacks, including Secretary of State Mike PompeoMichael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 Lawmakers struggle with how to punish Saudi Arabia | Trump regrets not visiting Arlington for Veterans Day | North Korea deports detained American Corker: 'A price needs to be paid' for Khashoggi's murder White House eyeing ways to remove Erdo\u011fan foe G\u00fclen from US: report MORE's canceled meeting and Pyongyang's threat to restart nuclear development if the United States doesn't lift sanctions.Catch up on that story here.\u00a0ON TAP FOR TOMORROWMichael Griffin, under secretary of Defense for research and engineering, will speak about \"Reenergizing the Missile Defense Enterprise\" at 9:30 a.m. at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. https://bit.ly/2z8o24cThe Foundation for the Defense of Democracies will host \"The Battlefield of Today and Tomorrow: Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare\" conference starting at 10 a.m. Speakers will include B.
