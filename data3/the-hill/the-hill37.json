All of them were found and\u00a0removed by authorities before they could detonate.Three of those explosives were intercepted at locations in New York, including packages sent to the Clinton family, Democratic mega-donor George Soros and CNN's Manhattan headquarters.\u00a0\"New Yorkers have never succumbed to fear or intimidation, and today will be no different,\" Cuomo said in the statement. \"We are tough, we are resilient, and we will not allow terrorist thugs to change the way we lead our lives.\"Out of an abundance of caution, I am deploying additional National Guard soldiers and directing State law enforcement to double security at vital transportation assets across New York.New Yorkers have never succumbed to fear or intimidation, and today will be no different. pic.twitter.com/8XxY7jWYTJCuomo in the statement said he is directing state law enforcement to double security at all\u00a0\"vital assets\" in the state, including\u00a0major airports, roads, tunnels bridges and transit centers.A suspicious package was also sent to Cuomo's office on Wednesday, but authorities ultimately concluded it was not a bomb and was unrelated to the other packages.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
