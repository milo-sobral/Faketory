The diplomats are still trying, by the way, as we speak,\u201d Mattis said at the United States Institute of Peace. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to try to find any option. And if any of you have any good ideas please send me an email. It seems like every nut in America has my email address, I\u2019m sure you can find it and send it to me.\u201dTrump announced earlier this month that he intends to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia.The treaty, which has been credited with helping end the Cold War, bans nuclear and conventional ground-launch ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between\u00a0300\u00a0and 3,400\u00a0miles.The United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty since 2014, first by testing a banned missile and then by deploying the missiles.Moscow denies the charge and says it is the United States that is violating the treaty with its missile defenses in Europe.On a trip to Moscow last week, national security adviser John Bolton reaffirmed Trump\u2019s decision\u00a0to withdraw and said the United States would file an official notice in \u201cdue course.\u201dUnder the terms of the treaty, the United States has to formally notify Russia, kicking off a six-month withdrawal process.Because Trump made his announcement without official action, some have raised the suggestion that he could be using a negotiating tactic to try to bring Russia back into compliance. Bolton, though, has insisted Trump\u2019s announcement is not a negotiating ploy.Prior to Trump\u2019s announcement, Mattis indicated he wanted to convince Russia to come back into compliance rather than have the United States withdraw.\u201cRussia must return to compliance with the INF Treaty or the U.S. will need to respond to its cavalier disregard of the treaty\u2019s specific limits,\u201d Mattis said in early October. \u201cThe United States is reviewing options in our diplomacy and defense posture to do just that in concert with our allies, as always.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mattis declined to discuss the military options the United States has without the treaty in place, saying that is Trump\u2019s decision.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into too much detail, but there are options both symmetric and asymmetric,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cBut I am not committing to anything right now. That\u2019s a grave decision that the president will take counsel from all of us and it will be up to President Trump.\u201dMattis added that Trump \u201chates\u201d nuclear weapons.\u201cHis views on nuclear weapons, I think, are pretty well known,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cHe hates \u2018em.\u201dView the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
