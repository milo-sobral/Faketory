The man is delusional. By any measure, the results of the Nov. 6 midterm elections are a triumph for Democrats and a huge setback for Donald Trump and Trumpism. No spin, just the facts. Despite having to run in heavily GOP-gerrymandered districts, Democrats regained control of the House by winning as many as 37 seats. In addition, Democrats flipped at least seven governorships, won back control of seven state legislative chambers and flipped more than 370 state legislative seats.Even in the Senate, it looks like Republicans will end up with at most 52 seats (even though Trump crowed about winning 55). Given the disastrous map Democrats faced to begin with, that in itself is a small miracle. Plus, Democrats made up for losing North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana by winning Nevada and, as looks more and more likely, Arizona \u2014 with Florida and Mississippi still to be decided, by recount or runoff. Overall, 13 million more people voted for Democrats than Republicans in Senate races.Democrats won one other all-important contest, too: fundraising. We\u2019re used to Republican candidates raising more money than Democrats. Not this time. Democrats thumped Republicans in most House and Senate races \u2014 nowhere more than in Texas, where Beto O\u2019Rourke hauled in a presidential eye-popping total of $70.2 million in small donations.

Democrats also achieved a trifecta \u2014 control of the governor and both house of the state legislature \u2014 in six more states: Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, New York and Maine. Which will give Democrats a huge advantage in the 2020 presidential election and reapportionment in 2021.But for Democrats the biggest winners of all were women. In the new Congress, the ranks of Democratic women will grow to more than 100, while the number of Republican will shrink to about 13. Even more significant are who those women represent: the first two Muslim women in Congress; the first two Native American women; the first two Latinas to represent Texas; the first African-American women to represent Connecticut and Massachusetts; new female members from the red states of Kansas, Iowa, Florida, Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma. Congress will never look, or be, the same.Add it all up and, no matter what President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE claims, Democrats can rightfully call results of the 2018 midterms a \u201cBlue Wave.\u201d From top to bottom, this election was, by his own admission, a referendum on Trump.
