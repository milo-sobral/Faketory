The original ban between Moscow and Washington resulted in 2,692 missiles being destroyed.Former President Obama decided to stay in the deal. Trump did not offer a timetable for when the actual withdrawal would take place.This would not be the first nuclear deal Trump withdrew from. The president pulled out of the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran, although that deal was an agreement and not a treaty and placed nuclear restrictions on Iran alone.\u00a0The last president to withdraw from a major arms treaty was former President George W. Bush in 2002, when he pulled out of the nuclear Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\u00a0The news comes right ahead of national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s trip to Moscow to meet with top Russian officials.\u00a0The announcement follows a trend for the Trump administration in which the White House enacts tough policies against Moscow, including sanctions on Kremlin officials, while the president adopts rosy language toward Russian President Vladimir Putin as he defends himself against claims collusion with Russia during the election.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
