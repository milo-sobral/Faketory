{"id": "Lawmakers, forecasters: Election Day up for grabs", "paragraph": "Lawmakers, party leaders and election prognosticators cautioned Sunday that control of Congress\u00a0is far from settled heading into Election Day on Tuesday,\u00a0as Democrats and Republicans sought to make a final pitch to voters.Early voting numbers are skyrocketing around the country, with Republican votes slightly edging out Democratic ones as of Wednesday, according to NBC. But a\u00a0pair of polls\u00a0released Sunday morning showed Democrats with a 7- and 8-point lead on generic ballots.\u00a0Changing projections, high voter enthusiasm, and\u00a0not-too-distant memories\u00a0of President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE defying polls that showed him trailing late in the 2016 presidential election have party officials and lawmakers urging supporters not to take anything for granted when they weigh how to vote this year.\u201cNo one should be surprised if [Democrats] only win 19 seats.

Democrats must\u00a0flip 23 seats currently held by Republicans in order to secure a simple majority.But generic ballot surveys, including those released Sunday, are\u00a0showing Republicans closing the margins on congressional balloting compared to last month.\u00a0Improving numbers, coupled with favorable polls in individual Senate races, have burnished GOP hopes to retain a slim majority in the House and add to their majority in the Senate.But party leaders are warning voters that nothing is guaranteed in order to keep voter turnout high on election day.Calling the election \"tight,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel on Sunday told ABC that \"Election Day voting is going to determine the balance of the House.\"A\u00a0CBS News tracker poll\u00a0released Sunday\u00a0laid out three potential scenarios for this week's elections. The most likely scenario, the poll found, is that Democrats\u00a0end up with 225 seats, slightly more than the 218 needed to secure the majority in the House.That poll has a 13-seat margin of error, however, leaving open the possibility that Republicans could retain a narrow majority if voter turnout breaks their way, said Anthony Salvanto, CBS News's elections & surveys director.\u00a0The poll's second most likely scenario sees Republicans minimize their losses in suburban districts, and winning 220 seats to maintain a two-seat majority.\u201cDemocrat enthusiasm is definitely there,\u201d McDaniel said on ABC. \u201cWe are seeing that in the early voting, in all of these key House and Senate races and Republicans have been matching.\"McDaniel pushed back on the notion that Republicans are resigned to losing control of the House, despite Trump\u00a0acknowledging\u00a0it \"could happen\" during a campaign rally late last week.
