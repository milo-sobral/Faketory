Standard and Poor's 500 index fell 3.1 percent, also sliding below its 2018 open.The Nasdaq composite tanked 4.43 percent as a Silicon Valley sell-off brings the tech-heavy index deeper into a formal correction.U.S. stocks have slid throughout October as traders brace for higher interest rates, deepening trade tensions and moderating corporate earnings to slow the economy. I break down the latest market meltdown here.The background:\u00a0What comes next:\u00a0We've got two weeks until Election Day, and the stock market could play a major role in Trump's public statements and messaging ahead of the crucial midterms. The president takes market movements very personally and has a tendency to bash the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell during sell-offs. The bank won't hike again until after the election, but Republicans could face challenges pitching the strong economy if Trump is railing about the market.\u00a0LEADING THE DAYWaters among Dems targeted with potential explosives:\u00a0Rep.

But it's always taken a monumental effort, and a lot depends on the political climate and, as you know, I've seen miracles happen before,\" Hatch said, when asked if the floated tax proposal could pass.Pressed if thought there could be a vote during the lame-duck session, Hatch added: \"You can't count out the Congress. \u2026[But] it would be highly unlikely.\"Background: Trump\u00a0said earlier this week\u00a0that he would push for a vote on a second round of tax cuts after the midterm elections that\u00a0will include a 10-percent reduction for middle-class Americans.The Hill's Jordain Carney has more here.\u00a0Conservative group: Kamala HarrisKamala Devi HarrisElection Countdown: Abrams ends fight in Georgia governor's race | Latest on Florida recount | Booker, Harris head to campaign in Mississippi Senate runoff | Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority Booker to campaign for Dem in Mississippi Senate runoff On The Money: Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority | Grassley opts for Finance gavel, setting Graham up for Judiciary | Trump says China eager for trade deal | Facebook reeling after damning NYT report MORE tax credit plan would cost $2.7 trillion:\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)'s proposed new tax credit for lower- and middle-income taxpayers would make the federal tax code more progressive but\u00a0lower federal revenue by $2.7 trillion over a decade, according to\u00a0an analysis\u00a0released Wednesday by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.Under\u00a0Harris's proposal, families making under $100,000 would be eligible for a new refundable tax credit. The credit would be in the amount of up to $6,000, phasing out as income increases, and taxpayers could choose to receive it annually or in monthly installments.Harris, who is thought to be a possible 2020 presidential candidate, argues that the credit would help middle-class households who are struggling with increases in the cost of living while wages have been flat. She\u00a0touted her proposal\u00a0as she campaigned for Democrats in Iowa, home to the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. The Hill's Naomi Jagoda\u00a0breaks it down here.\u00a0Majority of Americans say their finances haven't improved since Trump election:\u00a0A majority of Americans say that their financial situation has not improved since the 2016 election, according to\u00a0a Bankrate survey released Wednesday.Of those surveyed,\u00a017 percent said they were worse off now than two years ago\u00a0and\u00a045 percent said their situation has not changed.
