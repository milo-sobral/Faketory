Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"Bowers was charged Monday with 29 felony counts, including 11 counts for using a firearm to commit murder.Gab has defended itself as \"the home of free speech online,\" and says it bears no responsibility for the shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday.The company did not delete any of Bowers's previous racist or violent posts per its free speech policy, which does not moderate most content. That stance has led to neo-Nazis and white supremacists flocking to the site after being barred from other social media platforms and earned Gab criticism from anti-hate groups.The shooting in Pittsburgh is bringing new scrutiny on the platform and has already led a number of tech service providers to finally cut ties with Gab.GoDaddy, which hosted its domain, and PayPal, both ended service to the social media company on Monday.The company is looking for an alternative hosting platform to get back online but is currently down.The crackdown on Gab parallels the social media fallout after the Unite the Right rally, which brought white nationalists to Charlottesville, Va. in 2017.Read more here.\u00a0WE PROMISED YOU MORE ON CHINA:\u00a0The Justice Department on Tuesday unsealed charges against a group of Chinese intelligence officers, alleging that they hacked into a series of\u00a0private companies' computer systems in the U.S. and abroad as part of an effort to steal\u00a0sensitive commercial aviation data.Zha Rong, Chai Meng and seven other co-conspirators worked to steal intellectual property and other sensitive\u00a0data from over a dozen\u00a0companies so that\u00a0China could develop a turbofan engine\u00a0\"without incurring substantial research and development expenses,\" according to the indictment.\"Members of the conspiracy targeted, among other things, companies in the aerospace and other high-technology industries, and attempted to steal intellectual property and confidential business information, including information that was commercial in nature,\"\u00a0reads the indictment that\u00a0was filed last week but unsealed on Tuesday.Read more here.\u00a0MAKE AMERICA HACKED AGAIN:\u00a0The hacking group behind the costly cyberattack that shut down many of the city of Atlanta's computer systems earlier this year is primarily targeting U.S.-based organizations, according to a new report.Cybersecurity firm Symantec on Tuesday said the SamSam hacking group, which specializes in ransomware attacks, has gone after at least 67 different targets this year, mostly located in the U.S.\"Of the 67 organizations targeted during 2018, 56 were located in the U.S. A small number of attacks were logged in Portugal, France, Australia, Ireland, and Israel,\" according to a Symantec\u00a0blog post, which called the group \"highly active.\"Researchers found that SamSam is going after a range of sectors -- but healthcare organizations appeared to be the most common target.\"SamSam targeted organizations in a wide range of sectors, but healthcare was by far the most affected sector, accounting for 24 percent of attacks in 2018,\" the blog post reads.\u00a0Read more here.\u00a0BETTER, BUT STILL NOT GREAT:\u00a0States have stepped up their cybersecurity protections ahead of the Nov. 6 midterms, but are still lacking in some areas, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0released Tuesday by cyber experts.The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that 40 states have invested more than $75 million in improving election security since the 2016 elections.Seventeen states are running security tests and adopting upgrades to improve their cybersecurity ahead of next month's elections, according to the CSIS report.Still, the group's scorecard said the average grade for state election cybersecurity is a C-, and that states with toss-up Senate elections next month average an F for their security measures.\u00a0Read about it here.\u00a0MIDTERM MISINFO ON TWITTER:\u00a0Twitter's new events page for the coming midterm elections are highlighting false information.The new tool aggregates tweets about politics and the midterm elections, organized in two tabs \"Top Commentary\" and \"Latest\" tweets on the matter.The events page shows many verified accounts tweeting accurate information, as well as unverified accounts. But in some cases the tool is elevating tweets peddling incorrect information.Conservative internet personality Bill Mitchell falsely claims in a tweet which made Twitter's tool that \"Democrats paid for the Honduran Caravan\" and incorrectly characterizes it as a \"marauding band of fighting age men.\"Read more here.\u00a0THE THREAT OF FAST, CHEAP INTERNET:\u00a0A Republican Federal Communications Commission Commissioner called publicly provided broadband a \"threat\" to the First Amendment, referring to the threat of censorship.\"I would be remiss if my address omitted a discussion of a lesser-known, but particularly ominous, threat to the First Amendment in the age of the Internet: state-owned and operated broadband networks,\" FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly said\u00a0during a speech\u00a0he gave last Wednesday, but that was not reported on until this week by Motherboard.O'Rielly claimed that \"municipalities such as Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, N.C., have been notorious for their use of speech codes in the terms of service of state-owned networks, prohibiting users from transmitting content that falls into amorphous categories like 'hateful' or 'threatening,'\" citing research by Professor Enrique Armijo of the Elon University School of Law.

New America proposed the concept in a report last week.She said the department could create an \"alumni-type network\" where it would offer to continue the training of former government staffers, or create a reserve like that for the National Guard.But Manfra hedged the possibility of any of her proposals becoming reality, saying they were just \"concepts\" and that talks in the department are in the \"early stages.\"\u00a0BLAME IT ON CHINA AND/OR RUSSIA:\u00a0About half of all cyberattacks are coming from Russia or China, according to a\u00a0new\u00a0report released Tuesday.Cybersecurity firm Carbon Black said that out of the 113 incidents researched by it and its partners, 47 were tied to those two nations. North Korea, Iran and Brazil were the source for a significant percentage of the other attacks.The report also found that about two-thirds of incident response professionals surveyed believe that cyberattacks will impact next month's midterm elections.\"More and more, state actors are using compromised infrastructures sold on the dark web as command and control outposts,\" one incident response professional said in the report. \"Since these infrastructures are the site of a variety of other commodity activities, investigators will often block those actions and assume the case is closed. Meanwhile, the state actors remain behind running more covert operations.\"\u00a0TAXING THE TECH:\u00a0The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday is raising concerns about digital services taxes, after the United Kingdom on Monday\u00a0announced plans to move forward with such a tax\u00a0on large technology companies.\"The American business community supports international dialogue on ways to modernize the international taxation system to adapt to changes in the global economy,\" Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steven MnuchinSteven Terner MnuchinOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 Border deployment 'peaked' at 5,800 troops | Trump sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | Senators offer bill to press Trump on Saudis | Paul effort to block Bahrain arms sale fails On The Money: Senior GOP senator warns Trump against shutdown | Treasury sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | HQ2 deal brings new scrutiny on Amazon | Senate confirms Bowman to Fed board The Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Sponsored by Delta Air Lines \u2014 Trump sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi killing | Insurgents seek female challenger to Pelosi for Speakership | Broward County finishes machine recount MORE. \"However, unilateral European actions will erode trust and lessen the prospects for international agreement; indeed, we now see governments outside of Europe considering similar actions.\"The U.K. announced plans on Monday for large internet companies to pay a tax starting in 2020 of 2 percent of revenues from users in the country. A number of other countries have also been looking at imposing a digital services tax, due to frustrations that internet companies are largely untaxed in their jurisdictions.Read more here.\u00a0MY NAME IS CHUCK SCHUMER AND I'D LIKE TO BUY AN AD:\u00a0Facebook's attempts to create transparency and stop the flow of misinformation in political ads on its platform are easy to manipulate, a new investigation shows.The company recently introduced a feature that shows who purchased an ad on its platform by showing \"paid for\" ahead of the name of the person or organization that bought the political ad on the advertisement. But purchasers can easily manipulate the information shown, a\u00a0Vice News investigation\u00a0found.The news outlet purchased 100 ads and attributed their payment to U.S. senators, which Facebook's systems reportedly approved without any pushback.Lawmaker's reaction:\u00a0\"If Facebook is going to claim to verify who's paying for political ads, they need to actually do the work,\" Sen.
