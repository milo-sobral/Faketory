United, we can keep it that wayTrump has called himself a \"nationalist\" multiple times, sparking criticism over the term's connection to white supremacy and xenophobia. Trump doubled down on the label last week\u00a0during a press conference when a reporter asked him whether he believes he empowers white nationalists by using the term.\"You know, they have a word,\" Trump said at a rally in October. \"It sort of became old-fashioned. It\u2019s called a nationalist. And I say, 'Really, we\u2019re not supposed to use that word?' You know what I am? I'm a nationalist. ... Use that word.\"\u00a0Trump has also railed against \"globalists,\" a term that many right-wing conspiracy theorists\u00a0use as a veiled reference to Jewish people.\u00a0Kasich, one of the president's sharpest GOP critics, has left the door open to a possible 2020 run against Trump, saying last week that he doesn't \"know\" if he'll run but believes \"there is a legitimate chance for a third-party candidate.\"\u00a0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
