Though O'Rourke raised a record $38 million in the third fundraising\u00a0quarter, recent polls have shown Cruz consistently building a lead in the statewide race.But an increased turnout could be enough to tip the races in smaller House districts, according to strategists.Mary Beth Rogers, who was campaign manager to the late Ann Richards, the last Democratic Texas governor, said O\u2019Rourke will need to do about 5 to 6 points better than 2016\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTexas history curriculum to emphasize that slavery played 'central role' in Civil War Election Countdown: Abrams ends fight in Georgia governor's race | Latest on Florida recount | Booker, Harris head to campaign in Mississippi Senate runoff | Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority Texas education board approves restoring Hillary Clinton in history curriculum MORE did in some parts of the state in order to give a boost to some of the competitive House races.Other Democrats argue that some voters\u00a0who traditionally vote straight-ticket Republican might be tempted to vote for O'Rourke \u2013 and in doing so could give a second look to other Democrats down the ballot.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Democrats could choose straight-ticket voting, an option being pushed\u00a0by the party that\u00a0will be eliminated after the November election.The party is\u00a0feeling especially good about their prospects in three districts that voted for Clinton in 2016 but also backed\u00a0their Republican Congressmen.These House races also have another common thread: the Democrats running are all first-time candidates who\u00a0have outraised their respective GOP challengers by at least $1 million in the past fundraising quarter.Democrats can still achieve the magic number of 23 seats for the House majority without flipping seats in Texas. But many view those districts as bellwethers that could serve as a barometer for the national political environment and prospects for a blue wave.Two of these seats, currently held by Culberson and Sessions, represent largely suburban districts including parts\u00a0of big cities where demographics have greatly shifted over the years.Culberson\u2019s Houston-area district has a growing Hispanic population, while\u00a0Sessions\u2019s north Dallas district has both a sizable Hispanic and African-American population.Culberson is running against Democratic attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, while Colin Allred, a civil rights lawyer and former NFL player who worked in the Obama administration, is challenging Sessions, the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee who didn\u2019t even face a Democratic opponent in 2016.Recent New York Times/Siena polls show both races are in a dead heat, with the\u00a0GOP incumbents holding slim leads\u00a0that fall within the margin of error.\u00a0Hurd also represents an expansive swing district,\u00a0but unlike the other two races, he\u00a0appears better positioned to hang on for a third term in a district that Democrats had\u00a0occupied until 2014.The majority Hispanic district spans 800 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border from El Paso to San Antonio, a vast area that includes pockets of cities\u00a0but also rural areas,\u00a0making it\u00a0more challenging for\u00a0Democrats.Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force intelligence officer, is still getting plenty of help from the national party, and\u00a0she\u2019d make history as the first Filipina-American elected to Congress should she win.But Jones is 15 points behind Hurd, according to a NYT/Siena poll earlier this month.Some Democrats even believe O\u2019Rourke\u2019s energy could help longer-shot races that President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE easily carried outside of Austin where Democrats have fielded strong challengers.GOP Rep.

And the president is holding a campaign rally in Houston on Monday for\u00a0Cruz, which could also help\u00a0elevate some House members.Ultimately, much could depend on\u00a0how much O\u2019Rourke can run up the score among Hispanic voters, who will be especially critical in the\u00a0Sessions, Culberson and Hurd districts.An increase in Hispanic turnout, combined with other members such as college-educated women and moderate suburban voters frustrated by the president, could easily tip the scales to Democrats, observers\u00a0said.\u201cThey\u2019ll need him to be successful in the Hispanic community and suburban areas with college-educated white women,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, political science professor at the University of Houston. \u201cDemocrats can perform better than expected if they can get those folks out.\u201dSuch a coalition could spell doom for Republicans, even if it's not enough statewide to help O'Rourke prevail over Cruz.\u201cIf O\u2019Rourke can get Democrats to polls to also pull the lever for the rest of the party, that helps Democratic candidates for Congress,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist who managed Sen.
