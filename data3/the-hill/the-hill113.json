This enforcement regime is totally inadequate for scam artists and we need do more to separate enforcement of carelessness and other mistakes from more sinister actors.\u201d\u201cAs the scourge of spoofed calls and robocalls reaches epidemic levels, the bipartisan TRACED Act will provide every person with a phone much needed relief,\u201d Markey added. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple formula: call authentication, blocking, and enforcement, and this bill achieves all three. I thank Chairman Thune for his partnership on this effort, and look forward to seeing this legislation through to its passage.\u201dBesides imposing fines, the bill would direct the FCC to help protect subscribers from receiving unwanted calls or texts, extend the window for FCC enforcement to three years after the robocall is placed, bring together several agencies and offices to report to Congress how to improve illegal robocall prevention and require providers of voice services to adopt call authentication technologies.\u00a0The website YouMail, which monitors robocalls and provides a blocking service estimates that 5.1 billion robocalls were made in October alone, amounting to\u00a02,000\u00a0per second. However, it is unclear how many of those were illegal.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
