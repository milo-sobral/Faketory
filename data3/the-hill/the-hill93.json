to federal investigators despite cooperating with the Russia investigation.\u201cI\u2019m going to be criminally charged,\u201d Jerome Corsi, a conservative commentator and conspiracy theorist, said during a YouTube livestream. \u201cAs of today, right now, I expect to be indicted.\u201dCorsi, who said he tried to cooperate with the investigation, claimed that his \u201cmind was mush\u201d after speaking with investigators, and alleged that they set up a \u201cperjury trap\u201d for him by not allowing him to see what documents and statements they were referring to during his \u201cinterrogation.\u201d However, he did not go into the full details about his version of events, stating that he wants to know what the indictment looks like before he does.His livestream comes after NBC News reported in late October that Mueller was scrutinizing whether Corsi was aware that WikiLeaks had obtained emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers and whether he may have shared

WikiLeaks would release the hacked emails because he \u201cfigured it out,\u201d and not because of any contact he had with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.He said that \u201cto the best of my recollection,\u201d he did not meet with Assange or have sources connect him with Assange, somebody he considers a \u201cjournalist.\u201dFBI agents, according to Corsi, served him a subpoena on Aug. 28,\u00a0even though he had been working with the Mueller investigation for the past two months.He said that he had handed over two computers to the special counsel, and also granted the office access to his cell phone, emails and Twitter account.Corsi also sought to undermine the legitimacy of the Mueller investigation, claiming that the Department of Justice was being run \u201cby criminals.\u201d\u201cMy crime really was that I dared to support President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to go to prison for the rest of my life because I dared to oppose the Deep State.\u201dCorsi\u2019s attorney David Gray also declined to comment to The Hill.Corsi used the livestream as an opportunity to raise money for his legal fees, appealing to viewers to help pay for his legal expenses through PayPal, while stating that at his age of 72, he could die in prison.And he read aloud messages from supporters in the chat accompanying the livestream.Even during the livestream, the well-known conspiracy theorist pushed baseless claims, including that Democratic mega-donor George Soros is secretly funding the migrant caravan that is heading to towards the

past few weeks, with several associates of Trump\u2019s longtime confidante facing subpoenas and being interviewed by the special counsel\u2019s team.Mueller\u2019s queries center around whether Stone

information he shared about a potential WikiLeaks release was all publicly available.\"I had no advance notice of the source or the content of allegedly hacked emails nor of John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails published by WikiLeaks,\" Stone said in a statement to The Hill last week. \"If the decision to file charges is made on the basis of facts and evidence then I believe no charges will be
