And since the beginning of the year, Democrats and their supporters have outspent Republicans by a margin of more than $125 million.The expanded battlefield encompasses much more conservative terrain where\u00a0President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE\u00a0had double-digit margins of victory.
