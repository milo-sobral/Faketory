It scares others & puts safety at risk. If you see suspicious activity, call 911 immediately. pic.twitter.com/cqkLdKRxrOA deadly shooting on Saturday at a synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead just days after a Florida man mailed more than a dozen packages with pipe bombs to CNN and prominent Democrats.Metzger said the student seemed surprised that the costume caused a stir and that \u201cthere was no ill intent on this student\u2019s part.\u201dMetzger added that the costume idea was \u201cnot the smartest thing to do.\u201dThe police chief said his department received one phone call regarding the costume but expected to get more.The student was later released after police questioned him.
