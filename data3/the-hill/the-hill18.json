The next thing you know, regardless of party, they are holding hands with the king.\"\"I\u00a0don't get why the Saudis hold such sway. Especially now. And not just over our politicians,\" he continued. \"When [Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman came to the U.S. in the spring, he was fawned over by titans of industry, from MIT to Silicon Valley.\"Smerconish went on to characterize the Saudi explanation of Khashoggi's death as not credible. Saudi officials said Friday that Khashoggi died after a fight broke out in the consulate between the journalist and more than a dozen Saudi personnel.\"[W]hy are these our partners?\" Smerconish asked Saturday, before criticizing U.S. support of Saudi forces against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\"Why is it in the best interest of the United States to pick sides in a sectarian dispute that's been unresolved since the year 632?\"The CNN host's comments followed sharp criticism of the Saudi explanation from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who questioned the evolving nature of the official story and other inconsistencies.\"First we were told Mr. Khashoggi supposedly left the consulate and there was blanket denial of any Saudi involvement. Now, a fight breaks out and he\u2019s killed in the consulate, all without knowledge of Crown Prince,\u201d Sen.
