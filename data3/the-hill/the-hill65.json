{"id": "The Memo: Trump and Obama face off in midterms", "paragraph": "ATLANTA \u2014 President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE and former President Obama are in a full-blown proxy war centered on Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.The president and his predecessor have been rallying supporters in critical states in the final days of the campaign. They have also been offering dramatically different visions of what the United States is, and what it should be.Explosive racial issues are sharpening the tensions.At a Pensacola, Fla., rally on Saturday evening, Trump said that Andrew Gillum, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Florida, was \u201cnot equipped\u201d for the job. Two days previously, he had called Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governor of her state.Both Abrams and Gillum are black, and Trump\u2019s comments provoked allegations that he was making racially coded attacks. Abrams said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d Sunday that Trump\u2019s claim about her was \u201cvapid and shallow.\u201dMeanwhile, the nation\u2019s first back president is connecting present-day political quests with the struggles of the civil rights movement.On Friday, he held a rally with Abrams at Morehouse College, the historically black institution from which Martin Luther King Jr. graduated.Rep. John LewisJohn  LewisPelosi, potential challenger Fudge hold 'candid' discussion Incoming Michigan Dem will not back Pelosi Marcia Fudge under spotlight as Pelosi Speaker fight heats up MORE (D-Ga.), who marched alongside King in the 1960s, was also among the speakers.When Obama spoke, he stressed, \u201cJohn Lewis didn\u2019t sit back and say, \u2018Man, I hope some day things get better.\u2019 It happened because some people marched, some people mobilized, some people organized \u2026 And when they won the right to vote, people voted to make a better history.\u201dVoting rights are one of the major issues in Abrams\u2019s race against Republican Brian Kemp. As Georgia\u2019s secretary of State, Kemp oversees elections in the Peach State, something which appears to critics as a clear conflict of interest.The suggestion of racial animus has marked the dynamics between Trump and Obama from the beginning.Trump\u2019s journey from the world of real estate and television to politics was fueled in part by his promotion of the false \"birther\" theory that Obama was not born in the United States. Obama mocked Trump for this at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, where Trump was present.In the closing days of the midterms, the contrast in the audiences that are drawn to see the 44th and 45th presidents could hardly be more stark.The Pensacola crowd of several thousand for Trump on Saturday included only a handful of black attendees. The audience that packed a 6,000-capacity basketball arena at Morehouse for Obama the previous night was not quite so uniform but was overwhelmingly black.But there are other, broader issues at play in the Trump-Obama faceoff, too.In Atlanta, Obama aimed repeated volleys of criticism at Trump while avoiding mentioning him by name.There have been, Obama said, \u201cincessant, non-stop attempts to divide us with rhetoric that is designed to make us angry and make us fearful \u2026 to pit us against one another.\u201dObama also made an apparent jab at Trump\u2019s propensity for exaggeration and inaccuracy, saying he had never before seen \u201can approach in which folks at the highest levels of office \u2026 will just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly just make stuff up \u2014 just say things that they know are not true.\u201dTrump in his own criticism sometimes stresses other Democrats more than Obama.

Obama\u201d and suggested that the Democrat\u2019s crowds were smaller than his own.Trump also boasts of undoing the 44th president\u2019s legacy in areas from business regulation to the nuclear deal with Iran.More broadly, Trump asserts that the United States grew timorous and apologetic under Obama's administration. He claims that he is restoring national pride and assertiveness.In Pensacola, he wove this argument into a call for voters to support the GOP in Tuesday\u2019s elections.Even as he talked up his achievements, Trump insisted that progress was \u201cvery fragile\u201d and could easily be reversed if the Democrats were to take over Congress.Trump has hit the campaign trail in earnest leading up to Tuesday. He is nearing the end of a stretch of 11 rallies that were scheduled in the six days leading up to Election Day.His tone is clearly aimed at energizing the base that carried him to victory in 2016 \u2014 a message that was underlined on Sunday when it was announced that conservative media figures Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity would join him at his final rally, set for Cape Girardeau, Mo., on Monday evening.Obama has campaigned in Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida in addition to his Friday rally in Atlanta.On Sunday, he was scheduled to appear in his home base of Chicago and in Indiana, where incumbent Sen. Joe DonnellyJoseph (Joe) Simon DonnellyTrump to nominate former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler as next EPA administrator Indiana New Members 2019 2020 politics make an immigration deal unlikely in lame-duck MORE (D) is facing a stiff challenge from Republican Mike Braun.Among the loyal supporters of both men, there is open disdain for the other person.In Pensacola, Paula St. Pierre, who described herself as a \u201cmilitary wife of 25 years,\u201d said that she had felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Obama\u2019s time in the White House.In Atlanta, Mandy Simmons, an airport worker, complained that Trump had made the United States a \u201claughing stock\u201d internationally.Whether Trump or Obama will be more effective for their party is anyone\u2019s guess.Obama enjoys significantly higher favorability ratings than Trump in most opinion polls. But even during his time as president, he struggled to translate his personal popularity into votes for Democratic candidates in midterm elections.Trump\u2019s approval ratings have ticked up to some of the highest levels of his presidency \u2014 but he is coming off historic lows. Some Republicans also worry that Trump\u2019s abrasive style will turn off voters in suburban districts that could determine control of the House.By Tuesday night, partisans of one side or the other will see reason to celebrate their president \u2014 whomever they consider that to be.\u00a0The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
