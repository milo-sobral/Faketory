The group said such a change would undermine \u201cDemocratic unity, coherence and effectiveness.\u201d\u201cNow that we are finally in the Majority, it will be baffling to the public and self-defeating to block the Caucus\u2019 choice on the floor, either through a formal change to the Rules or an informal abandonment of the Caucus,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\u00a0\"We should stand by the Rules which have served us well rather than alter our long-standing Rules and court strategic mischief and endless ballots.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The letter is signed by 14 House Democrats, including Reps.

The current threshold for winning the nomination requires just a simple majority of the caucus.The idea was championed by a small yet vocal group of Democratic insurgents who are fighting for generational change at the very top of the party and want to nudge the 78-year-old Pelosi out of the leadership ranks.Initially, 11 Democrats signed a letter pushing for the rule change before the midterm elections, but they ultimately withdrew their effort for the sake of party unity. Last week, nine Democrats again signed on to a similar letter.Rep.
