{"id": "Failed Israeli operation in Gaza sparks new violence", "paragraph": "A failed\u00a0Israeli operation in Gaza has sparked a new explosion of violence, with Israeli forces killing three Palestinians and launching more than 30 airstrikes into the strip as Hamas-affiliated militants launch hundreds of rockets into Israel.The\u00a0outbreak is one of the most significant escalations in violence since 2014, according to The Associated Press.At least seven\u00a0Israelis were wounded by the rockets from Gaza, including one 19-year-old Israeli soldier who is in critical condition, according to the country's national rescue service.\u00a0Israeli forces have not provided details about the operation that led to the increased violence, reporting only that seven Palestinians, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli officer were killed Sunday night during the\u00a0botched operation\u00a0in Gaza. They were apparently targeting\u00a0a commander of Hamas's military wing, BBC reported.Gaza militants\u00a0said the rockets are retaliation for Israel's \u201caggressive crime,\" The Washington Post reported.One of the Israeli airstrikes on Monday destroyed Hamas's television station, al-Aqsa Television, according to multiple reports.\"The station broadcasts harsh incitement against Israel and its citizens, showing methods on how to carry out attacks against civilians and soldiers,\" the\u00a0Israel Defense Forces\u00a0spokesperson said in a statement, according to Haaretz.United Nations\u00a0Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov on Monday tweeted that the U.N. is \"working closely with #Egypt & all concerned to ensure that #Gaza steps back from the brink.\"\"The escalation in the past 24hrs is EXTREMELY dangerous & reckless,\" he added. \"Rockets must STOP, restraint must b shown by all! No effort must be spared to reverse the spiral of violence.\"The U.N. in July warned that an outbreak of violence between\u00a0Hamas and Israel was \"almost a certainty,\" citing the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip caused in part by the Israeli blockade.The previous outbreak in violence\u00a0came in March, when Palestinians began\u00a0protesting at the border between Gaza and Israel against the conditions brought on by the Israeli blockade. Thousands of\u00a0Palestinians\u00a0have been\u00a0wounded and\u00a0more than\u00a0200\u00a0killed over the course of\u00a0the protests, which are still ongoing, the\u00a0BBC reported.\u00a0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
