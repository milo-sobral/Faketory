You owe it to them.

Anytime a party is out of office it is attracted to a newer, bolder message.\u201d\u00a0Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said she doesn\u2019t think the age of some would-be candidates is problematic for the party.\u00a0Cardona pointed to 2016, when Sanders was \u201cable to attract a massive following of young people,\u201d and nearly beat Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTexas history curriculum to emphasize that slavery played 'central role' in Civil War Election Countdown: Abrams ends fight in Georgia governor's race | Latest on Florida recount | Booker, Harris head to campaign in Mississippi Senate runoff | Why the tax law failed to save the GOP majority Texas education board approves restoring Hillary Clinton in history curriculum MORE in the Democratic primary.\u00a0Sanders was able to tap into a sentiment that Clinton represented the tired Washington establishment, and he positively electrified swaths of young voters.\u00a0During that race, the Vermont senator lured millennials to the race by talking about issues such as free public college, single-payer health care and campaign finance reform.\u00a0A survey conducted in early 2016 by pollster Frank Luntz showed that young voters selected Sanders when asked which politician they respected the most. Sanders even beat former President Obama, who at 57 is 20 years his junior, 31 percent to 18 percent, according to the poll. \u00a0\u201cI think what\u2019s important more than age is for the candidates to authentically speak to and make a connection with voters in every state and in every community and offer a platform of new ideas and real solutions for the problems the country is facing,\u201d\u00a0Cardona said.\u00a0Kofinis said that whoever wins will need to run a nimble, 21st century campaign that doesn\u2019t rely on a playbook from previous years.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the age of the candidate but the age of their ideas and the age of their actual campaign,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf you didn\u2019t understand how bad of an idea that was, you\u2019ll probably be on a losing campaign,\u201d the strategist said.\u00a0Much of what happens in the 2020 race is dependent on what happens in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0midterms, strategists said.\u00a0If Democrats take over the House, strategists predict the party will look a lot younger and more diverse and age will be nothing but a number.\u00a0\u201cIf and when we take over the House\u00a0on Tuesday, there will be a whole new generation of Democrats in Congress as well as across state legislatures around the country,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cThey will be more female, young, diverse, and beautifully reflective of the country we live in today.\"\u00a0View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
