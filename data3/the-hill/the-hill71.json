{"id": "NRA president dropped from GOP rally in city hit by school shooting ", "paragraph": "The Indiana\u00a0Republican Party has dropped National Rifle Association (NRA) President Oliver North from a rally Sunday in a city that\u00a0suffered a school shooting last May.\"Oliver North will not be visiting Noblesville\u00a0today, as it simply would have been the wrong place and wrong time,\" Indiana Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer told The Hill in a statement.A student reportedly shot a classmate and teacher last May in Noblesville West Middle School, miles from the venue for the rally. The Hill was referred by an NRA spokesperson to North's office.\u00a0The rally will continue without North\u00a0and will feature Senate candidate Mike Braun (R), Gov. Eric Holcomb and other GOP candidates.Noblesville Mayor\u00a0John Ditslear (R) had\u00a0agreed with Hupfer, telling the\u00a0Indiana Star\u00a0that the community had not sufficiently healed from the shooting to have a \"pro-gun speech.\"Ditslear noted that he supports the Second Amendment and that he did not know of North's visit in advance.\u00a0The Indiana Republicans originally said North's\u00a0appearance was canceled because of a scheduling conflict, before Hupfer issued his statement to the paper, according to the Star.Previously, parents in the group Noblesville Stands Together had pushed back against North appearance, saying it would be in \"poor taste.\"\u201cHonestly, this was insensitive and hurtful,\u201d Nathan Lambert, whose child was at Noblesville West Middle School during the shooting, told the paper.\u201cI\u2019m a Republican and I\u2019d like to know why my State Party thought this was a good idea.\u201d\u00a0So...@braun4indiana is bringing the President of the NRA to a town where a school shooting happened\u2026 Unbelievable\u2026 I\u2019m a Republican, and I am disgusted.
