Rick Scott's legal team. Scott's team is alleging voter fraud and illegal activity during the recount in Broward County, Florida.\u201cI am urging, because of the highly public nature of this case, to ramp down the rhetoric,\u201d Tuter said, according to The Associated Press.\u201cIf someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\u201dTuter told both sides to come together on a compromise.
