Federal Election Commission, which dramatically curbed Congress\u2019s ability to restrict political spending by outside groups.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like the decision. I think we have ample authority as legislative bodies to control how campaigns are run,\u201d he said.\u00a0Graham won points with conservative activists during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing.\u201cThis is the most unethical sham since I\u2019ve been in politics,\u201d Graham yelled at his Democratic colleagues on the panel, pointing to Sen.

There have been times where he\u2019s been a conservative, there have been times when he\u2019s been more liberal.\u201dGraham has long argued that presidents should be given broad deference in appointing judges to the federal courts.\u00a0He voted for former President Obama\u2019s two picks to the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\u00a0Several Senate colleagues see Graham\u2019s increasingly close relationship with Trump \u2014 and his angry outburst in defense of Kavanaugh \u2014 as part of an effort to shore up his base ahead of his 2020 reelection.\u00a0Graham was considered vulnerable to a Tea Party challenge in 2014 after prominently pushing comprehensive immigration reform the year before, but he won the primary with 56 percent of the vote against divided opposition.\u00a0One Republican source said there\u2019s a chance that Graham could follow up on the Kavanaugh debate by punishing Sen.
