{"id": "Pavlich: Arizona doesn\u2019t deserve Sinema", "paragraph": "We\u2019re one week away from the 2018 midterm elections. In the months leading up to Nov. 6, we\u2019ve seen predictions of a \u201cblue wave,\u201d \u201cred wave,\u201d and everything in between. But as voters head to the polls Tuesday, one thing is clear: Arizona doesn\u2019t deserve Democratic Rep. Kysten Sinema as senator.On the surface, Sinema has presented herself to voters as a moderate Democrat willing to work with Republicans, and even President TrumpDonald John TrumpMia Love pulls ahead in Utah race as judge dismisses her lawsuit Trump administration denies exploring extradition of Erdo\u011fan foe for Turkey Trump congratulates Kemp, says Abrams will have 'terrific political future' MORE, on a number of issues.But Sinema\u2019s history tells a different story.During the early years of the Bush administration and shortly after the United States was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Sinema said during a radio interview that she \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d if Americans went overseas to join the Taliban in Afghanistan.\u201cI don\u2019t care if you want to do that, go ahead,\u201d Sinema said.At the time of the comments, American troops were dying fighting Taliban terrorists and are still fighting them today.Sinema\u2019s anti-American attitude didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cHer biggest anti-war event was a February 15, 2003, protest in Patriot\u2019s Square Park in Phoenix. Flyers, as first reported by CNN\u2019s KFile, distributed by an anti-war group led by Sinema depicted a U.S. soldier as a menacing skeleton inflicting \u2018U.S. terror\u2019 in Iraq and the Middle East,\u201d CNN recently reported. \u201cIn her activism for that event, Sinema was willing to work with all groups, including a local anarchist group that helped organize the rally.\u201dNot only did she encourage Americans to fight against the U.S. on behalf of the Taliban, she depicted U.S. troops as terrorists.Sinema has been repeatedly asked about the comments and the flyers, but won\u2019t say whether she regrets them. She\u2019s also refused to address them in debates, despite Arizona having a heavy military population.In addition to Sinema\u2019s abhorrent record of promoting the terrorist organization behind 9/11, it\u2019s become clear she isn\u2019t remotely a fan of the Arizona constituents she wants to represent.For years, Sinema built her political career in far left circles. During the annual Netroots Nation conference in 2010, Sinema classified Arizona as the \u201cmeth lab of democracy.\u201d\u201cThe states are the laboratories of Democracy and then my state, Arizona, is very clearly the meth lab of democracy,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cI cannot take credit for that line, someone at the Daily Show wrote it but I\u2019m happy to steal it and use it all the time.\u201dIn 2011, she gave a speech to a Democratic group in Texas and portrayed Arizona as the \u201ccrazy\u201d state.\u201cOver the past several years, people have watched what was happening in Arizona, and been like, \u2018Damn, those people are crazy,\u2019 \u201d Sinema said. \u201cArizona is the state of the five C\u2019s. So, cattle, copper, cotton, citrus and climate. Those were the five things our state historically made its money off of. But I would add a sixth C \u2026 It\u2019s called \u2018crazy,\u2019 because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in my state, is pure craziness. Pure craziness.\u201dMost recently, Project Veritas revealed Sinema warned against discussing gun control because Arizonans \u201cwill actually shoot you.\u201d She was also exposed by staffers for faking her moderate platform.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very conservative people in Arizona and so [Sinema] can\u2019t alienate the conservative or moderate conservative voters by being super pro. She is pro-choice. She is very liberal, she\u2019s progressive,\u201d field organizer Lauren Fromm said.Sinema\u2019s opponent, Republican Rep. Martha McSallyMartha Elizabeth McSallyArizona New Members 2019 House GOP returns to Washington after sobering midterm losses Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Raytheon \u2014 First lady's office pushes for ouster of national security aide | Trump taps retired general as ambassador to Saudis | Mattis to visit border troops | Record number of female veterans to serve in Congress MORE, has a very different record.\u201cDuring her 26-year military career, she deployed six times to the Middle East and Afghanistan, flying 325 combat hours and earning a Bronze Star and six air medals. She broke barriers for women and girls everywhere \u2014 becoming not only the first woman in U.S. history to fly a fighter jet in combat\u2014 but the first woman to command a fighter squadron,\u201d her campaign website states. \u201cMartha was deployed to Saudi Arabia on 9/11 and was a part of the leadership team that planned and executed the initial air campaign in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. She also oversaw combat search and rescue operations over Southern Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201dMcSally respects the constituents she is running to serve and is supported by Republicans from across the right side of the political spectrum. For decades, former Sen. John McCainJohn Sidney McCainCindy McCain takes aim at Trump: We need a strong leader, 'not a negative Nancy' McCain would have said \u2018enough\u2019 to acrimony in midterms, says Cindy McCain Trump nominates Jim Gilmore for ambassador post MORE (R-Ariz.) served as an inspiration to McSally. She is endorsed by Trump and former President George W. Bush.Arizona deserves better than Sinema on Election Day. McSally is the candidate who will best serve Arizona voters, and the United States of America, in Washington.Pavlich is the editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
