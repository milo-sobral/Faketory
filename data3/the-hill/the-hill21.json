However, he lamented that Trump did not do so sooner and\u00a0voiced\u00a0a desire for the president to\u00a0be more consistent in his efforts to bring Americans together.\"I\u2019m hoping that this is going to make it clear to him that what he has done heretofore, as far\u00a0as a lot of\u00a0this rhetoric, really is counterproductive, it is un-American, it is what a president should not be doing,\" Brennan said.\"What he said today is what a president should be doing,\" he continued. \"But follow up on those words with actions, and with his future comments. I\u2019m hoping maybe this is a turning point.\"Republicans and Democrats alike have widely condemned Wednesday's\u00a0attempted attacks and pleaded for cooler heads to prevail in political discourse.However, both sides were quick to point fingers at the other for escalating the political climate to such hostile levels.Democratic leaders\u00a0pointed to Trump's attacks\u00a0on Democrats at campaign rallies and elsewhere, where he has labeled the Democratic Party an \"angry mob\" and\u00a0derided news outlets as the \"enemy of the people.\"Republicans have pointed to comments from Democrats urging their supporters to confront politicians over Trump administration policies and seized on subsequent protests from liberal activists.Updated on Oct.\u00a025 at 7:35 a.m.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
