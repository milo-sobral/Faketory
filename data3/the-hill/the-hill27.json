Speaking at a White House event, Trump, who has previously criticized all of the people targeted this week, denounced the threats \"abhorrent\" and \"egregious\" and called for unity.Democratic leaders, though, slammed Trump's words as \"hollow.\" \"Time and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerFacebook reeling after damning NYT report Schumer warns Trump to stay out of government funding negotiations Schumer predicts Nelson will 'continue being senator' if 'every vote counted' MORE (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy PelosiNancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiDem women rally behind Pelosi How this year\u2019s freshmen can save the Congress \u2014 and themselves Single-payer health care is better than ObamaCare  MORE (Calif.) said in a joint statement.\u00a0Some worry calls for unity may be too late. The attempted bomb attacks come in the final stretch of a midterm year mired by heated rhetoric and finger-pointing by both parties at their opponents.Democrats largely blame Trump for the polarization in politics and rhetoric that stems from his attacks against political opponents. Meanwhile, Republicans -- and Trump himself --\u00a0have cautioned voters ahead of the midterms about a liberal \"mob,\" specifically citing the protests that emerged after the contentious Supreme Court confirmation of Brett KavanaughBrett Michael KavanaughThe Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Sponsored by Delta Air Lines \u2014 White House to 'temporarily reinstate' Acosta's press pass after judge issues order | Graham to take over Judiciary panel | Hand recount for Florida Senate race Graham set to take over Judiciary Leverage the new US International Development Finance Corporation to compete with China MORE.It's unclear what effect the bomb threats will have on the midterms. But it's unlikely to change the attitudes of the GOP or Democratic bases, who appear more motivated than ever to mobilize for their party's candidates.\u00a0Read more from The Hill's Morgan Chalfant about those threats raising new fears.\u00a0\u00a0Wave watchThe race for Rep. Pete SessionsPeter Anderson SessionsTexas New Members 2019 Congress is going to make marijuana moves McCarthy defeats Jordan for minority leader in 159-to-43 vote  MORE's (R-Texas) suburban swing district has become ground zero for the battle over health care and pre-existing conditions, The Hill's Lisa Hagen reports from north Dallas. Sessions's Democratic opponent Colin Allred has sharpened his attacks on pre-existing conditions and the GOP congressman's numerous votes to repeal ObamaCare. It's a strategy being employed across other swing districts and states as Democrats fight for the House majority. For his part, Sessions is highlighting a non-binding resolution he proposed last month that would give access to affordable health care for those with pre-existing conditions.In an interview with The Hill, Allred called that resolution a \"political stunt,\" arguing that voters will see it that way. Meanwhile, Sessions lashed out at Allred and Democrats' for their \"shameless attacks\" regarding pre-existing conditions. The GOP congressman went further by arguing that Democrats will hurt economic progress by implementing \"Medicare for All.\"\u00a0Race has moved to the forefront in a number of campaigns in this year's midterm elections that rivals that of past cycles, The Hill's Reid Wilson reports. There've been more blatant overtures of racial animus and strategists on both sides of the aisle link that to Trump. One example in California: GOP Rep.

Key races in the Sunshine State will serve as an early referendum on the president's standing, specifically in the nationally watched Senate and governor's races. The Hill's Max Greenwood dives into Florida's political landscape from Orlando.\u00a0Trump claimed Wednesday in a tweet that GOP candidates would \"totally protect people with pre-existing conditions,\" trying to provide some cover for Republicans who voted to repeal ObamaCare. Republicans have been trying to show that they support protections for those with pre-existing conditions as they weather repeated attacks from Democrats on ObamaCare repeal. It's become a prominent issue in this cycle's top Senate races, where Republicans are looking to protect their slim 51-49 majority.\u00a0\u00a0Survey says\u2026SHOCK POLL out of South Dakota: Rep.
