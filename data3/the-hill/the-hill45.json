And the challengers would undoubtedly win,\" Conway wrote in The Washington Post with attorney Neal Katyal.Conway, a self-described conservative, and Katyal, a self-described liberal, argued that the authors of the Constitution's 14th Amendment were \"simple and clear\" in drafting a provision that meant anyone born in the United States is a citizen of the country.The two lawyers further cited a 1898 Supreme Court Case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the court\u00a0ruled that\u00a0\"all children here born of resident aliens\" were granted citizenship by birth, except in cases of foreign occupiers and foreign diplomats.\"Neither of those narrow exceptions supports what proposes to do by executive order,\u201d Conway and Katyal wrote. \u201cHe is threatening, with the stroke of a pen, to declare certain people who are born in the United States ineligible for citizenship\u00a0\u2014 despite the plain words of the 14th Amendment.\"A key difference, critics have noted, is that in the\u00a01898 case, both parents had\u00a0established permanent residence in the U.S.In an interview with Axios\u00a0released Tuesday, Trump\u00a0vowed to end citizenship\u00a0for children of nonlegal residents born in the U.S., a change he proposed during the 2016 campaign, even though birthright citizenship is enshrined\u00a0under the 14th Amendment.Trump\u00a0did not say when he would sign such an order, but\u00a0it is the latest example of\u00a0the president\u00a0deploying hard-line rhetoric\u00a0to gin up discussion about\u00a0immigration in the closing stretch of the midterms.Speaker Paul RyanPaul  Davis RyanHow this year\u2019s freshmen can save the Congress \u2014 and themselves Democrat Katie Porter unseats GOP's Mimi Walters Amazon fleeced New York, Virginia with HQ2 picks MORE (R-Wis.), Sen.

You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,\" Ryan told Lexington, Ky., radio station WVLK on Tuesday.Conway and\u00a0Katyal wrote that the unconstitutionality of Trump's proposal serves as a reminder that the Constitution can be a unifying document in politically divisive times.\"The fact that the two of us, one a conservative and the other a liberal, agree on this much despite our sharp policy differences underscores something it is critically important to remember,\" they wrote. \"Our Constitution is a bipartisan document, designed to endure for ages. Its words have meaning that cannot be wished away.\"Conway has repeatedly drawn attention on social media during Trump's tenure, frequently sharing news articles and opinions on Twitter that are critical of his wife's boss.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
