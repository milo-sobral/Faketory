{"id": "Virginia attorney general announces investigation into possible clergy sex abuse", "paragraph": "Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring announced Wednesday that he is conducting an investigation into sex abuse by Catholic clergy and any cover-ups that have taken place of that abuse in his state.\u201cLike so many Americans, I read the grand jury report on clergy abuse in the Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania, and I felt sick,\" Herring said\u00a0in the announcement\u00a0of the investigation.\u00a0\"It made me sick to see the extent of the damage done, the efforts to cover it up, and the complicity and enabling that went on by powerful people who should have known better and should have done more to protect vulnerable children.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume the behavior and the problems are limited just to Pennsylvania or to one diocese,\" Herring added, referencing the report from a Pennsylvania grand jury of extensive allegations of the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy.\"If there has been abuse or cover-up in Virginia like there was in Pennsylvania, I want to know about it, I want to root it out, and I want to help survivors get justice and get on a path to healing,\u201d he said.As a part of the investigation, Herring launched the Virginia Clergy Abuse Hotline and www.VirginiaClergyHotline.com.The announcement comes\u00a0one day after\u00a0the attorney general for the District of Columbia made public that\u00a0it\u00a0is opening an investigation into sexual abuse by the Catholic clergy in the area's archdiocese.Virginia is the 13th state to launch a similar investigation, according to The Washington Post.Washington, D.C., Cardinal Donald\u00a0Wuerl\u00a0resigned earlier this month\u00a0over his role in covering up multiple sexual abuse scandals in Pennsylvania and D.C.Herring told the Post that he is a churchgoer and\u00a0framed\u00a0the effort as a way to\u00a0help the church\u00a0act as a positive force.\u00a0\"Few people in our lives are more trusted and, therefore, more powerful than our faith leaders, especially as we\u2019re growing up,\" he said. \"We look to them for strength in difficult times, spiritual growth and maturity, understanding.\u00a0I know this is true in my own life.\"Sadly we have learned that trust and power can be abused and exploited, even in communities of faith, even against children,\u201d he said.View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are \u00a92018 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."}
