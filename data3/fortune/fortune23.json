{"id": "How Elon Musk Is Winning Over the Tesla Shorts", "paragraph": "Even before Tesla wowed investors Wednesday with its first significant quarterly profit\u2014$312 million\u2014Wall Street could sense a change in the tides.First, Tesla had suddenly announced Monday that it would report third-quarter earnings this week, instead of in early November as it usually does. The rush seemed out of character for a company that as recently as August was the most shorted stock in America, and whose CEO, Elon Musk, expressed his distaste for earnings calls by berating analysts and then trying to take Tesla private.The hurry, analysts figured, could only mean one thing: Tesla\u2019s earnings would be good, really good, and Musk didn\u2019t want to wait to release them. \u201cDoes anybody think that Tesla decided to move up its earnings release date because of bad news?\u201d wrote Andrew Left of Citron Research, a notorious short-seller, in a report published Tuesday.It was a remarkable reversal for Left, who had been loudly shorting\u2014or betting against\u2014Tesla stock for more than two-and-half-years, until this week, when he declared in the report that he was now long Tesla stock. \u201cPlain and simple, Tesla is destroying the competition,\u201d Left wrote. \u201cLike a magic trick, while everyone is focused on Elon smoking weed, he is quietly smoking the whole automotive industry.\u201dIn a letter to investors Wednesday, Musk\u2014who has publicly raged against short-sellers\u2014offered concrete metrics of Tesla\u2019s success.The Model 3, which short-sellers warned would bankrupt Tesla, is now helping to drive its profitability, following through on Musk\u2019s promise to turn a profit starting this quarter and every quarter after that.Now, not only is Tesla\u2019s Model 3 the best-selling electric car on the market, it\u2019s the single best-selling car in America, period, by dollar sales. With Tesla producing 4,300 of the car each week, on average, the Model 3\u2019s gross profit margin has climbed above 20%, and Tesla\u2019s overall automotive gross margin is nearly 26%\u2014not far from the holy grail of 30% that Left and other investors dream of.Tesla\u2019s stock rose 12% in after-hours trading following its earnings report.Before the third quarter quarter, Tesla had only turned a profit twice since it went public\u2014once in 2016, when it netted $30 million, and once in 2013, when it generated just more than $11 million in net income.Its $312 million profit in the third quarter is a big swing from the prior quarter, when it lost almost $718 million. From here, investors expect Tesla\u2019s profit to grow exponentially: $112 million in 2019, which stands to be its first profitable year, a gain that is expected to balloon 1055% in 2020, to roughly $1.3 billion.Profitability also puts Tesla\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio\u2014a popular stock valuation metric\u2014in the realm of Earth. While Tesla\u2019s PE was impossible to calculate as long as it was losing money\u2014you can\u2019t divide by a negative number\u2014it\u2019s now trading at about 94 times its expected earnings in 2019. While that\u2019s still extremely high (and several times the average PE ratio for the S&P 500), it\u2019s not so far above the valuations of other high-growth tech stocks. Take Netflix, for example, which trades at 115 times estimated 2018 earnings, and 73 times 2019 earnings. Amazon\u2019s PE, meanwhile, is 96 for this year\u2019s expected earnings and 67 for 2019.Now all Musk has to do is prove that Tesla deserves investors\u2019 newfound bullishness."}
