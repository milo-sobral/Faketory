{"id": "Cyber Saturday\u2014Facebook's 'War Room' Is a Marketing Ploy", "paragraph": "In response to mounting criticism from consumers, citizens, and lawmakers, Facebook is pursuing a public relations blitz. The media giant wants to change people\u2019s perceptions about how it is handling the scourge of misinformation and concomitant threat to elections presented by its websites and apps.Enter the \u201cwar room.\u201d Facebook invited journalists from a number of publications\u2014Fortune included\u2014to visit a cramped conference room on the company\u2019s Menlo Park campus inside which a squad of 20-or-so employees is tasked with valiantly defending democracy around the globe\u2014from the U.S., to Brazil, and beyond. The walls and desks are cluttered with video screens and computer monitors. Around them, Facebook\u2019s freedom fighters huddle, clattering away on their keyboards, stemming a tide of malicious, politically-motivated influence campaigns.One moment in Fortune reporter Jonathan Vanian\u2019s account of the war room made me grin widely. A Facebook executive, Samidh Chakrabarti, director of elections and civic engagement for the company, tells Vanian that having everyone in the same room allows for \u201cface-to-face\u201d communication and quick decision-making. A few paragraphs later, we learn why Facebook does not plan to invite collaborators from other misinformation-besieged Silicon Valley companies, like Twitter and Reddit, to take seats in the room. It is easier for these groups to collaborate \u201cvirtually\u201d rather than physically, says Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy. Hmm\u2026Facebook\u2019s war room seems, to this columnist, like a PR stunt. It is reminiscent of the cybersecurity fusion centers that banks and other companies set up to dazzle visitors. Such displays are mostly for show, as the New York Times conveys in an unrelated story. They, you know, look cool.I do not mean to denigrate Facebook\u2019s efforts entirely. To be fair, the company is trying to address the many problems that plague its platforms. And the war room does serve an important purpose: making the company\u2019s behind-the-scenes battles more tangible for its own employees, for regulators, and for the public. Hopefully it does help quench disinformation.Still, the tidy image of the war room comes across as a bit of marketing misdirection. After all, the walls of this room extend far, far beyond Menlo Park. Ask any journalist. As the Times\u2019 editorial board notes in a recent op-ed, Facebook effectively relies on news reporters as an army of unofficial, unpaid, outsourced content moderators, helping to root out spammers, trolls, and propagandists. Companies like Facebook \u201chave all the tools at their disposal and a profound responsibility to find exactly what journalists find\u2014and yet, clearly, they don\u2019t,\u201d the Times writes.Indeed, the real war room has no walls.***Last week I warned readers about the many ways Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s recent report about Chinese spy chips smells foul. Just yesterday Apple CEO Tim Cook took the unprecedented move of personally calling for Bloomberg to retract the story. So far Bloomberg has not backed down. We\u2019ll continue to track this story and its fallout.Have a great weekend.Robert Hackett@rhhackettrobert.hackett@fortune.comWelcome to the Cyber Saturday edition of Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily tech newsletter.

The Justice Department charged a Russian woman named\u00a0Elena Khusyaynova, 44, with conspiracy to defraud the United States by interfering in the upcoming 2018 election. Prosecutors say she managed financed for a foreign influence operation called \u201cProject Lakhta.\u201d The group allegedly spread misinformation online to incite controversy over divisive social and political issues.Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! Facebook believes that a recently disclosed breach, the biggest known in the company\u2019s history, was caused by spammers, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing unnamed sources familiar with the company\u2019s investigation. The hackers apparently posed as a digital marketing agency.Google censored search engine. Google CEO Sundar Pichai doubled down on the company\u2019s interest in a censorship-friendly search engine for China, codenamed \u201cProject Dragonfly.\u201d Pichai said Google wants to provide people access to information while complying with laws around the globe. Asked about employees\u2019 protests over this project as well as over potential U.S. military work, Pichai said \u201cwe don\u2019t run the company by holding referendums.\u201dYou\u2019re hired.\u00a0Stripe has hired Niels Provos, an ex-Googler who spearheaded many security initiatives, such as Safe Browsing, at the search giant, as its head of security. Intel\u2019s new chief software security officer, Window Snyder, has plans to boost the chipmaker\u2019s security in the wake of the Meltdown and Spectre chip flaws. And Microsoft has hired Hemma Prafullchandra, ex-chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm HyTrust, as the tech chief for its Microsoft 365 security and compliance team.I\u2019d like to buy the world a coke.\u00a0Share today\u2019s Data Sheet\u00a0with a friend:http://fortune.com/newsletter/datasheet/Looking for previous Data Sheets? Click here.After the curtain. The Washington Post has published the\u00a0final opinion piece of Jamal Khashoggie, the\u00a0Saudi Arabian dissident and journalist who is reported to have been dismembered and decapitated at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul by more than a dozen Saudi agents. (Saudi Arabia, after denying involvement for 18 days, now claims Khashoggie died in a fistfight gone wrong.) Khashoggie, in his posthumous column, calls for alternatives to the \u201cstate-run narrative [which] dominates the public psyche\u201d in the Middle East. I include this excerpt because the Web has become a global battleground for information warfare, and securing cyberspace requires a recognition of that fact.The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power. During the Cold War, Radio Free Europe, which grew over the years into a critical institution, played an important role in fostering and sustaining the hope of freedom. Arabs need something similar.3 Ways Russian-Linked Entities Stoked Controversy on Facebook, Twitter by Jonathan VanianNew Effort to Stop Human Trafficking Uses Data Analysis to Follow the Money by Renae Reints3-D Printed Guns Aren\u2019t as Dangerous as You Might Think by Avi ReichentalHackers Can Use Your Household Appliances to Trigger Large-Scale Power Outages by Erin CorbettThe Cat-and-Mouse Game Between Regulators and Data Stewards by Robert HackettFacebook Has a New Plan For Fighting Voter Suppression Tactics\u2014And For Once It Involves Deleting Lies by David MeyerInto the aether.\u00a0Popular Mechanics\u2019 latest installment of \u201cWe\u2019ve Been Wrong Before,\u201d a series that explores debunked scientific theories, offers a history of aether, a mysterious element invented by the ancients whose idea persisted, in various forms, until the 19th century. Two scientists,\u00a0Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, famously failed to prove the invisible material\u2019s existence in an 1877 experiment that involved attempting to measure light moving at different speeds. Albert Einstein would build on the duo\u2019s findings with his theory of relativity. As Popular Mechanics writes, aether, echoes of which resonate in today\u2019s concepts of dark energy and dark matter, \u201cmay be the most enduring imaginary concept in scientific history.\u201dAt least that we know of\u2026"}
