{"id": "Cyber Saturday\u2014A CEO-Felling Privacy Bill, Facebook Ad Scandals, Chinese Spy Charges", "paragraph": "Consumers who have clamored for data privacy reform since Equifax\u2019s ransacking and, more recently, Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica debacle have cause to celebrate.On Thursday, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a prominent privacy hawk, unveiled a draft bill that seeks to slap harsher penalties on companies\u2014and chief executive officers\u2014who run afoul of new rules that expand government oversight of the tech industry. The Consumer Data Privacy Act, as the bill is tentatively named, takes its cue from Europe\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, which can fine companies up to 4% of their global, annual revenues for infractions. But Wyden\u2019s bill goes even further; in addition to that penalty, the proposed law would jail chief execs up to 20 years with individual fines reaching as high as $5 million for CEOs who knowingly mislead regulators.If GDPR has teeth, Wyden\u2019s proposal has fangs\u2014set on the jugulars of corporate heads. The proposed law would require big firms\u2014ones with revenues exceeding $1 billion or ones that store data on more than 50 million consumers or their devices\u2014to submit \u201cannual data protection reports\u201d to the government that lay out their data-securing practices. It would force companies to comply with \u201cdo not track\u201d policies while offering alternative payment options to consumers, such as subscription fees instead of ad-supported \u201cfree\u201d models. And it would boost the power of the Federal Trade Commission, adding a tech-focused division with a broader mandate alongside an arsenal of stronger enforcement actions.Lindsey Barrett, an attorney and teaching fellow at Georgetown Law\u2019s Communications & Technology Clinic within the school\u2019s Institute for Public Representation, commented on Twitter that the proposed legislation \u201cinjects sorely needed accountability into our equif*cked information ecosystem.\u201d Wyden\u2019s own statement was a little more sanitized: \u201cIt\u2019s time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing,\u201d he said.But the proposed reform isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. Jake Williams, an alumnus of the National Security Agency who has since cofounded Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity consulting shop, said he doubts the bill will pass. \u201cEven if it does, it won\u2019t mean what you might think. It won\u2019t create a SOX style environment around cyber. Sorry,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, referring to Sarbanes-Oxley, a 2002 financial reform enacted in the wake of the Enron scandal to prevent similar accounting blowups.The main thrust of Williams\u2019 criticism is that the proposed law will box in cybersecurity practitioners and will subjugate and constrain an industry that is still finding its feet. The bill effectively grants corporate governance, risk, and compliance departments the right to \u201crule infosec,\u201d Williams warned. If it passes into law, it will likely lead to licensing requirements within the cybersecurity industry, akin to the hoops people must jump through to become certified public accountants, he said. \u201cProfessional licensure is not good for a profession this young,\u201d he said.Data privacy reform is long overdue, but this bill presents questions. Is Big Tech\u2014and its CEOs\u2014ready to face the formalized wrath of guillotine-thirsting regulators? Does the bill unfairly target CEOs, leaving other C-Suite executives and board members off the hook? Could companies end up shoving the blame onto scapegoat CEOs of subsidiary businesses? And finally, as Williams noted, is the cybersecurity industry really ready to grow up and professionalize, accepting all the responsibility and regulatory constrictions that entails?Be careful what you wish for, and have a great weekend.Robert Hackett@rhhackettrobert.hackett@fortune.comWelcome to the Cyber Saturday edition of Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily tech newsletter.

Feedback welcome.Apple drops the mic. Apple patched a number of critical flaws\u00a0in its software, such as iCloud, macOS, and iOS. The company also revealed that its new MacBook security chip, called T2, includes a feature that cuts off microphone access when the lid of a laptop is closed, making it more difficult for spies to turn these computers into eavesdropping devices.Google\u2019s bot blocker. Google is now requiring anyone attempting to log in to its online services to run javascript, a measure designed to weed out potentially malicious imposter bots. The search giant also improved its security checkup feature, added alerts related to data sharing with third parties, and instituted automatic account recovery triggers.Facebook f***ups. Facebook\u2019s advertising platform remains a garbage fire. It approved ads that undercover journalists pretended were\u00a0paid for by the Islamic State\u00a0and it allowed marketers to target people interested in \u201cwhite genocide.\u201dLips (un)sealed. The Department of Justice unsealed charges\u00a0on Tuesday against two Chinese intelligence officers and eight supposed accomplices for allegedly conspiring to steal aircraft engine designs from U.S. aviation companies. Two days later, the department unsealed charges against Fujian Jinhua, a Chinese state-owned chip maker; United Microelectronics Corp., a Taiwanese partner; and three Taiwanese nationals for allegedly stealing trade secrets from Micron Technology, the U.S.\u2019s largest memory-chip maker.Huawei infiltrated?\u00a0The Weekend Australian published a report alleging that Australian officials have received intelligence reports alleging that Chinese spies recruited staffers within Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The Chinese spies allegedly obtained secret access codes from these recruits, thereby enabling them to infiltrate an unidentified foreign network.Sureeeefire security.Share today\u2019s Cyber Saturday with a friend:http://fortune.com/newsletter/cybersaturday/Looking for previous Data Sheets?

Katie Moussouris helped create the vulnerability disclosure program at Microsoft. Jesse Kinser used her bug bounty winnings to put a down payment on a Tesla. And Alyssa Herrera, another bug bounty hunter, describes her work as \u201cquite euphoric\u2026it\u2019s like solving a hard riddle or a puzzle.\u201dIt had taken a month of work, but Jesse Kinser had finally hit the jackpot. The security researcher had managed to pull off quite a feat \u2014 stealing the source code for more than 10,000 different websites, including a big four consulting company \u2014 and the ramifications of her find were staggering.But contrary to many people\u2019s perceptions of shadowy hackers, her next move wasn\u2019t trading the data on the\u00a0dark web, or crafting exploits to sell to the highest bidder. Rather, she was faced with a different sort of daunting task: developing a responsible disclosure process to notify the thousands of vulnerable companies she\u2019d just pwned. That\u2019s right, after accessing all that code, her next job was to let the victims know exactly how she\u2019d done it \u2014 and how they could stop someone with a different set of moral guideposts from doing the same.\u00a0Hackers Extracted and Published Facebook Private Messages Grabbed Through Bad Browser Plug-Ins by Glenn FleishmanAmericans Deserve to Know Who\u2019s Behind Online Political Ads by\u00a0Dipayan Ghosh and Robert C.
