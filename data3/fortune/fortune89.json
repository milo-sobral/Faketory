And although a company spokesperson told Fortune that they\u2019ve \u201cbeen pleased to see the positive responses from consumers who appreciate the compacted product and the challenges the boxed design is meant to help solve for,\u201d many consumers have been more focused on its spigot feature and uncanny resemblance to boxed wine.Tide pod eaters have finally grown up and graduated to boxed-wine-Tide https://t.co/b4nHzGbqXt\u2014 Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) November 12, 2018Tide fights back against kids eating delicious Tide Pods, creates a delicious looking Box of Tide Wine instead.  Chug off!   https://t.co/WvGTjIUqx0 pic.twitter.com/x1wg2Cvtxe\u2014 Kmarko (@Kmarkobarstool) November 12, 2018Tide box wine pairs well with a nice sauteed Tide Free & Gentle for your weekly date night pic.twitter.com/5KNn1LikZs\u2014 jake, math lover (@watislive) November 12, 2018But no matter how enticing your internet friends\u2019 proposed food pairings may be, detergent should not be considered part of your #CleanEating meal plan.\u201cAs you can see in the product images, we\u2019ve put a large laundry detergent bottle on the side of the Tide Eco-Box,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cAnd we all know laundry detergent is meant to be used for cleaning clothes.\u201dConsidering that New York lawmakers asked the company to make its Tide pods look less enticing in February\u2014P&G had already made it taste less enticing in 2015\u2014perhaps the picture of the detergent will be deterrent enough.\u201cLike all household cleaning products, whether your Tide comes in a box or a bottle, it should be stored up and away, out of the reach of children,\u201d P&G said.(Although this may seem like a laughing matter, the Washington Post reports that more than 12,000 people called U.S. poison control centers due to exposure to laundry pods\u2014which is different from the liquid detergent in the Eco-Box\u2014last year.)According to CNN, the much-memed Eco-Box \u201cuses 60% less plastic than shipping an equivalent 150 ounce bottle of Tide since it doesn\u2019t require additional layers of cardboard boxing or bubble wrap. It\u2019s lighter and takes up less space in a delivery truck\u2014saving P&G money on shipping costs.\u201dTime will tell if any of that saved revenue will have to be used for curtailing a #TideWineChallenge."}
