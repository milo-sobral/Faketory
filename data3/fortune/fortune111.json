{"id": "Trump Says It's 'Good Time' to Shut Down Government Over Border", "paragraph": "President Donald Trump said Saturday it is a good time to shut down the government to gain leverage with Democrats to fund his demands for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\u201cThis would be a very good time to do a shutdown,\u201d Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a trip to California. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be necessary, because I think the Democrats will come to their senses, and if they don\u2019t come to their senses, we will continue to win elections.\u201dTrump suggested coverage of a \u201ccaravan\u201d of Central American migrants making its way north in Mexico added to his leverage. \u201cI think probably if I was ever going to do a shutdown over border security \u2014 when you look at the caravan, when you look at the mess,\u201d Trump said.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he expects to reach an agreement to avoid a partial government shutdown next month and address the president\u2019s demands for funds for a border wall.Funding is set to end Dec. 7 for some federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Park Service. Congress already passed full-year funding for many other federal agencies, meaning they would remain open."}
