{"id": "Sen. Wyden Proposed a CEO-Felling Data Privacy Law. Is Big Tech Ready for It?", "paragraph": "Consumers who have clamored for data privacy reform since Equifax\u2019s ransacking and, more recently, Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica debacle have cause to celebrate.On Thursday, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a prominent privacy hawk, unveiled a draft bill that seeks to slap harsher penalties on companies\u2014and chief executive officers\u2014who run afoul of new rules that expand government oversight of the tech industry. The Consumer Data Privacy Act, as the bill is tentatively named, takes its cue from Europe\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, which can fine companies up to 4% of their global, annual revenues for infractions. But Wyden\u2019s bill goes even further; in addition to that penalty, the proposed law would jail chief execs up to 20 years with individual fines reaching as high as $5 million for CEOs who knowingly mislead regulators.If GDPR has teeth, Wyden\u2019s proposal has fangs\u2014set on the jugulars of corporate heads. The proposed law would require big firms\u2014ones with revenues exceeding $1 billion or ones that store data on more than 50 million consumers or their devices\u2014to submit \u201cannual data protection reports\u201d to the government that lay out their data-securing practices. It would force companies to comply with \u201cdo not track\u201d policies while offering alternative payment options to consumers, such as subscription fees instead of ad-supported \u201cfree\u201d models. And it would boost the power of the Federal Trade Commission, adding a tech-focused division with a broader mandate alongside an arsenal of stronger enforcement actions.Lindsey Barrett, an attorney and teaching fellow at Georgetown Law\u2019s Communications & Technology Clinic within the school\u2019s Institute for Public Representation, commented on Twitter that the proposed legislation \u201cinjects sorely needed accountability into our equif*cked information ecosystem.\u201d Wyden\u2019s own statement was a little more sanitized: \u201cIt\u2019s time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing,\u201d he said.But the proposed reform isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. Jake Williams, an alumnus of the National Security Agency who has since cofounded Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity consulting shop, said he doubts the bill will pass. \u201cEven if it does, it won\u2019t mean what you might think. It won\u2019t create a SOX style environment around cyber. Sorry,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, referring to Sarbanes-Oxley, a 2002 financial reform enacted in the wake of the Enron scandal to prevent similar accounting blowups.The main thrust of Williams\u2019 criticism is that the proposed law will box in cybersecurity practitioners and will subjugate and constrain an industry that is still finding its feet. The bill effectively grants corporate governance, risk, and compliance departments the right to \u201crule infosec,\u201d Williams warned. If it passes into law, it will likely lead to licensing requirements within the cybersecurity industry, akin to the hoops people must jump through to become certified public accountants, he said. \u201cProfessional licensure is not good for a profession this young,\u201d he said.Data privacy reform is long overdue, but this bill presents questions. Is Big Tech\u2014and its CEOs\u2014ready to face the formalized wrath of guillotine-thirsting regulators? Does the bill unfairly target CEOs, leaving other C-Suite executives and board members off the hook? Could companies end up shoving the blame onto scapegoat CEOs of subsidiary businesses? And finally, as Williams noted, is the cybersecurity industry really ready to grow up and professionalize, accepting all the responsibility and regulatory constrictions that entails?Be careful what you wish for.A version of this article first appeared in Cyber Saturday, the weekend edition of Fortune\u2019s tech newsletter Data Sheet.
