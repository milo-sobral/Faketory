This isn\u2019t something I take any delight in,\u201d said Burkman. \u201cRobert Mueller is a bad guy not just because of what he does inside the courtroom, but because of what he does outside the courtroom.\u201dUnder Mueller, the special counsel\u2019s office has been investigating interference of the 2016 elections, along with possible coordination between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Mueller\u2019s investigation has so far brought charges against a number of Russian operatives and a handful of Trump\u2019s former associates.Burkman has long been a critic of Mueller, calling the investigator \u201cthe Devil\u201d and his indictments \u201can outright joke\u201d on Twitter. In February, Burkman tweeted, \u201cThe President has nothing to lose by firing Bob Mueller\u2014nothing.\u201dThe conservative commentator is no stranger to controversy, either. According to The Washington Post, Burkman has protested gay athletes in the NFL, offered $25,000 to FBI whistle-blowers with evidence of wrongdoing in the 2016 presidential election, and was physically attacked twice for his various investigations."}
