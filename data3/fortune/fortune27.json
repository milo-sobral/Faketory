In clinical trials, that method\u2014delivered through a single dose, oral drug\u2014was found to relieve flu symptoms in people who had been experiencing them for two days or less faster than a placebo (and in about the same amount of time as other existing options).\u201cIf patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of Xofluza can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms,\u201d said Shionogi in a statement on the approval.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb hailed the new treatment option while also warning that it shouldn\u2019t be considered a replacement for a flu shot given that the influenza season is now officially upon is.\u201cThis is the first new antiviral flu treatment with a novel mechanism of action approved by the FDA in nearly 20 years. With thousands of people getting the flu every year, and many people becoming seriously ill, having safe and effective treatment alternatives is critical,\u201d he said, adding the caveat that, while \u201cthere are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs to treat flu, they\u2019re not a substitute for yearly vaccination.\u201dThe Xofluza approval isn\u2019t just a milestone for flu drug development, though\u2014it\u2019s a potential landmark for FDA drug approvals at large. It\u2019s the 47th novel medicine (i.e., completely new, rather than generic or combination with an existing treatment) approved by the agency so far this year. That\u2019s just six shy of the all-time record of 53 new drug approvals in 1996, and it\u2019s not even November yet. The FDA has also set a record-breaking pace in generic drug approvals under Gottlieb, who has made rapid clearances a hallmark of his tenure.Subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations."}
