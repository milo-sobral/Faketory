{"id": "Facebook's Stock Seesaws as Investors Parse a Mixed Earnings Report", "paragraph": "Facebook\u2019s stock zigzagged after reporting third-quarter earnings that beat profit forecasts 30 cents a share but missed on revenue, as investors grappled with the company\u2019s efforts to maintain its growth while improving the social network\u2019s security.Facebook\u2019s revenue in the quarter rose 33% from the same quarter a year ago to $13.73 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts by $40 million. That revenue growth marks the slowest growth rate in Facebook\u2019s history. A year ago, Facebook\u2019s revenue grew by 47%. Two years ago, revenue was growing by 56%.That slowdown reflects a stagnation in the growth of Facebook\u2019s monthly active users, which grew by 9.6% in the quarter. A year ago, MAUs grew 15.5%. Facebook saw 1.49 billion daily active users in the quarter, which was below analyst expectations of 1.51 billion users.Facebook\u2019s stock initially fell 2% in after-hours trading, before rising as much as 5.6% as investors determined how to read the third quarter\u2019s financial performance. Once Facebook\u2019s executives began a conference call discussing earnings, the stock continued to seesaw, again falling as much as 3.2% and then rising 6.7%.Before Tuesday\u2019s earnings, Facebook\u2019s stock had fallen 19% so far in 2018, compared with a 0.5% decline in both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index.That volatility reflected the ambivalent message that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had for investors. While previous earnings calls have typically involved cheerleading rhetoric about Facebook\u2019s numerous strengths, Zuckerberg was equally clear this time in outlining the challenges the company faces.Zuckerberg rarely mentioned competitors on past calls, but this time said Facebook Watch was \u201cwell behind\u201d YouTube and that Apple\u2019s iMessage app was its biggest competitor to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Next year would be another period of \u201csignificant investment,\u201d he said, while reassuring investors that Facebook needed to \u201cmake sure our costs and revenue are better matched.\u201dZuckerberg also said that the mid-term elections next week \u201cwill be a real test of the protections we have put in place,\u201d acknowledging the role that Facebook unwittingly played in allowing Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections. \u201cWe will never be perfect, but I\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019re doing here,\u201d he said."}
