{"id": "3 Ways Russian-Linked Entities Stoked Controversy on Facebook, Twitter", "paragraph": "New charges against a Russian national for allegedly trying to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and upcoming midterms reveal the creative techniques that Kremlin-linked groups have used to sow discontent among Americans.The Department of Justice said Friday that it filed criminal charges against Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova for her alleged role with the Russian propaganda operation \u201cProject Lakhta.\u201d This operation, according to the complaint, oversaw multiple Russian-linked entities like the Internet Research Agency that lawmakers say spread fake news and ginned up controversy on Twitter and Facebook. Russia has denied any disinformation campaign.Here\u2019s some interesting takeaways from the lawsuit:The complaint alleges that the Russian groups grasped onto polarized issues like gun control, race relations, and immigration to further divide the U.S. populace. They spread both liberal and conservative viewpoints to various groups on social media, tailoring the message to each one, including choosing which publication to share on them. One unnamed Russian cited in the complaint allegedly said, \u201d If you write posts in a liberal group,\u2026you must not use Breitbart titles. On the contrary, if you write posts in a conservative group, do not use Washington Post or Buzzfeed\u2019s titles.\u201dThe Russian groups appeared to practice their own form of racism, with one member reportedly saying \u201cColored LGTB are less sophisticated than white; therefore, complicated phrases and messages do not work.\u201dThe groups apparently discovered that \u201cinfographics work well among LGTB and their liberal allies,\u201d while conservatives appeared to be indifferent to graphics.Members of the Russian entities were well versed in summarizing popular news stories and spinning them in a way that would antagonize Americans. The entities created a Facebook group dubbed \u201cSecure Borders\u201d that would aggregate news stories and then sensationalize them to draw emotional responses.Here\u2019s an example of one way the Russian groups discussed among themselves about how to spin a news story about the late John McCain\u2019s criticism of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\u201cBrand McCain as an old geezer who has lost it and who long ago belonged in a home for the elderly. Emphasize that John McCain\u2019s pathological hatred towards Donald Trump and towards all his initiatives crosses all reasonable borders and limits. State that dishonorable scoundrels, such as McCain, immediately aim to destroy all the conservative voters\u2019 hopes as soon as Trump tries to fulfill his election promises and tries to protect the American interests.\u201dThe Russian groups couldn\u2019t have spread propaganda as effectively if they used their real identities. Instead, they created fake profiles on the social media to do things like promote protests and rallies and to post divisive and hateful content.For instance, the fictitious New York City resident \u201cBertha Malone\u201d created 400 Facebook posts that allegedly contained \u201cinflammatory political and social content focused primarily on immigration and Islam.\u201dGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.The \u201cMalone\u201d personal also communicated with an unnamed real Facebook user to assist in posting content and managing a Facebook group called \u201cStop A.I.\u201d On March 9, 2018, a fake Twitter user named @JohnCopper16 attempted to influence Twitter users by commenting on President Trump\u2019s recent summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un:\u00a0\u00a0"}
