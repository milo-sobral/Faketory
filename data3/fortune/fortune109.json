{"id": "Millennials Are Disrupting Thanksgiving With Their Tiny Turkeys", "paragraph": "Small birds are having a big moment.Tiny turkeys will increasingly grace Thanksgiving tables next week, thanks to the millennial generation\u2019s ongoing campaign to remake American gastronomy. The holiday depicted by Norman Rockwell\u2014Grandma showing off a cooked bird so plump it weighs down a banquet plate\u2014is still common. But smaller families, growing guilt over wasteful leftovers and a preference for free-range fowl have all played roles in the emergence of petite poultry as a holiday dinner centerpiece.\u201cPeople are starting to understand it\u2019s not natural to grow turkeys up to 30 pounds,\u201d said Ariane Daguin, co-founder and owner of D\u2019Artagnan LLC, a wholesale and e-commerce food company in Union, New Jersey. \u201cIn general, that means they were penned up with no room to move around, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re fat like that.\u201dThere are signs that wee birds are in greater demand. Inventories of whole hens, which are smaller than males, are down 8.3 percent from a year ago, the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Whole toms, the males, are up 6.9 percent.Don\u2019t call them capons. They\u2019re not castrated chickens. Nor are they chicks. They\u2019re not babies. They\u2019re just turkeys that weigh in the neighborhood of six pounds.Bell & Evans is working with a breeder to make tiny turkeys that consumers will eat all year. Owner Scott Sechler said the new breed, which isn\u2019t yet sold publicly, \u201cfills out nicely,\u201d unlike other undersized birds, which can be bony.Still, 12- to 14-pound turkeys remain the biggest holiday seller, Sechler said. That may be because some millennials are \u201cstill going to Mom\u2019s,\u201d he said.Even Butterball LLC, which sells 30-plus-pound heavyweights, also offers a Li\u2019l Butterball that can be as small as six pounds.HelloFresh SE, in its first Thanksgiving box this year, is selling 12- to 14-pound turkeys from Cargill Inc. designed to serve 10 people who\u2019ve filled up on appetizers. And while Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Whole Foods said its most popular sizes are a classic 14 to 18 pounds, it also has a smaller version to feed four non-vegan customers.Smaller families are fueling the trend. Last year, 62 percent of American households had just one or two people, compared with 41 percent in 1960, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The proportion of single-person homes has risen, too.Karen Bell, owner of Bavette La Boucherie butcher shop in Milwaukee, said she sold half her tiny-turkey supply by Halloween. The organic birds are as little as six pounds, Bell said, because customers want less meat.\u201cFamily sizes are smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cCelebrating Thanksgiving isn\u2019t like 20-people extended families.\u201dFamilies are also more spread out than they used to be, an additional reason cooks are considering alternatives such as turkey breasts, which can be just a few pounds, or roasted chicken. Honey Baked Ham Co. has a 2.5-pound baked turkey breast for $34.95. D\u2019Artagnan sells a six-pound capon for $80 to feed five to six people.\u201cThe whole bird is not necessarily on everyone\u2019s Thanksgiving table the way it used to be,\u201d said Russ Whitman, a senior vice president at commodity researcher Urner-Barry.With smaller birds, there\u2019s less chance of tossing uneaten meat. Each year, about 200 million pounds of turkey is trashed during Thanksgiving week, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.\u201cFood waste is becoming an increasingly concerning issue,\u201d said Michael Averbook, a food and drink analyst at Mintel Group. \u201cLeftovers are part of the fun and tradition of the holidays, and this may be a small step for individuals to feel less wasteful and socially responsible.\u201dMeanwhile, home cooks are getting more adventurous with quail\u2014or even squab (young pigeon), a teeny, single-serve bird that makes for a nice Instagram post. Others would rather stick to tradition but just don\u2019t like the taste of poultry. For them, there\u2019s the prospect of tiny deer.\u201cThe first Thanksgiving had plenty of turkey but also venison on the table,\u201d Daguin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional meat.\u201d"}
