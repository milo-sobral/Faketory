An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018On the evening of Nov. 6, it appeared incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson would have to cede to his opponent, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and in the race for governor, Republican Ron DeSantis claimed victory over Democrat Andrew Gillum.As more votes trickled in, however, the margins tightened, and the state is undergoing the processes outlined by state law to ensure accuracy. The tight margins, falling below 0.5%, sparked a machine recount in both the senate and the gubernatorial elections, per state law. If the margin falls below 0.25%, state law demands a manual recount of ballots with either no selection or multiple selections for the position.Trump tweeted that ballots \u201cshowed up out of nowhere,\u201d but it\u2019s normal for some votes to arrive later. While regular mail-in ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on election day, says The Washington Post, ballots from overseas and military voters have until Friday, Nov. 16 to arrive and be counted.Hours after Trump tweeted his unsubstantiated claims of fraud Monday morning, a state judge determined that there was no evidence of fraud, denying a request for ballots and machines not in use for the recount be impounded. State Judge Jack Tuter appeared to criticize the nonchalant use of such consequential claims in his statement.\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country. We should be careful what we say,\u201d said Tuter, according to The Post. \u201cThese words mean things these days, as everybody in the room knows.\u201d"}
