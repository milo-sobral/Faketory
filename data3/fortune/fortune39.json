The triple stacks will offer triple the amount of meat, with two sausage patties and bacon, two slices of American cheese, and an egg, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.The Triple Breakfast Stacks will find their way to McDonald\u2019s menu on Nov. 1. They\u2019ll be available for a limited time.McDonald\u2019s often tries out different sandwiches or food items on its menu to gauge interest. And in some cases, that involves adding meat to its products. For instance, the company has tested in the past a new sandwich called the Grand Mac, which has more meat than the traditional Big Mac.It\u2019s unclear from the McDonald\u2019s statement how long the new menu items will be available for breakfast. The company said that it was inspired to make the charge after it found many customers tweaking orders to add more meat to their breakfast sandwiches. The Triple Breakfast Stacks are also the first new sandwich addition to the McDonald\u2019s menu since 2013 when it unveiled the Egg White Delight McMuffin.McDonald\u2019s said in its statement that it\u2019s committed to transitioning to fully cage-free eggs in the U.S. and Canada by 2025."}
