{"id": "Trump to Survey 'Incredible' Fire Damage in California Following Criticism", "paragraph": "President Donald Trump is traveling to California on Saturday to survey damage from the deadly wildfires that have killed 71 people and potentially left more than 1,000 missing, a tragedy he\u2019s blamed on mismanagement of the state\u2019s forests by its Democratic leaders.Trump returned to his criticism of forest management practices as he left the White House Saturday morning for the trip, calling for changes.\u201cIt should have been a lot different situation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEverybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing.\u201dHe\u2019s expected to tour the ruins of Paradise, a town all but leveled by the Camp Fire in Northern California. California Governor Jerry Brown said in a tweet that he and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom would join the president and welcomed his visit. In a tweet on Friday night, Trump thanked Brown and said he was looking forward to joining the two men: \u201cWe are with you!\u201dThe Camp Fire in Northern California is now the nation\u2019s deadliest wildfire in a century. Eight sets of human remains were found Friday and 1,011 people are unaccounted for in Butte County, a number that\u2019s expected to fluctuate, Sheriff Kory Honea said. The fire has burned more than 146,000 acres and was only 50 percent contained as of Friday evening, according to the Butte County Fire Department.Fires near Los Angeles have killed at least three more people.\u201cNobody\u2019s ever seen what\u2019s going on over there,\u201d Trump said in an interview to be broadcast on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d He added there \u201ccould be as many as 600 people killed, up by 400. It\u2019s incredible what\u2019s going on. And burned beyond recognition. They can\u2019t even see the bodies.\u201dTrump has been criticized for his response to the California fires after initially blaming the state\u2019s Democratic-led government for mismanaging forests. He\u2019s threatened to cut off federal funding for firefighting in the state unless its leaders improve forest management.While he has since expressed sympathy for victims and promised federal aid, Trump again criticized forest management in the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, which was taped on Friday.\u201cMaybe it contributes a little bit,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from Fox News host Chris Wallace about the role climate change may have played in intensifying California\u2019s regular wildfires. \u201cThe big problem is management.\u201dAn unnamed governor, he told Wallace, had explained to him that in properly tended forests that are \u201ccleaned out,\u201d fires can be extinguished \u201cright away.\u201d\u201cAnd then we leave areas un-maintained, he said \u2018we\u2019ll lose 100,000 acres before you even know it,\u201d\u2019 Trump said.Local officials in California say Trump\u2019s statements have been demoralizing to emergency workers risking their lives to fight the fires. His remarks are also misleading. The federal government, not the state, owns 57 percent of California\u2019s forests, according to data from the University of California.Trump proposed cutting the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s funding for the national forest system by 19 percent in his latest budget request. Some programs designed to reduce wildfire risk, including restoring forest landscapes, would be eliminated altogether.Officials are looking at the possible role of electrical equipment owned by PG&E Corp. and Edison International in starting the fires. PG&E shares lost almost two-thirds of their value in the week after the Camp Fire erupted, weighed down by the prospect of billions in potential liabilities.The company rebounded Friday after state officials indicated that they were reluctant to let the company go bankrupt, though there\u2019s been no official action yet.Under state law, utilities can be held liable if their equipment triggered a fire, even if they were in compliance with safety policies. PG&E still faces about $17 billion in potential liabilities for fires last year, and Citigroup Inc. estimated the potential for this year\u2019s blazes at about $15 billion. Within the White House, there\u2019s concern about the impact of the fires on the companies and energy markets.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Friday that the Hill Fire, the smaller of two major blazes in Southern California, was fully contained, while the Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties was 69 percent contained after torching 98,000 acres."}
