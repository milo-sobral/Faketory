{"id": "Hillary Clinton May Run For President in 2020, Says Former Advisor", "paragraph": "Hillary Clinton may run against Donald Trump in the 2020 election after all, a former advisor says. Clinton, who has twice unsuccessfully run for president, previously stated she will not run again. However, in an Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday, longtime Clinton advisor Mark Penn suggested that Clinton is planning a \u201cHillary 4.0\u201d campaign.In the op-ed, Penn said that he thought Clinton, who recently hit the campaign trail for Illinois gubernatorial Candidate J.B. Pritzker, would reinvent herself for the 2020 election, and \u201cwill come full circle\u2014back to the universal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand of 1994.\u201d He says that Clinton won\u2019t let her past defeats stand in her way of running again.According to Penn, Clinton will \u201ccome out swinging,\u201d going on to say that \u201cMrs. Clinton will take down rising Democratic stars like bowling pins. Mike Bloomberg will support her rather than run, and Joe Biden will never be able to take her on.\u201dWhile Clinton has been quite vocal about not running again since her defeat to Trump in 2016, Penn says that \u201cMrs. Clinton knows both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama declared they weren\u2019t running, until they ran,\u201d and that we might even see Hillary 4.0 announce her candidacy after the Iowa caucus. Given her past defeats, this new version of Clinton will be better prepared to win voters in areas where she has previously been defeated.Democrats aren\u2019t the only ones who may be excited about a potential third run from Clinton. On Sunday, Trump aide Kellyanne Conway retweeted a story suggesting Clinton might run again with the commentary \u201cDear God, please, yes.\u201dDear God, please, yes. https://t.co/bmfWokusJj\u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 12, 2018"}
