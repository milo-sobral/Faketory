Suspicious packages were also sent to CNN\u2019s New York offices and to a restaurant owned by actor Robert De Niro.Here are the latest developments, updated throughout the day:New York City police removed a suspected mail bomb Thursday from a Tribeca restaurant owned by actor Robert De Niro, who has been a frequent critic of President Donald Trump.New York City police received a call shortly after 4 a.m. Thursday reporting a suspicious package and responded to the Tribeca Grill restaurant owned by De Niro, a New York Police Department official said. The package was removed and was being transported to an NYPD bomb squad facility in the Bronx, the official said.It was addressed to De Niro personally and contained the same type of explosive device found Wednesday in the Time Warner Center, where CNN is located, a person familiar with the incident said.The FBI issued a statement Wednesday describing five of the suspicious devices found this week.\u201cThe packages are similar in appearance\u201d and \u201ccontain potentially destructive devices,\u201d the FBI said, warning that \u201cit is possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations. The FBI advised the public to remain vigilant and not touch, move or handle any suspicious or unknown packages.\u201dDe Niro, the star of \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d \u201cAnalyze This\u201d and many other movies, denounced the president with an obscenity at the Tony Awards in June, prompting Trump, while on his way back from the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, to call the actor \u201ca very low IQ individual.\u201dThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing another suspicious package in a Delaware postal facility. CBS reported that package was addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden.The FBI said in a statement Thursday that it, along with state and local police and postal inspectors, responded to a facility in Delaware to \u201cconduct law enforcement activity\u201d but declined to specify the nature of the investigation.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that Trump needed to take responsibility for the state of political discourse.\u201cLook, there\u2019s a big difference between comments made and actions taken,\u201d she told reporters at the White House. \u201cThe president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone, no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up a Republican baseball field practice last year.\u201dShe was referring to the shooting of GOP Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana on June 14, 2017.Former CIA Director John Brennan, the target of the package sent to CNN, tweeted that Trump should \u201cstop blaming others. Look in the mirror.\u201d\u201cYour inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies, & encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful,\u201d Brenann added. \u201cClean up your act\u2026.try to act Presidential.\u201dHe was responding to a Trump tweet that blamed the media for inflaming political divisions.John O. Brennan @JohnBrennan Stop blaming others. Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies, & encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful. Clean up your act\u2026.try to act Presidential. The American people deserve much better. BTW, your critics will not be intimidated into silence. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST! http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/statuses/1055418269270716418The FBI said that additional devices may have been sent to other locations and warned the public not to touch or handle any suspicious packages.A statement from the FBI said that five packages had been discovered so far, including one addressed to former Attorney General Eric Holder. That package didn\u2019t reach its intended destination, but was rerouted to a return address in Florida. Another was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN.According to the FBI, all five package bore the same return address: an office of Florida Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thee devices, which were sent to the FBI office in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis, were mailed in manila envelopes with bubble wrap interior. They each had computer-printed address labels and six stamps.\u201cWe ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \u201cDo not hesitate to call; no piece of information is too small to help us in this investigation.\u201dCNN President Jeff Zucker said President Donald Trump should take his words more seriously when it comes to the news media.\u201cThere is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,\u201d Zucker said in a statement issued soon after CNN was allowed back into its New York bureau following a bomb scare. \u201cThe president, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand that words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\u201dEarlier, Trump condemned the attempted attacks without mentioning any of the targets by name.CNN reopened its New York bureau after a suspected explosive device was removed and authorities tested white powder that was sent with the package.\u201cThe NYPD has concluded its security sweep and it is now safe to return to the building,\u201d CNN president Jeff Zucker said in a message to staffers. \u201cI so appreciate your patience, as I know what a long day this has been for all of you.\u201dPresident Donald Trump said the \u201cfull weight of our government\u201d is being deployed as part of a \u2018major federal investigation\u2019 into the suspected explosive devices sent to former and current government officials as he condemned the attempted attacks.\u201cWe\u2019re extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said at the White House. \u201cWe have to unify. We have to come together.\u201dFirst lady Melania Trump also condemned the attempted attacks on Obama and Clinton. \u201cWe cannot tolerate those cowardly attacks,\u201d she said.The Capitol Police\u2019s bomb squad was sent Wednesday morning to the congressional mail sorting facility in Maryland after a suspicious package was reported by staff there, according to a House official who asked not to be identified.The package, which was addressed to Democratic Representative Maxine Waters of California, appeared to be a explosive device, but technicians are continuing to examine it, the official said. While it was discovered Wednesday, investigators were still determining when it arrived.House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving was preparing a statement and a memo to be sent out to all House member offices concerning security.Investigators were examining the device and its contents, assembled in an effort to look like a explosive mechanism, but which may not have ever actually worked or gone off. One official said it appeared to be amateurish.The suspected explosive devices sent to Clinton, Obama and CNN appear to be \u201csimilar\u201d and may have originated from the same source, John Miller, the deputy New York City policy commissioner for counterterrorism, told reporters.\u201cIt appears that an individual or individuals sent out multiple similar packages,\u201d Miller said, adding the devices appeared to be pipe bombs in packages that also contained white powder that has yet to be identified.Miller said New York City police officers happened to be in the CNN building instructing employees on how to identify potential explosive devices when the package was discovered in the mailroom.He said that the New York Police Department has sent information to 20,000 private \u201csecurity partners\u201d in office and apartment buildings, with tips on how to identify and handle suspicious packages.Police removed the device from the CNN office and loaded it into a bomb truck. Then they transported it to a detonation range, inspected it, and are now preparing to send it to an FBI laboratory in Washington.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was just informed that a suspicious package had been sent to his office in Manhattan, adding that the device \u201chas been identified and is being handled as we speak.\u201d\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if more devices show up, Cuomo said.New York City Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said police recovered a device that appeared to be a live explosive at the CNN office in the city and an envelope containing white powder.\u201cThis was clearly an act of terror attempting to undermine the free press and leaders of this country through acts of violence,\u201d New York Mayor Bill De Blasio told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen worse. And we will not be intimidated.\u201dHe added there were no other specific or credible threats in New York City at this time.Hillary Clinton, who was the target of one of the suspected explosives, told an audience in Florida \u201cas a person I\u2019m great, as an American I\u2019m worried.\u201dThe former Democratic presidential candidate who ran against Donald Trump in 2016 said she is \u201cfine\u201d thanks to the Secret Service\u2019s interception of the package but raised concerns about the political atmosphere.\u201cIt is a troubling time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together.\u201dThe suspicious device sent to CNN\u2019s New York office was removed by the New York Police Department\u2019s bomb squad, according to a alert issued by the city\u2019s emergency notification system.Local police say they are investigating a suspicious package found near the Sunrise, Florida, office of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Overhead video of the building on Sawgrass Corporate Parkway showed the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad on the scene.Wasserman Schultz and another intended recipient of a suspicious package, Hillary Clinton, were slated to appear together Wednesday at a Miami-area fundraiser for House candidate Donna Shalala.The entrance to CNN on 58th Street is cordoned off as police officers and dog swarm the area. Television crews, reporters and onlookers gathered at the police barricades to observe the action. Evacuated workers called loved ones on the street, many promising not to go back into the building today.\u201cIt\u2019s scary, but I don\u2019t know what exactly has happened,\u201d said Walter Herrera, a catering contractor with Time Warner who said he was evacuated from the building earlier. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201dHerrera\u2019s colleague, Luis Calderon, initially thought the alarm was a routine fire drill. Calderon, a chef at Restaurant Associates in the Time Warner building, said he walked out without his coat or bag and has no idea when or if he\u2019ll be allowed to re-enter today.President Donald Trump weighed in on the bomb scares for the first time Wednesday afternoon with a three-word tweet endorsing a comment by Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cI agree wholeheartedly!\u201d Trump said, retweeting the statement from Pence.Earlier Pence tweeted, \u201cWe condemn the attempted attacks against fmr Pres Obama, the Clintons, @CNN & others. These cowardly actions are despicable & have no place in this Country.\u201dWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who earlier denounced the attempted attacks on Obama and the Clintons, added a tweet hours later saying, \u201cOur condemnation of these dispicable acts certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants.\u201dCNN is a frequent target of rhetorical attacks by Trump as a purveyor of \u201cfake news.\u201d The network reported that the package was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, who works as a contributor to NBC News.The New York Police Department will brief reporters on the suspected bombs Wednesday afternoon at 12:45 p.m. local time, along with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, according to a tweet from Eric Phillips, de Blasio\u2019s press secretary.The FBI and the U.S. Secret Service are investigating to see whether there are linkages between the devices sent to Obama and the Clintons, as well as the one reported at the CNN bureau in New York.Federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are working with state and local law enforcement to investigate the packages.The New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence, counterterrorism and bomb squad teams are stepping up patrols at locations associated with Obama, Clinton and Soros, as well as media locations in the city and other areas, a police official said speaking on condition of anonymity.New York City also issued an emergency alert to residents on West 58th Street between Columbus and 8th Avenue to shelter in place immediately.Devices addressed to Obama in Washington, D.C., and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, New York, were discovered by the U.S. Secret Service, the agency said Wednesday.\u201cThe packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such,\u201d the Secret Service said in an emailed statement Wednesday. \u201cThe protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them.\u201dThe Secret Service and the FBI launched a broad investigation that included federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said in a tweet that \u201cnothing got to any home.\u201dCNN evacuated its New York bureau in the middle of a broadcast Wednesday morning. Anchors later began broadcasting from a street outside their office.\u201cWe condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.The incidents followed an earlier discovery when police on Monday \u201cproactively detonated\u201d a pipe bomb found at a residence in New York\u2019s suburbs owned by Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor."}
