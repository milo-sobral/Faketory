The U.S. \u201chad better stop the self-destructive act of putting pressure\u201d on the North, the Korean Central News Agency cited director Kwon Jong Gun as saying.The measures hamper South Korea from pursuing cooperation projects with the North, according to the institute in a statement late Friday. That echoes North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s recent comments, saying that \u201cvicious\u201d sanctions stand in the way of promoting the country\u2019s development and lead instead \u201cto change and submission.\u201dThe remarks come a week before a planned meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and North Korean official Kim Yong Chol to discuss details of a potential second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump. Pompeo and Kim will likely be accompanied by special envoy Stephen Biegun and North Korea\u2019s Choe Son Hui, South Korea\u2019s Hankyoreh reported.Hours after the statement was released, satellite imagery seen by 38 North suggested that North Korea is continuing uranium mining and milling operations at one of the country\u2019s largest declared uranium ore concentrate facilities."}
