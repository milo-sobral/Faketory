Analysts estimate that the declines in both stocks anticipate as much as $20 billion in damages for PG&E and $5 billion for Edison.Northern California\u2019s Camp Fire has forced more than 52,000 Californians to evacuate, and injured at least three firefighters since it began on Thursday. At least 29 deaths have also been reported and nearly 230 people are still unaccounted for. In Southern California, the Woolsey Fire has destroyed parts of the city of Malibu, as well as inland communities from Oak Park to Calabasas, and forced the evacuation of a quarter million residents.According to the San Francisco Chronicle, PG&E reported a transmission line outage about 20 minutes before the Camp Fire was reported. The San Jose Mercury News, meanwhile, pointed to radio transmissions from firefighters that indicated the utility\u2019s downed power lines may have sparked the fire. PG&E and fire officials have said the cause of the fire is still being investigated."}
