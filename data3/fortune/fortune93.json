{"id": "Bitcoin Scammers Hijack Twitter Accounts to Run 'Elon Musk' Ads", "paragraph": "The good news is that Twitter has cleaned up some cryptocurrency scams posted on its service. The bad news is the scammers are a step ahead with a new type of rip-off that, like many of the previous ones, uses Tesla CEO Elon Musk as bait.The new scam works like this: Crooks hijack a brand\u2019s Twitter account that has a blue check mark indicating it is authentic. Next, they change the name and the picture on the Twitter account to imitate Musk, and also retweet a series of tweets from Musk\u2019s real account.The hijacked account then becomes a vehicle to promote the scam, in which \u201cElon Musk\u201d claims to have quit Twitter, and asks people to send Bitcoin so they can receive the proceeds of a big giveaway. The latest brand to have its account hijacked is Farah Menswear, a UK clothing outfit:As you can see in the screenshot above, the brand\u2019s Twitter handle still says @farahmenswear, proving it\u2019s a scam. The tweet also says \u201cPromoted,\u201d which indicates the scammers have paid to put it in users\u2019 Twitter feeds.It\u2019s unclear if the scammers are taking over the brands\u2019 Twitter accounts by guessing the passwords, or by some other means. Farah Menswear didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment, and nor did publisher Pantheon Books, which had its account hacked last week:Umm\u2026 Did Pantheon Books account get hacked by a Musk-impersonating bitcoin scammer? pic.twitter.com/UNtbrO4Qhs\u2014 Jeff Roberts (@jeffjohnroberts) November 5, 2018In response to a request for comment, a Twitter spokesperson sent a boilerplate statement that included this remark:\u201cWe\u2019ve substantially improved how we tackle cryptocurrency scams on the platform, and in recent weeks, impressions have fallen by a multiple of 10 as we continue to invest in more proactive tools to detect spammy and malicious activity. This is a significant improvement on previous action rates.\u201dDespite the progress made in curtailing the crypto scams, some remain frustrated. An employee at a prominent cryptocurrency company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said dealing with imposters is an ongoing problem.\u201cI think [it\u2019s improved] a bit but we\u2019re still spending a lot time on whack a mole reporting fakes and scams to Twitter,\u201d said the employee, who added the company had to deal with \u201ca gazillion\u201d fake accounts impersonating a new executive.The employee also expressed frustration that Twitter bans mainstream cryptocurrency companies from advertising on its platform even as scams continue to run rampant.Meanwhile, a prominent tech investor, Jason Calacanis, suggested a way for Twitter to halt the phony Elon Musks in the first place:here is a simple idea that doesn't require any AI @TwitterSupport: don't allow anyone to name their account Elon Musk AND (tweet the word bitcoin/ethernet/giveaway OR post a link to a page with the word bitcoin) without someone from @Twitter Support seeing it first. Welcome!\u2014 jason \ud83e\udd84 \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 \u2764\ufe0f (@Jason) November 12, 2018Calacanis\u2019s idea to reduce scams by requiring pre-approval from Twitter would not have to be limited to Musk. Scammers also regularly appropriate the image of other high profile crypto figures, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The company could make a further dent in scams by vetting anyone who wanted to use their names in a Twitter bio.For now, however, it appears cryptocurrency scams will continue to plague Twitter."}
