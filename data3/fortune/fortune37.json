If approved, the affected account holders will be emailed a notice. Alerts will also be published in People and National Geographic, the Associated Press reports.Claims to a portion of the $50 million can be made by account holders who suffered a loss (such as identity theft or delayed tax refunds) as a result of the data breach. Those with eligible claims will be compensated for time spent handling these losses at a rate of $25 per hour, up to $375 with documentation.Premium Yahoo account holders will also be eligible for a 25% refund, and all account holders affected will receive free credit-monitoring services through AllClear for two years. Yahoo will also have to pay $35 million in lawyer fees, TechCrunch reports.Settlement costs will be split between Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns Yahoo, and Altaba, the unpurchased portion of Yahoo that was renamed following the sale."}
