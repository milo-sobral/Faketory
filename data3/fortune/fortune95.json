{"id": "Adtalem CEO: You Can Get the Right Skills for the Job, Even 'When Life Gets in the Way'", "paragraph": "There are a lot of talented workers out there, but they don\u2019t always have the right skills for the job. That reality is restraining growth in many industries even as competition grows fiercer as companies race ahead to compete during one of the longest U.S. economic expansions on record. Educators hope to seize the opportunity by developing graduates that better fit in-demand jobs.For Adtalem, the 45-year-old for-profit education company, the best strategy starts by asking employers what they need and showing them the diversity of the workforce that\u2019s already out there, says CEO Lisa Wardell.One industry facing a critical skills shortage is healthcare\u2014especially in urban and rural areas. Wardell says Adtalem owns educational institutions that \u201cproduce doctors who want to serve in those communities.\u201d The outcome? \u201cGraduates actually remain in areas that don\u2019t have enough physicians,\u201d she says.Skilling (or reskilling) the workforce is an important duty for societal progress\u2014especially at a time when a substantial number of people remain idle in the workforce. That\u2019s why students in Adtalem classrooms are often \u201cadult learners with families, working while studying\u2014it\u2019s when life gets in the way,\u201d Wardell says.Watch the video above for more from Fortune\u2019s interview with Wardell."}
