Another way of looking at it: The hundreds of companies indexed on the S&P 500 have dropped at least $1.7 trillion in aggregate market value to about $23 trillion since the market\u2019s high in September, based on data from S&P Capital IQ.The selloff was triggered in late September by the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates, but concerns about the global economy deepened the trend.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an interesting results as a part of earnings season,\u201d said Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cCompanies that have started reporting show that headline numbers are good, but you are seeing companies that are tied to global trade are saying they might struggle in the fourth quarter or next year.\u201dFor instance, construction machinery giant Caterpillar fell 5.6% Wednesday after saying a day earlier that manufacturing costs had risen due to tariffs imposed during the Trump administration.The Fed Beige Book, a survey of the country\u2019s businesses, also revealed growing worries about how tariffs may increase the cost of their materials on Wednesday.Across the pond, Euro zone nations also appear to have felt the fallout from the trade war between China and the U.S. The economy of the Eurozone grew at its slowest rate in over two years in September, based on data from IHS Wednesday.\u201cThe slowdown is being led by a drop in exports, linked in turn by many survey respondents to trade wars and tariffs, which appears to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said in a report.Only now, the U.S. economy appears to be chugging along, says Draho, with the Fed Beige Book revealing \u201cmodest to moderate\u201d economic growth.It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by RBC CEO David McKay in a recent Fortune interview.\u201cI can\u2019t see it,\u201d he said of a potential recession in the near future. \u201c[But] I worry we\u2019ll talk ourselves into a recession. I try not to put a date out there because you might create a problem for yourself.\u201dMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell in to correction territory Wednesday, as defined by a drop of about 10% since its all-time high."}
