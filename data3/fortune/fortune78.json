And that positions Live Nation \u201cto benefit from a long runway for growth,\u201d she said.And while the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s interest in concert ticket prices creates some minimal concerns, the Beverly Hills, California-based company has actually been on a tear. Live Nation has gained 104 percent since this time in 2015.With the stock ahead almost 30 percent in 2018 alone, that doesn\u2019t look to be slowing down anytime soon."}
