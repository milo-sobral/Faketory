{"id": "Amazon Reportedly in Talks to Put Second Headquarters in North Virginia", "paragraph": "Amazon has held \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d about the possibility of placing its second headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, the Washington Post reported citing people familiar.The newspaper reported the talks included \u201chow quickly the company would move employees there, which buildings it would occupy and how an announcement about the move would be made to the public.\u201dThe discussions were more detailed than those the company has had regarding other locations in Northern Virginia and some other cities nationally. At stake: the online retail giant\u2019s second North American headquarters and 50,000 jobs.Spokesmen for Amazon declined to comment to the newspaper, as did Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol.But an Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s economic development director isn\u2019t happy about the report.In a tweet Saturday morning, Amazon\u2019s Mike Grella addressed \u201cthe genius leaking info,\u201d saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not doing Crystal City, VA any favors. And stop treating the NDA you signed like a used napkin.\u201d Grella didn\u2019t say who he thought leaked the information, nor did he address the story itself.In another tweet about an hour earlier, Grella criticized an earlier story in the Post \u2014 owned by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 for speculating about the possible second headquarters location based on flight patterns of Bezos\u2019 jet.\u201cThe search team has earned his trust and the highest use of his time isn\u2019t looking at vacant buildings and land \u2014 he has a company to run,\u201d Grella wrote."}
