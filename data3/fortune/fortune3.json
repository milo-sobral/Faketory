The form needs to be filled out by midnight PT or 3 a.m. ET on Oct. 24. The form seems to only require users put in the email address associated with the YouTube TV account.The outage forced viewers to miss the opener for the NBA season and the MLB playoffs. It\u2019s not the first time YouTube TV went out, either. Back in July, the service went down during the World Cup, and a similar compensation was offered following the incident.It\u2019s unclear if YouTube Music, which was also affected by the outage, will give its customers a credit."}
