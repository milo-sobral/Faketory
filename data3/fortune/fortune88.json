{"id": "Explaining Amarin's Fishy Stock Slide", "paragraph": "There\u2019s a fishy story rippling through the life sciences today.On Monday, Dublin-based biopharma Amarin stock sank about 7% (and, at some points during the trading day, as much as 15%) following a tug-of-war narrative over its prescription strength fish oil drug Vascepa\u2014and just how much of a benefit the treatment may present in reducing cholesterol and, consequently, fighting cardiovascular disease.Let\u2019s recap. The debate was set off by detailed results published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) meeting in Chicago over the weekend that highlighted some impressive ways Vascepa appeared to protect high cholesterol patients from heart-related illnesses and death. The so-called REDUCE-IT study concluded that patients who took the drug, rather than a placebo, experienced a sharp reduction in risk of having serious (and potentially deadly) cardiovascular events such as the possibility of death, heart attack, or stroke. By about 26% across the categories, in fact.Amarin had telegraphed these results in earlier, partial study releases. \u201cThe Vascepa fish oil capsule reduced the risk of certain serious cardiovascular events (such as stroke and heart attack) for certain heart patients (those who had high levels of triglyceride fats in their blood and high cholesterol levels being held in check by statins) by 25% compared with placebo. That\u2019s an eye-popping figure when it comes to the heart health space,\u201d as I wrote in September.The fish oil drug\u2019s promise helped Amarin\u2019s stock soar about 600% over the past three months despite Monday\u2019s slide (although that percentage is also attributable to the shares\u2019 historically low prices).But some investors and industry observers are raising their eyebrows over the precise nature of the placebo used in the Vascepa trial. Amarin\u2019s placebo used a mineral oil which could theoretically boost trial participants\u2019 \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol levels. That could, in turn, make the fish oil\u2019s performance in reducing cardiovascular risk appear particularly strong (or so the thinking seems to go among the more skeptical).Those concerns, however, may not derail Amarin\u2019s quest to get the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to slap a favorable label on Vascepa (which was approved by the agency six years ago) showing serious heart health benefits. Heck, even the investor fretting eroded over the course of the day. And Amarin\u2019s chief executive is expressing nothing but confidence.\u201cWe are a science-driven company that is focused on helping patients. With these results, we\u2019re in a position to help millions more patients,\u201d said Amarin CEO John Thero in a statement, adding that the company plans on submitting data to the FDA next year.We\u2019ll find out soon enough how that review goes.Subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations."}
