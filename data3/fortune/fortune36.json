{"id": "Mister Rogers Stars in His First TV Commercial\u2014For Google", "paragraph": "The voice of Fred Rogers, better known as the host of children\u2019s show Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, returned to television screens on Tuesday night during the World Series. Rogers, who died in 2003, sang one of his standards, Did You Know, in a commercial for Google\u2019s new Pixel 3 phone, marking the first time the beloved figure\u2019s voice has been used on TV to pitch a product.As children appear on screen in activities like knitting, cooking and paddle boarding, Rogers sings: \u201cYou can ask a lot of questions about the world and your place in it. You can ask about people\u2019s feelings. You can learn the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201dGoogle introduced the Pixel 3 phone line on Oct. 9 in two sizes that feature a camera app fueled by machine learning to improve picture taking. The company is trying to seize market share-or at least some attention-from Apple, which sells far, far more iPhones (by one estimate Apple sold more phones in one week than Google sold all of last year).An agency preparing Google\u2019s ad approached Fred Rogers Productions in Pittsburgh seeking permission to use the song, said Suzanne Masri, director of marketing and communications. Typically, \u201cWe really do not license Fred\u2019s music or image for commercials,\u201d she pointed out.But the group was won over by the theme of Google\u2019s commercial, showing children exploring the world and using a smartphone for learning with family and friends, not in isolation, Masri said. \u201cThe context of the ad and the use of wonder was really a use of media very much in line with how Fred would have used technology\u2014out in the real world, to discover, to explore,\u201d she said.For Rogers\u2019 cameo, Google (googl) paid Fred Rogers Productions a licensing fee, which Masri declined to disclose. Google declined to comment. The company commemorated Rogers\u2019 show with a Google doodle last month.Rogers was not a fan of commercials on television during his lifetime, though he did create a program in the 1960s sponsored by Horne\u2019s Department Store.He started his iconic children\u2019s show in 1967 and hosted all 895 episodes before ending the run in 2001. The show appeared on public television without any advertising interruptions.Rogers died of stomach cancer in 2003 at the age of 74."}
