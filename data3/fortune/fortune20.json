{"id": "Tesla's Stock Soars 15% After Blowout Earnings as Model 3 Deliveries Rise", "paragraph": "Tesla\u2019s stock surged as much as 15% Wednesday, after posting earnings in the third quarter that blew away Wall Street\u2019s profit forecasts as the company began selling the enough of its new Model 3 cars to push the company well into the black.Where the consensus of analysts called for a loss of 3 cents a share, Tesla posted a profit of $2.90 a share. A year ago, Tesla had posted a net loss of $3.70 a share as Tesla spent heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3. Those losses led Tesla bears, including many short sellers, to doubt the company\u2019s ability to run a profitable business.Skeptics of Tesla had doubted CEO Elon Musk\u2019s assurances that Tesla would become not only profitable in the second half of 2018 but also free cash flow positive. Investors look to free cash flow as a measure of a company\u2019s ability to generate cash to finance its core operations rather than raising capital. Tesla\u2019s free cash flow in the quarter was a positive $181 million after being negative for several quarters.The quarter marks only the third time in Tesla\u2019s 15-year history that it has reported a profit and positive cash flow, according to Reuters. Musk had made a bold bet that sales of the Model 3, which offers many luxury features of the Models S and X but at a lower price, would more than offset the ambitious production line needed to manufacture the cars at scale. Musk has described the challenges of that task as \u201cproduction hell.\u201dThroughout the past year or so, Musk has also become increasingly vocal about investors shorting Tesla shares\u2014that is, selling borrowed Tesla shares to buy them back at a profit should Tesla\u2019s stock sink. Along the way, some of Musk\u2019s behavior became erratic enough to worry its investors.When Musk tweeted he had found funding to take Tesla private, the SEC sued Musk for misleading investors. Musk settled with the SEC, but the episode caused Tesla\u2019s stock to fall from $379 a share in early August to $250 this month. Bearish investors had added to their short positions in the week before Tesla earnings, but the stock ended up spiking on the company\u2019s surprisingly strong results.Tesla delivered 56,065 Model 3 vehicles to customers during the quarter and 27,710 Model S and X vehicles. At the same time, Tesla\u2019s capital spending was less than analysts were expecting, at $510 million. Tesla added to investors\u2019 optimism by saying it expects to post another profit and to remain cash flow positive in the current quarter.One longtime skeptic of the company, Andrew Left of Citron Research, reversed his position on Tesla this week, saying in a blog post that \u201cthe Model 3 is a proven hit and many of the TSLA warning signs have proven not to be significant.\u201d Left had shorted Tesla shares in recent years but now believes in the company. \u201cPlain and simple\u2014Tesla is destroying the competition,\u201d he said.In an interview on Bloomberg TV, Left explained that his doubts about Tesla were driven in part by Musk\u2019s controversial actions, but when he studied the underlying numbers, he decided the company was actually in good shape. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Elon Musk has made such a sideshow of himself that people\u2014including myself\u2014started forgetting about the underlying business,\u201d Left said, noting Tesla\u2019s numbers showed in fact that it was \u201ccompletely smoking the competition.\u201d"}
