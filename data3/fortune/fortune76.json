{"id": "Two to Tango: Parsing Trump's Argentine Dinner Date with Xi", "paragraph": "Global stock markets were whipsawed this week by conflicting signals from the White House about President Trump\u2019s offer to host a dinner with Chinese president Xi Jinping after this month\u2019s Group of 20 summit in Argentina. Trump inspired a burst of euphoria among investors Thursday morning by tweeting that he had just concluded a \u201clong and very good conversation\u201d with Xi and that discussions with China were \u201cmoving along nicely.\u201d Later in the day, his economic adviser Larry Kudlow stoked optimism by telling reporters there may be a \u201cthaw\u201d between the US and China on trade.There was a moment of uncertainty Thursday afternoon, when US attorney Jeff Sessions unveiled the latest of a series of charges of Chinese theft of US trade secrets. But at a rally in Missouri that night, Trump remained upbeat. The Chinese \u201cwant to make a deal,\u201d he declared, adding: \u201cLots of great things are going to happen over the next short period of time. It\u2019s going to work out good.\u201dWord of the G20 meeting, combined with Trump\u2019s upbeat comments and a Bloomberg report late Thursday suggesting White House officials already are drafting terms of a US-China trade deal, spurred a sharp surge in Asian stock markets Friday (Thursday night US time), which spilled over into a 200 point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial average Friday morning. Trump took to the White House lawn and seemed to bless the rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very good discussions with China,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe are much closer to doing something.\u201dAnd then, on Friday afternoon, the White House spin cycle lurched into reverse. Kudlow appeared on CNBC and pooh-poohed talk of a trade breakthrough. \u201cThere\u2019s no massive movement to deal with China,\u201d he said. The administration is doing \u201cnormal, routine preparation\u201d for Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi. The Dow surrendered the morning\u2019s gains and ended the day down more than 100 points.What\u2019s really going on? Cynics say Trump is trying to talk up the stock market ahead of this week\u2019s midterm elections. Vanity Fair suggests that Kudlow, wittingly or not, had \u201cblown up\u201d Trump\u2019s midterm Hail Mary. True or not, the outcome of those elections will alter the power dynamics when Trump and Xi meet next. If, as many analysts predict, the election produces a \u201cblue wave\u201d that overturns the Republicans\u2019 House majority, will Trump decide its time for a China truce? Or will he simply double down?More China news below.ceo_attribution author=\u201dClay Chandler\u201d email=\u201dclay.chandler@timeinc.com\u201d twitter=\u201dclaychandler\u201d]The ol\u2019 one-\u2026 On Tuesday the U.S. slapped sanctions on Fujian Jinhua, a Chinese chip maker, alleging that the company posed a threat to U.S. security.
