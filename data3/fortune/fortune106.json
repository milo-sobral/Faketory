{"id": "Canada Goose Is Turning the Dressing Room Into a Freezer", "paragraph": "Canada Goose Holdings Inc. wants its customers to know what real cold feels like\u2014from the comfort of a $1,000 parka.The company is adding frigid rooms to some of its stores where shoppers can test the luxury coats in temperatures as low as -25 degrees Celsius (-13 Fahrenheit). A Montreal location, which opened Friday, is the fifth to include the fancy freezer, and Beijing will join later this year as the company rolls out its China expansion plan.\u201cPeople tell me all the time trying on a Canada Goose jacket was the first time that they ever truly felt warm in cold climates,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss told analysts this week. \u201cWith our cold rooms, we are creating that moment even before they purchase.\u201dThe rooms have become selfie magnets, some with sculpted ice blocks lining a glass window. They are part of Canada Goose\u2019s plan to increasingly sell directly to consumers after decades of relying on wholesalers. Putting its coats to the test in a subtropical place like Hong Kong also helps the brand tout its authenticity in new markets while it adds lighter products to its collection.\u201cThe ability to experience the feel of a coat at a given temperature is a smart concept that goes beyond buzz,\u201d says Greg Portell, lead partner at consultant A.T. Kearney\u2019s retail practice. \u201cThey are removing a key barrier to consumer purchase.\u201dWhile Canada Goose\u2019s small retail network\u201311 stores to date\u2014and its high prices make the concept workable, it would be a challenge to scale up, Portell says. The company, which used cold chambers at trade shows in the past, first tried one in a store in Tokyo last year. Short Hills, New Jersey, Hong Kong and Boston followed.\u201cPeople in Tokyo, where it rarely goes below into the minuses, went \u2018oh wow, this actually works!\u201d\u2019 says Chief Marketing Officer Penny Brook.For most of its 61-year history, the Toronto-based company sold practical winter gear for use in the Far North. Now it offers dozens of jackets split into five categories that match a temperature range. Its warmest model, a 247-piece parka designed for Arctic expeditions, costs $1,550 in the U.S. and is almost sold out online.\u201cA smart concept that goes beyond buzz.\u201dCustomers are escorted to the room by staff who helped them pick out the gear. They can stay as long as they want and get an extra kick from a wind-chill button. On a freezing November morning in Montreal the experience wasn\u2019t so different from walking outside, but tourists and die-hard fans who buy coats in the summer will probably enjoy the cold room more on a sweltering August day.It was certainly a selling point for Rachel Zhang and her boyfriend Guo, who snapped pictures of themselves in Montreal\u2019s cold room, which was a frosty -15 Celsius. They both bought jackets, her second and his fourth by the brand.\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d said Zhang, a Montreal resident. \u201cIt also reassured me.\u201dThe cold room adds to retailers\u2019 ongoing efforts to offer shoppers a memorable experience in brick-and-mortar stores\u2013from Lululemon Athletica Inc.\u2019s running club and yoga classes to Vitamin Shoppe Inc.\u2019s beverage bars\u2013says Deborah Weinswig, chief executive officer of retail think tank Coresight Research.Canada Goose\u2019s Brook sees it as an opportunity to strengthen the brand\u2019s relationship with customers.\u201cWe really want to show them what we\u2019re made of,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the perfect way of doing it.\u201d"}
