Trump wrote, \u201cJust watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper. He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!\u201dJust watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper.
