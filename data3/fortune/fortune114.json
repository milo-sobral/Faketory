{"id": "Trade War Will Produce 'No Winners,' China's Xi Tells APEC", "paragraph": "China\u2019s President Xi Jinping said a trade war will produce \u201cno winners\u201d and called for nations to uphold a rules-based order led by the World Trade Organization.Implementing tariffs and cutting economic ties \u201cis a short-sighted approach and it is doomed to failure,\u201d Xi said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit on Saturday in Papua New Guinea. Protectionism and unilateralism were overshadowing global growth, and a policy of erecting economic barriers was doomed to fail, Xi said.The growing U.S.-China trade dispute is looming large at the APEC summit this weekend in Papua New Guinea, where U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday said the Trump administration won\u2019t change course of tariffs until China \u201cchanges its ways.\u201d The U.S. has so far imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. In retaliation, China has slapped tariffs on $110 billion in imports from the U.S. and effectively shut off its purchase of key American agricultural exports including soybeans.\u201cDisagreements should be resolved through consultation,\u201d Xi told the forum on a cruise ship anchored off Port Moresby. \u201cAttempts to form exclusive blocs or impose one\u2019s will on others should be rejected. History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners.\u201dPence began his speech by saying the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific had never been stronger. He criticized infrastructure funding that saddled developing nations with debt and took a swipe at China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\u201cThe United States offers a better option. We don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201dXi reminded the audience that Papua New Guinea, a Pacific nation that has been the recipient of large amounts of aid and loans from Beijing, played an important role during World War II.\u201cMankind has once again reached a crossroads. Which direction should we choose?,\u201d Xi said. \u201cCooperation or confrontation? The interests of all countries and indeed the future of mankind hinge on the choice we make.\u201d"}
