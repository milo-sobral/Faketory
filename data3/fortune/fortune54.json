{"id": "ThredUP Launches Remade, a Clothing Line Designed for Resale", "paragraph": "The largest online thrift store, thredUP, launched its own clothing line Tuesday, with resale in mind. The clothes come with an incentive for customers to sell the items that they no longer want back to the company, leading to fewer clothes ending up in landfills.Since its founding almost 10 years ago, thredUP has amassed a wealth of data about what styles sell quickly online. When designing its new line, called Remade, thredUP\u2019s team used this information to decide which cuts, colors, and styles should be included.\u201cWe leveraged all the data that we have at thredUP around average sell-through, and then used that to pick the right items to produce,\u201d explained James Reinhart, thredUP\u2019s co-founder and CEO.According to this data, a dark-colored wrap dress with small flowers sells better than a lighter design with larger flowers. \u201cWe could have picked one or the other,\u201d says Reinhart. \u201cWe let the data tell us which one to pick.\u201dThe final collection has eight items\u2014t-shirts, a cardigan, wrap dresses, and blouses of varying styles\u2014in sizes XS to 3X, priced from $20 to $50. Each item also comes with a buyback guarantee: if you buy from Remade and sell the item back to thredUP, you\u2019re promised a 40% return of the original value.To help with resales, thredUP said that its clothing is designed to be more durable than what other affordable brands produce. According to to a thredUP post on Medium, Remade\u2019s clothes are made from \u201cconsciously sourced high-grade materials, bonded with quality stitching and seams that ensure a longer lifespan across multiple owners.\u201d\u201cHow quickly thredUP resells the clothes is part of the Remade experiment,\u201d says Reinhart. He says thredUP expects that each item will ultimately be owned by three to four customers, but the team doesn\u2019t know whether each one will wear the item for a month before returning it, or wear it for a year.Regardless of the time frame, the selling history of each Remade item will be traceable through a QR code printed on the tag.\u201cIt makes it very easy for that customer to learn more about that item, but also in a resale environment it makes it very easy which item that is,\u201d says Reinhart.With information about the collection, year, and ownership, thredUP can more easily process the item, price it accordingly, and get it back online for resale. Ideally, consumers won\u2019t cut off the tag (or will save it if they want the 40% return). But Reinhart knows this is part of the learning process.\u201cMaybe we actually need to print it on the fabric somewhere, so that it\u2019s tagless. That\u2019s the nice part about launching experiments and seeing how consumers adopt them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201dAll Remade items have been produced in factories that passed social responsibility and compliance testing, according to a thredUP post on Medium. The factories also participate in projects to benefit women\u2019s health and education, and the mills are water safety and efficiency compliant.While the ultimate goal is to make Remade items from recycled materials, further reducing the clothing\u2019s environmental impact, Reinhart said this isn\u2019t easy to achieve.\u201cFirst we want to prove that the value-proposition of buying something with resale in mind works,\u201d he told Fortune, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how do you make resale and reuse accessible, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily always go hand-in-hand with recycled materials.\u201dBut, he says, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d"}
