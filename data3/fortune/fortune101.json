{"id": "Cyber Saturday\u2014BlackBerry's Biggest Buy, Facebook's Crisis Mismanagement, Assange's Secret Charges", "paragraph": "BlackBerry is making its biggest acquisition ever.The once-dominant smartphone maker known for producing mobile devices so addictive people used to call them \u201ccrackberries\u201d said Friday it is plunking down $1.4 billion in cash to buy Cylance, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in machine learning-enabled threat detection. Pending regulatory approval, expected by February, the purchase will deplete more than half of BlackBerry\u2019s cash pile.The acquisition reflects BlackBerry CEO John Chen\u2019s multiyear imperative: a shift from selling phones to enterprise software and services. He first laid out the strategy shortly after becoming CEO in 2013. (BlackBerry stopped making its own phones two years ago, though it continues to license its brand.)Chen said in a statement that the addition of Cylance would \u201cimmediately complement our entire portfolio.\u201d In particular, he said the business, set to run as an independent unit, would bolster BlackBerry\u2019s \u201cunified endpoint management\u201d software, which helps businesses manage devices and applications, and QNX, an operating system used inside power plants and cars.With Cylance, BlackBerry is seeking a greater slice of businesses\u2019 information security spend, which market researcher Gartner estimates will exceed $114 billion this year. That BlackBerry is putting up triple the amount it paid for ex-rival Good Technology, its last biggest acquisition, made in 2015, demonstrates that it is fully committed to the pursuit of this new business model\u2014best exemplified by BlackBerry Spark, a platform it is pitching as the secure, connective tissue for all sorts of connected devices.If the deal goes through, BlackBerry\u2019s purchase of Cylance will be the latest in a recent series of cybersecurity acquisitions including Cisco buying Duo for $2.4 billion and private equity firm Thoma Bravo taking over Veracode for $950 million. (Rumors are swirling, meanwhile, that Facebook, beset by propagandists, trolls, and privacy breaches, has been poking around for a major cybersecurity acquisition as well.)Even as Cylance exits the \u201cunicorn\u201d club, a collection of startups privately valued at $1 billion or more, another company has stepped up to take its place. Earlier this week I broke the news that Netskope, a cloud security startup, had earned its unicorn horn after raising a new round of funding worth $170 million. But these mythical beasts are fleeing the stable quicker than their stock can be replenished.Market consolidation will continue. Businesses are going to be spending more money on cybersecurity in the years to come, but it\u2019s going to be with fewer vendors.BlackBerry sure hopes it will be one of them.Have a great weekend.Robert Hackett@rhhackettrobert.hackett@fortune.comWelcome to the Cyber Saturday edition of Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily tech newsletter.

The paper claims that Facebook executives\u2014particularly\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer\u2014sought to hinder investigations of Russian troll accounts and viral misinformation while minimizing disclosures to the public.\u00a0Sandberg denied the allegations as \u201cjust plain wrong.\u201d (The official party line is\u00a0here.)WikiLeaks\u2026leaks.\u00a0U.S. prosecutors seem to have\u00a0inadvertently revealed\u00a0that they have, under seal, charged Julian Assange, founder of secret-leaking website WikiLeaks. The telltale ink: Assistant U.S. Attorney Kellen S. Dwyer wrote that \u201cAssange has been charged\u201d in an unrelated court filing in the Eastern District of Virginia that was recently unsealed. (A spokesperson said the filing was \u201cmade in error.\u201d) The exact nature of the charges remains unknown, but experts expect they might involve the Espionage Act, which outlaws the disclosure of information related to national defense.Assassin\u2019s creed. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded with high confidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, or \u201cMBS,\u201d\u00a0ordered last month\u2019s execution of Jamal Kashoggi, a Washington Post contributor. The Saudi government, whose statements about the incident have shifted for weeks, has continued to deny MBS\u2019s involvement. The country\u2019s public prosecutor has called for five people accused of involvement to receive the death penalty.Internet entomology. A since-fixed\u00a0Instagram bug related to its \u201cdownload your data\u201d feature accidentally compromised people\u2019s passwords. A database containing tens of millions of text message-based two-factor authentication codes was accidentally exposed to the public. And researchers discovered seven new variations of the Meltdown and Spectre computer chip attacks, which affect AMD, ARM and Intel.\u201cCyber is, to a large extent, where it\u2019s at nowadays.\u201dShare today\u2019s Cyber Saturday with a friend:http://fortune.com/newsletter/cybersaturday/Looking for previous Data Sheets? Click herePractice makes perfect.\u00a0The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a hawkish view on national security, held tabletop exercises that imagined how the U.S. might respond to a digital assault from China. Participants were asked to consider what the government and private sector might ask each other amid such an onslaught, the result of an invented geopolitical crisis sparked by some \u201cconfrontation\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, as reports CyberScoop, an information security news outlet.The U.S. financial and energy sectors are no strangers to foreign government hackers, from Iranian denial-of-service attacks on American banks to Russian reconnaissance of industrial control systems. Less-familiar territory, however, is how companies would work with the U.S. government to respond to a cross-sector cyberattack during a geopolitical crisis.About 20 private-sector executives and former government officials gathered last month in Washington, D.C., to take a stab at that question.Amazon Announces a Security Change That May Help Companies Using AWS to Avoid Data Breaches by Glenn FleishmanWealthy Home Buyers Can No Longer Conceal Their Identities In These Cities by Renae ReintsRepublicans and Democrats Make a Rare Show of Unity\u2014Against Robocalls by Laura StamplerExclusive: Dragos Raises $37 Million to Secure Industrial Systems by Robert HackettChina or Russia Could Defeat \u201cEroded\u201d U.S. Military, Congress Warns in Alarming Bipartisan Report by David MeyerBitcoin Scammers Hijack Twitter Accounts to Run \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 Ads by Jeff John Roberts\u2018Distinctly Uncomfortable:\u2019 U.K. Companies\u2019 Plans to Microchip Employees Face Fierce Pushback by Hallie DetrickGive this guy a hand.\u00a0The first line to this Vice Motherboard story instantly hooks: \u201cIt was just before midnight when I made the impulsive decision that would transform me into the world\u2019s most useless cyborg.\u201d\u00a0Reporter Daniel Oberhaus tells the tale of a chip implant he had injected into his hand which would take a year to unlock. \u201cIf I had a single piece of advice for anyone thinking about getting an NFC chip implant it would be to do it sober,\u201d Oberhaus cautions.
