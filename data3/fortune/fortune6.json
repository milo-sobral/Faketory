Both HealthCare.gov and the Marketplace Call Center remain in operation.\u201cI want to make clear to the public that HealthCare.gov and the Marketplace Call Center are still available, and open enrollment will not be negatively impacted,\u201d CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to identify the individuals potentially impacted as quickly as possible so that we can notify them and provide resources such as credit protection.\u201dAccess to the Direct Enrollment pathway will be restored to agents and brokers within the week, CMS said.\u00a0"}
