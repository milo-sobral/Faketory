{"id": "Apple's Jony Ive Designed a $150,000 Ring Made Entirely Out of Diamonds", "paragraph": "Jony Ive is known for his work designing computers and iPhones. However, Apple\u2019s Chief Design Officer recently worked with industrial design Marc Newson on something a little different: a diamond ring.Unlike most diamond rings that have a metal band made of gold or silver, Ive decided to \u201cthink different\u201d and instead created the entire ring out of diamonds. Rather than being sold in a jewelry store, the one-of-a-kind ring will be sold exclusively at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in December, a (RED) Auction to raise funds to help eliminate HIV/AIDS in eight African countries.The ring will be made to fit the buyer. Just as the design is unique, the ring\u2019s construction will also be a bit unusual.\u201cThe diamond block will be faceted with several thousand facets, some of which are as small as several hundred micrometers. The interior ring will be cylindrically cut out for the desired smoothness using a micrometer thick water jet inside which a laser beam is cast,\u201d reads the ring\u2019s description on Sotheby\u2019s auction site. \u201cThe finished ring will have between 2000\u20133000 facets which has never been seen before on a single piece.\u201dThe auction will be held on Dec. 5th in Miami. The ring is expected to sell for between $150,000 and $250,000."}
