{"id": "Brainstorm Health: Glaxo HIV Drug, Obamacare Downtime, Same Sex Health Coverage", "paragraph": "The evolution of HIV treatment is one of the most striking stories in the life sciences. What was once a near-certain death sentence is now largely a manageable chronic condition thanks to modern science. Treatment regimens that used to require dozens of pills have now been simplified to once-a-day, three-drug combination therapies.Now, the question facing drug makers is: How do you make HIV treatment even more convenient and effective?To that end, companies like Gilead and GlaxoSmithKline (the two market leaders in the space) have been attempting to simplify therapy regimens. And, on Tuesday, GSK-run Viiv Healthcare said that an experimental two-drug combination scored its primary goals in a late-stage clinical trial.What makes the Glaxo treatment unique is that, not only does it contain two (rather than three) drugs\u2014it\u2019s a long-acting medicine that requires just a monthly injection. Theoretically, if the trial results hold up, HIV treatment could evolve from a once-daily pill to a once-monthly shot.GSK shares were up about 1% in Tuesday trading.Read on for the day\u2019s news.Obamacare enrollment begins soon\u2014with scheduled downtime.\u00a0The open enrollment season for the Affordable Care Act launches on Thursday.

A brutal review by the agency slams everything from the treatment\u2019s potential safety to the trial design used by Alkermes (not to mention the data collected under the trial). A panel of FDA advisers are slated to meet and discuss the treatment later this week. It should make for an interesting conversation.\u00a0(Xconomy)Access to same sex health coverage is growing.\u00a0A new Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) report finds that employers are (slowly) offering more health coverage to same-sex spouses. While gay marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015, employers are under no legal obligation to offer health benefits to same-sex couples; KFF\u2019s report highlights several interesting trends, including that: \u201cLarge firms (those with 200 or more employees) were more likely to offer coverage to same-sex spouses compared to smaller firms (87% vs 62%). Almost nine in ten (87%) large firms with opposite-sex spousal coverage offered such coverage, 9% did not, and 4% reported they had not encountered this benefits issue.\u201d Read the full report here.\u00a0(KFF)In \u2018Keeping at It,\u2019 Paul Volcker Pulls No Punches,\u00a0by Alan MurrayGE Just Cut Its Dividend to Almost Nothing,\u00a0by David MeyerGoogle Workers Are Planning a Walkout This Week.
