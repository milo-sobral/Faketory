{"id": "Why the U.S.-China Trade Deficit Keeps Growing Despite Trump's Tariffs", "paragraph": "One of the great ironies of the U.S.-China trade war is that, since March, when president Donald Trump began slapping tariffs on Chinese imports, America\u2019s merchandise trade deficit with China has grown bigger, not smaller.As Financial Times\u2019 Gillian Tett points out in this excellent column Friday, America\u2019s September merchandise trade deficit with China jumped 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted $37 billion\u2014a record high. The increase reflected an 8% rise in U.S. imports from China, while U.S. exports to China remained flat. And that wasn\u2019t a monthly blip. In the third quarter, America\u2019s deficit with China soared to $106 billion, up from $93 billion in the same period last year. For the year to September, America\u2019s trade deficit with China has ballooned to $305 billion, up from $276.6 billion last year.What\u2019s going on? Tett ticks through the reasons for the widening gap: the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders and sucking in more Chinese imports as it grows; the cost of tariffs have been offset by a weaker Chinese currency; American companies are stockpiling imports ahead of the threat of even higher tariffs. She also cites the explanation of Soren Skou, chief executive of AP Maersk, one of the world\u2019s largest shipping companies: \u201cChinese companies\u2026find it a lot easier to source substitutes for American products than the US does in replacing Chinese imports.\u201dTett\u2019s column sports a click-bait headline: \u201cChina is winning the trade war with America for now.\u201d But those last two words are a significant hedge. The rising deficit with China is probably a short-term phenomenon, and seems unlikely to persist if Trump follows through with his threat to extend tariffs to all Chinese imports and raise rates from the current 10% to 25% should the two nations fail to reach a deal before the end of the year. Even so, growth in the U.S. deficit so far demonstrates, as Tett notes, \u201chow hard it is to predict the precise consequences of a trade war.\u201dAs for the likelihood of the two nations reaching a trade deal, the odds don\u2019t seem to have improved much over the last few days. China has floated a list of compromises it\u2019s willing to consider ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month when Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping are set to meet for dinner. But Trump has dismissed that list as \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d On Saturday, Xi, speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Papua New Guinea, declared that a trade war would produce \u201cno winners\u201c\u2014but he offered no indication China is willing to make further concessions. US vice president Mike Pence, filling in for Trump at the APEC meeting, gave no quarter. The U.S. \u201cwill not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d he declared. Pence also attacked Xi\u2019s signature \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative and warned Asian nations to shun loans from China that could compromise their sovereignty.More China news below.No clause for concern. Canada and China will continue working towards a free trade deal despite implications of the recent USMCA agreement, according to remarks made by Premier Li Keqiang after meeting with President Trudeau on the side-lines of the ASEAN summit this week. The USMCA requires member states to issue a warning before pursuing free trade deals with any \u2018non-market economy\u2019 \u2013 a clause perceived to have been inserted by the U.S. to prohibit Mexico and Canada from engaging with China. South China Morning PostPolitical bank. China\u2019s central bank has ordered all financial institutions to improve their \u201cpolitical positioning,\u201d to fall in line with President Xi Jinping, and ensure support for the \u201creal economy\u201d. The whipping came as China released weak economic data for October, with new loans dropping nearly 50% from September. Analysts expect there will be new stimulus measures coming. South China Morning PostPig fever. China has been attempting to contain outbreaks of African swine fever for the past three months, claiming that the situation is under control. But this week the government confirmed the disease has spread to over half of the nation\u2019s provinces and has labelled the epidemic \u2018very serious\u2019. The virus doesn\u2019t affect humans but it is fatal to pigs. China accounts for 50% of the world\u2019s pig stock and pork prices have spiked since the first outbreak in August. The UN described the chances of the virus being transmitted to other countries in Asia as \u2018a near certainty\u2019. Asia TimesStocking up. MSCI will add several onshore Chinese funds, including SF Holdings and 360 Security Technology, to its emerging-markets index. The change will take effect at the end of the month. ReutersMonopoly car. China has launched an investigation into the Uber-Didi tie up to see whether the merger breaches antitrust laws. Uber sold its China business to local ride-share leader Didi in 2016, leaving the combined entity control over roughly 90% of the market. Antitrust regulators flagged the deal when it occurred but no legal progress has been made, possibly because there was no legislation to properly define the ride-hailing industry. TechNodeGreat balls of fire. Never mind the artificial moon Chengdu wants to launch to illuminate the night sky, Chinese scientists now claim to have created an \u201cartificial sun\u201d. The scientists created a plasma six times hotter than the sun\u2019s core. The substance burned at 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds. The experiment is a step towards creating the world\u2019s first nuclear fusion reactor. Sixth ToneUser not found. Nearly 10,000 user accounts across various social media platforms have been deleted over the last three weeks as part of a government censorship drive. The Cyberspace Administration summoned reps from Weibo and WeChat for a dressing down, accusing them of failing to manage content. In a statement, the administration said some of the removed accounts had threatened China\u2019s social mores, while others had distorted the \u201chistory of the Communist Party\u201d. South China Morning Post\u00a0Not buying it. Pinduoduo, the Chinese \u201csocial+\u201d ecommerce app that shot from obscurity to a $24 billion IPO in just three years has been accused of cooking its books by short seller Blue Orca. The activist fund alleges PDD\u2019s losses last year were 65% greater than it claimed. PDD has dismissed the allegation. Elsewhere Qutoutiao, another Chinese upstart that rushed to market in September, reported losses in Q3 8886% larger than in the same period last year. The Chinese model of building presence before profit is becoming more and more costly.

President Trump skipped the ASEAN summit this week, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place and seemingly contradicting the White House\u2019s assurance that Asia remains of strategic significance to the U.S. While at the summit, Pence didn\u2019t shy from controversy. He lambasted China\u2019s militarization of disputed island territories and remarked, \u201cThe South China Sea doesn\u2019t belong to any one nation\u201d \u2013 a claim the eponymous China strongly disagrees with. CNBCPacific assurances. Xi Jinping arrived in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Friday to fanfare worthy of a returning national hero. He is the first Chinese president to make a state visit to the nation, the poorest member of APEC, where Chinese funding is having a huge impact. Australia has raised concerns about growing Chinese influence in the region and recently launched a Pacific infrastructure fund as an alternative to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The GuardianKindred spirits. Fifteen Western ambassadors in China, under leadership from Canada, signed a letter demanding a meeting with Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo as evidence of government oppression in the region mounts. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused the diplomats of \u2018interfering\u2019 in domestic affairs. Meanwhile, China offered support to Myanmar as global criticism over the Rohingya crisis continues. Premier Li Keqiang told Aung Sang Suu Kyi his government supports Myanmar\u2019s \u201cefforts in maintaining its domestic stability\u201d.
