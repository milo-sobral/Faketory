{"id": "Trump Claims China Election Meddling. Cyber Firms Don't See It", "paragraph": "President Donald Trump has said China is interfering with the November midterm elections, but the findings of top cybersecurity firms are casting doubt on his claims.\u201cWe haven\u2019t observed any evidence of Chinese targeting the midterms or anything that would be relevant to upcoming elections,\u201d said Luke McNamara, a principal intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc., which works with some state and local authorities to monitor election threats.Jon DiMaggio, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Symantec Corp., which studies threats to campaigns, candidates, states, and on social media, said he\u2019s observed \u201cno digital trail of breadcrumbs that is leading back to China.\u201dIdentifying nation-state hackers is complex, and the analysts agree that there may be some they haven\u2019t detected. But the firms\u2019 common finding of no evidence raises fresh questions about Trump\u2019s assertions.Trump\u2019s claim \u2014 that China is pursuing a campaign to interfere in the election and damage his administration \u2014 is putting extra strain on an already fraught relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade conflict, and earlier this month, U.S. and Chinese warships nearly collided in the South China Sea, where both nations are seeking to assert their regional dominance.The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Office of Director of National Intelligence warned Friday that nations including China were engaged in \u201congoing campaigns\u201d to \u201cundermine confidence\u201d and influence policy and opinion in the U.S.The administration hasn\u2019t provided evidence to back up the allegations.Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer at Crowdstrike Inc., which works with states and municipalities to look for intrusions, said of China, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen any activity in cyberspace from them that\u2019s election related, but there could be something outside of it,\u201d such as conventional election-related propaganda.Chris Krebs, a DHS under secretary, told reporters Friday that the threat involved \u201cmedia manipulation.\u201d Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have both cited a paid advertising supplement the Chinese government placed in the Des Moines Register, Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper, criticizing the administration\u2019s trade policies.The accusations have been building since last month, when Trump told the United Nations Security Council that \u201cChina has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration.\u201dPence followed up with a speech this month, saying: \u201cThere can be no doubt: China is meddling in America\u2019s democracy.\u201d Pence characterized Beijing\u2019s behavior as \u201can unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections.\u201d"}
