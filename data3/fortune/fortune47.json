If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2018Stocks fell on Monday after a Bloomberg News report that the administration would move forward with additional tariffs against China in in early December if Trump doesn\u2019t make progress toward resolving its trade dispute during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Markets have already been under pressure from concerns over rising interest rates and peak earnings growth. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes are on track for the steepest monthly declines of the record-long bull market.A Democratic takeover of the House might actually be helpful for markets because gridlock \u201cessentially removes the political factor from the market, allowing fundamentals like sales and earnings to do what they usually do,\u201d Talley Leger, an equity strategist at OppenheimerFunds, said by phone.\u201cIf Washington is in gridlock, politicians can\u2019t screw things up very much,\u201d he said.In data going back to 1901, stocks have returned more when the government is divided than when it\u2019s unified, according to a report by his firm.Trump previously blamed the Federal Reserve for stock declines, complaining after the central bank raised its benchmark policy rate three times this year, by a quarter-percentage point on each occasion. In an interview last week with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he \u201cmaybe\u201d regretted appointing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.Trump said in the interview that Powell \u201calmost looks like he\u2019s happy raising interest rates\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to tell, but maybe\u201d he regrets appointing him.In his tweet Tuesday, Trump said markets were still \u201cmassively up\u201d since his election.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 33 percent since Trump was elected, though the index has declined 1.12 percent since the beginning of the year.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has also argued that politics\u2014rather than the president\u2019s trade policies\u2014are to blame for recent market losses. Earlier this month, he told reporters that stocks may be \u201cgyrating\u201d because investors were worried Democrats in Congress would overturn the president\u2019s economic policies.\u201cBusinesses large, medium, and small do not want the tax cut overturned,\u201d Kudlow said."}
