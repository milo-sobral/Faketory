Every afternoon the two Aunts engage one-on-one with the students to impart cultural knowledge, including painting, cultivating bush tucker, and Indigenous heritage.\"We aim to build an environment of trust and support at Coomaditchie, while maintaining an ongoing relationship with the schools,\" Ms Kellam said.\"We share an agenda of change, hoping to return the students to the school environment with newfound confidence.\"University of Wollongong Australian Health Services Research Institute professor Kathleen Clapham is tracking the program with great interest.\"We're observing how the project is being rolled out, collecting stories from the kids, their parents, and the schools, so that other communities can learn from the experience,\" she said.Jamira Pemberton, one of the 17 students who have passed through the program, said as soon as she saw Coomaditchie she wanted to move in.\"You get one-on-one attention here and it's more like a family environment. Everyone knows each other and has got each other's back,\" she said.\"The most important thing I've been learning here is about my culture, and from Aunty Lorraine I've learnt about painting, including painting Dharawal creation stories. \"I've learnt about the land and the different environments, and also about the history of the missions.\"It's made me look at life completely differently, and that you have to stay focused and work for what you want.\"I've actually finished school, and now I'm doing a course at the South Coast Beauty Academy.\"Jamira's mother Kathy Pemberton has been amazed at the change she has seen in her daughter.\"I was worried when Jamira was at school. It looked like she was heading down the wrong road, and I was really concerned for her, but then when she came out here she turned into a completely different person,\" Ms Pemberton said.\"Jamira absolutely adores Aunty Lorraine and Aunty Narelle, loves listening to them talk about the area, about the heritage.\"The main thing is that now Jamira is very proud of her Aboriginal heritage, is a lot happier in herself, knowing where she belongs and where she came from.\"\nTopics:\nindigenous-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander,\n\n\n\t\n\teducation,\n\n\n\t\n\tindigenous-culture,\n\n\n\t\n\tkemblawarra-2505,\n\n\n\t\n\tuniversity-of-wollongong-2522,\n\n\n\t\n\tport-kembla-2505\n\n\n\n  More\n stories from New South Wales\nin your inbox each week\nSubscribeMore informationIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
