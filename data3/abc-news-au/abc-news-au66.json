But no doubt with all our regulators, be it ASIC or APRA, there will be changes as a result of the Royal Commission's final report.\"APRA will receive the additional funding over four years to improve its supervision programs.\"What we are keen for is a review of APRA's enforcement strategy,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\"So that it uses its formal enforcement powers across the industry it supervises, including superannuation, in the most effective way.\"\nTopics:\ngovernment-and-politics,\n\n\n\t\n\tbanking,\n\n\n\t\n\taustralia\n\n    First posted \n    \n      November 05, 2018 09:08:52\n    \n\n\nContact Brett Worthington\n\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
