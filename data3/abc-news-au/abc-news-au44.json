{"id": "Nobel Prize winner Peter Doherty criticises national interest test on research funding", "paragraph": "\n        Posted \n    \n      October 31, 2018 10:13:23\n    \nA Nobel Prize winner has criticised the Federal Government's overhaul of university research grants, describing it as \"a bad idea\".Education Minister Dan Tehan said there needed to be transparency about how taxpayer money was spent, and for researchers to pass \"a national interest test\" before getting Government funds.That has prompted the Federal Opposition to accuse the Coalition of interfering in academic freedom.Mr Tehan's intervention comes after revelations his predecessor, Simon Birmingham, blocked funding for 11 research projects that had already been approved by the independent Australian Research Council.The projects included \"writing and the literary archive\" ($228,155), \"History of men's dress\" ($325,592), \"Beauty and ugliness in changing China's gender norms\" ($161,774) and \"Post-orientalist arts at the Strait of Gibraltar\" ($222,936).  At the time, universities criticised the decision and said they were not told why their projects were rejected, or if it the decision was made by the council or the minister.The Opposition has been critical of the changes, but Mr Tehan said a national interest test was a common-sense approach used overseas.\"We want to make sure that what the academics put forward as part of their research proposals will benefit Australia over the coming years,\" Mr Tehan said.\"What we want to do is just make it very straightforward and very clear to the Australian people that the $3 billion in Australian taxpayers' money that they're putting forward to help this very important research will benefit us in the long term.\"Australian veterinary surgeon Professor Peter Doherty, who won the Nobel Prize in 1996, dismissed the national interest test as a \"bad idea\".\"Research has to be in the national interest? What does that mean? If it's not in the interests of the coal and gas industry it's not in the national interest?\" Professor Doherty tweeted.  Mr Tehan said that if a minister did intervene to stop funding already approved by the research council, they would have to explain why.\"If the Minister decides not to go ahead, then I have to make note on the brief and we have to inform the person that it was approved by the ARC but not by the Minister,\" he said.\"If there is a problem with a grant \u2026 as the Minister I will ultimately be held responsible and it will be my neck on the line. \"The idea that I am the final overseer of this is a good idea \u2014 we want our ministers held responsible for the decisions they are making.\"Shadow education minister Tanya Plibersek said the national interest test and blocking funding could restrict academic freedom. \"Five minutes ago, the Government were saying that there's not enough academic freedom in our universities and there was too much group-think. And now Dan Tehan wants to be the minister who changes our arms-length grants approval process to one where the politicians decide whether research is good value or good for the country,\" Ms Plibersek said.\"I'd be very surprised if this meets the test of academic freedom.\"One of the most fundamental principles of our universities, the principle of academic freedom, [is] where researchers are free to explore and discover and invent and interrogate without government interference.\"\nTopics:\neducation,\n\n\n\t\n\teducation-industry,\n\n\n\t\n\tuniversity-and-further-education,\n\n\n\t\n\tgovernment-and-politics,\n\n\n\t\n\tfederal-government,\n\n\n\t\n\taustralia\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
