Ms Richards said she started her work with a \"very basic\" sketch using a graphite pencil before applying oil paints.\"Drawing anatomy is a strength of mine.\"I've just applied that to horses, which came through a commission that occurred about four years ago.\"It was for a glossy fashion magazine that was doing a fashion editorial around the spring carnival and needed a couple of large horses for backdrops.\"It just rolled on from there.\" The Black Caviar and Winx paintings took about three months to complete, although with family commitments and children, Ms Richards said she didn't paint 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \"The racing fraternity love their horses and quite often that goes hand in hand with portraits, photographs and memorabilia,\" she said.\"There are lots of facets to how they display their passion in what they do, and portraits are one of them.\"I seem to be placed in a pretty good demographic.\"\nTopics:\npainting,\n\n\n\t\n\thorse-racing,\n\n\n\t\n\tcommunity-and-society,\n\n\n\t\n\tsport,\n\n\n\t\n\tvisual-art,\n\n\n\t\n\tarts-and-entertainment,\n\n\n\t\n\tadelaide-5000,\n\n\n\t\n\tmelbourne-3000\n\n\n\n  More\n stories from South Australia\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
