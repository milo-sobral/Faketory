{"id": "Sculpture by the Sea", "paragraph": "\n      Updated \n    \n      October 23, 2018 10:29:58\n    \nThe annual festival of art and kitsch features 100 works of art arranged along the spectacular coastal walk. Anne Levitch's set of seven astroturfed puzzle pieces is titled \"Turf Wars\". The work references the flux of communities where some people are buying their own patch of turf while others are being turfed out.  This large inflatable work by Cool Shit depicts artist Damien Hirst's search for the shark featured in his iconic shark-in-a-tank installation. \"Space from the One\" is the work of South Korean artist Yong-Hwan Jeon. He specialises in apple forms. \"Horizon\" by Beijing sculptor Mu Boyan is made of stainless steel and references the shifting perceptions of obesity in China. Wajarri Yamatji artist Nicole Monks' work begins with Aboriginal rock carvings on the Tamarama headland. \"Gawura Guruwin\" (Whale Shark) has been redrawn by Gadigal Elder Charles Madden and built with six tonnes of native timber on Tamarama Beach.  As night falls, Gawura Guruwin is set on fire.  Britt Mikkelsen's \"Lair\" pays homage to the iconic funnel web spider. The installation is made of 60kms of biodegradable cotton string. Nearby, a sculpture evokes the pose of Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\". Israeli artist Itamar Freed used a mobile 3D scanner to capture himself. While scanning, the 3D model glitched and fractured because of an algorithm error, creating extra limbs. Sculpture by the Sea runs in Sydney until Nov 4 and in Perth from March 1-18, 2019.
