{"id": "Westpac profit rises 1pc to $8.1b in 'testing year for major banks'", "paragraph": "\n      Updated \n    \n      November 05, 2018 12:27:28\n    \nWestpac's annual net profit has edged 1 per cent higher to $8.1 billion, with the bank's preferred cash profit measure flat and around the same level.The cash result came in slightly below the $8.2 billion estimate from six analysts surveyed by Reuters.The bank noted that it had second-half provisions for customer refunds and related costs, including legal costs, of $281 million, as the fallout from the financial services royal commission continues.\"While the economic environment remains supportive, this result reflects the tough operating conditions for banks, with higher regulatory, compliance, and funding costs, and increased competitive pressure, particularly in the second half,\" Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer said in a statement.However, Westpac said it offset this by increasing \"productivity savings\" by 16 per cent to $304 million during the year.The bank was also at pains to tell investors that it was not seeing any increase in stress in its mortgage book.\"Westpac's mortgage book remains fundamentally sound, with around 70 per cent of Australian customers ahead on repayments [including mortgage offset accounts] and 90-day delinquencies remaining low,\" Mr Hartzer noted.\"We expect house prices to cool further, and investor demand to remain weak. On the other hand, demand from first home buyers is holding up.\"These dynamics are likely to lead to housing credit growth easing to 4 per cent next year, with total credit growth of 3.5 per cent.\"Westpac's investor presentation reveals that interest-only loans have fallen from half of its mortgage book to 35 per cent over the past year-and-a-half. That means more than $50 billion of interest-only loans have switched to principal and interest in the last 18 months.Principal and interest loans have higher repayments now \u2014 often around 40 per cent higher \u2014 but lower repayments over the life of the loan.There have been concerns that the switchover from interest-only repayments to principal and interest might put many borrowers into difficulty with their repayments, but this has yet to show up in a significant increase in mortgage delinquencies for Westpac.Westpac has left its final dividend unchanged at 94 cents per share, fully franked, which takes payouts to shareholders over the full year to 188 cents per share.The bank's shares were down 0.1 per cent to $26.48, similar to NAB and ANZ, which were flat, and better than larger rival CBA (off 1.2 per cent) by 11:36am (AEDT).While zero growth in cash earnings is a disappointing result for investors used to strong returns in most years since the global financial crisis, Westpac's flat result was ahead of the major bank average. Deloitte found that the cash profit for the four major banks as a whole was $2 billion (6.5 per cent) lower at $29.5 billion.It also warned that this situation is unlikely to change in the near future, with lending growth of 3.1 per cent for financial year 2018, which is unlikely to accelerate in the current financial year or beyond.\"The banks are rebuilding their businesses while flying through turbulence with further headwinds ahead,\" wrote Deloitte senior banking partner Paul Wiebusch.\"They will also have to navigate open banking data sharing environments with lending growing at less than 5 per cent, making this the lowest growth rate in a decade.\"Given this 'new normal', the two engines of growth for profitability will be a clearer customer focus and service and product simplification.\"\nTopics:\nbanking,\n\n\n\t\n\tcompany-news,\n\n\n\t\n\taustralia\n\n    First posted \n    \n      November 05, 2018 08:37:05\n    \nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
