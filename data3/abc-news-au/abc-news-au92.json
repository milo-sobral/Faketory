The losses also extended to Asian markets but Tokyo's Nikkei is off its earlier lows and the Shanghai Composite is now in positive territory at 4:45pm (AEDT).\nTopics:\nbusiness-economics-and-finance,\n\n\n\t\n\tmarkets,\n\n\n\t\n\tstockmarket,\n\n\n\t\n\tcurrency,\n\n\n\t\n\taustralia\n\n    First posted \n    \n      November 13, 2018 07:44:19\n    \n\n\nContact David Chau\n\nIf you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
