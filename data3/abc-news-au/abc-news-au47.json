He welcomed the decision to appoint an Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports and said he would consider the report's recommendations. Labor has promised to phase out the live export of sheep if elected at next year's federal election.In April this year, the ALEC said it would support the establishment of an inspector-general for the welfare of exported animals.\"The role of inspector-general would help oversee independence and cultural change in our industry and work constructively with exporters to improve animal welfare outcomes,\" Mr Crean said at the time.delivered to your inbox\nSubscribeMore informationNewsletter Podcasts RSSAustralian woolgrowers have gone against their research body's recommendation, ushering in a 1.5 per cent levy in what was the closest vote in the poll's history.The Australian Government pursues India over export subsidies that have led to a plunge in global sugar prices.Commercial fishers say a Queensland Government plan for 'real time' tracking devices is a case of 'Big Brother gone too far'.A proposed onshore abalone farm on Victoria's south-west coast has residents concerned about the size and location of the development.
