It was just carnage,\" Finch said.\"It was like a car crash in slow motion.\"It's just obviously not doing the basics. I think when that many guys get bowled it's obviously alarming, particularly on a flat surface that didn't swing a hell of a lot.\"Left-arm spinner Imad Wasim snared 3-20 and emulated Cristiano Ronaldo's famous goal celebration for each wicket, in what was his first national outing in almost a year.The tourists got off to a nightmare start when Finch was clean bowled by Imad for a third-ball duck while leaning back into an attempted cut shot.Opening partner D'Arcy Short played onto his stumps three balls later and Glenn Maxwell lasted just seven balls before being dismissed in dismal fashion, slashing at a delivery from paceman Faheem Ashraf which knocked over his middle stump.Second-gamer Ben McDermott's nervous pursuit of a quick single ended in a run out to leave Australia 4-16, while Imad soon had his third wicket luring Alex Carey into an edge with a delivery which deviated slightly and stayed low. Lynn's dismissal brought Coulter-Nile to the crease, and he and Agar steadied the ship until Agar nicked to Hasan Ali.Everything was going right for Pakistan, including Hasan's spectacular outstretched catch on the boundary to see off Adam Zampa.Australia's innings ended unceremoniously with Coulter-Nile bowled by Shadab Khan after inadvertently throwing his bat in an attempted slog.Australia's bowlers earlier held up their end of the bargain to restrict the world's number one-ranked T20 side to 8-155 from 20 overs.Pace duo Billy Stanlake (3-21) and Andrew Tye (3-24) did the bulk of the damage, with Stanlake using his pace and height to devastating effect.White-ball superstar Babar Azam finished unbeaten on 68, while Mohammad Hafeez crunched two sixes on the way to 39.Australia named an unchanged XI from Monday's seven-wicket victory over the UAE, again omitting Test squad members Mitch Marsh, Nathan Lyon, Peter Siddle and Mitchell Starc.Finch said changes would be strongly considered for Friday's second T20 in Dubai, which will also host the third and final game on Sunday.
