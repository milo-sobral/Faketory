Jean managed to open the news bureau in 2012, and was witness to the momentous change brought to North Korea by Kim Jong Il\u2019s death.She had unprecedented opportunities to observe everyday North Koreans during \u2018in-between moments\u2019; when they were doing things other than performing stage-managed spectacles or official business.Jean says her Korean heritage and imperfect language skills meant she was more easily trusted in the factories and villages she visited, despite being the first American many people there had met.This rare access, along with many years of reporting on the politics of the region, and Jean\u2019s own family story, allow her a rare perspective on the peoples of North and South Korea.Jean left Pyongyang in 2014, and now works from Washington, D.C. as a Korean analyst.Jean Lee is Director of the Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History and Public Policy, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for ScholarsJean is in Australia for a series of talks, including a keynote at Griffith University's Integrity 20 (Thursday 24 October)See Jean\u2019s photography and read her journalism on her website Find us on the ABC listen app, or via iTunes, RSS and other podcast apps.Broadcast timesOn ABC Radio Monday to Friday at 11amOn RN Monday to Friday at 3pm, Saturday at 4pmSubscribe the the ABC listen newsletter."}
