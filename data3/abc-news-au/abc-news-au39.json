Singed items of clothing were strewn about outside the shipping container, including a burned shirt.Smashed glass and other debris also littered the ground.A non-disturbance notice has been placed on the site while WorkSafe investigators examine the scene.\nTopics:\nfires,\n\n\n\t\n\tdisasters-and-accidents,\n\n\n\t\n\tfyshwick-2609,\n\n\n\t\n\tcanberra-2600,\n\n\n\t\n\tact,\n\n\n\t\n\taustralia\n\n    First posted \n    \n      October 25, 2018 07:17:46\n    \n\n\n\n  More\n stories from Australian Capital Territory\nWhat have you always wondered about Canberra that you'd like an ABC reporter to investigate?If you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
