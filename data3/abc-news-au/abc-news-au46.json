Mr Jackamarra's aunty Rosina Wade said the family had waited three years for answers about her nephew's death.\"He was making baby steps, getting his licence and trying to get his own accommodation,\" she said.\"There is a lot of questions. \"We know for a fact that he had been in and out of prison and he knew he was only going to be in there for one night pending his bail conditions and his surety coming in the next morning.\"People need to be held accountable.\" Mr Jackamarra's brother Shaquille said the family knew little about the circumstances of his brother's death.\"We have waited three years and no answers have been told to us,\" he said.\"We don't know anything. We just know that he passed in the custody of Broome Prison after attending court that morning.\"We were shocked. Still today we are finding it hard to accept.\"Not-for-profit human rights law firm The National Justice Project is representing Mr Jackamarra's family at the inquest.Senior solicitor Emma Hearne said she hoped the inquest would help prevent more deaths in custody.\"It was a tragic loss of life, Mr Jackamarra had only been in custody for less than three hours [at the prison] when he passed away and he was due to be released on bail the next morning,\" she said.\"Even though three years have passed, the lack of answers for the family will mean that [the inquest] will be quite a difficult few days.\"\nTopics:\nindigenous-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander,\n\n\n\t\n\taboriginal,\n\n\n\t\n\tcommunity-and-society,\n\n\n\t\n\tblack-deaths-in-custody,\n\n\n\t\n\tdeath,\n\n\n\t\n\tlaw-crime-and-justice,\n\n\n\t\n\tcourts-and-trials,\n\n\n\t\n\tindigenous-protocols,\n\n\n\t\n\tindigenous-policy,\n\n\n\t\n\tindigenous-culture,\n\n\n\t\n\tcrime-prevention,\n\n\n\t\n\tcrime,\n\n\n\t\n\tsuicide,\n\n\n\t\n\tmens-health,\n\n\n\t\n\tmental-health,\n\n\n\t\n\tbroome-6725,\n\n\n\t\n\tperth-6000,\n\n\n\t\n\tkarratha-6714,\n\n\n\t\n\tkununurra-6743,\n\n\n\t\n\tsydney-2000,\n\n\n\t\n\tmelbourne-3000,\n\n\n\t\n\tcanberra-2600,\n\n\n\t\n\tdarwin-0800,\n\n\n\t\n\talice-springs-0870\n\n\nContact Rhiannon Shine\n\n\n\n\n  More\n stories from Western Australia\nWhat have you always wondered about Canberra that you'd like an ABC reporter to investigate?If you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.ABC teams share the story behind the story and insights into the making of digital, TV and radio content.Read about our editorial guiding principles and the enforceable standard our journalists follow.\n        By Mary LloydIn light of the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and poison attack on Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal, what do countries gain from assassination attempts?\n        By James BennettIn the secluded town of Paradise, James Bennett finds carnage and destruction reminiscent of Victoria's Black Saturday fires \u2014 and a community with the same grit to start over.Not every video sees the light of day the first time round.
