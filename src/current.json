All rights reserved.\n      All market data delayed 20 minutes.\n    Part 1 of Chris Wallace's exclusive 'Fox News Sunday' interview with President Trump.President Trump, speaking exclusively to Fox News' Chris Wallace in a wide-ranging interview, revealed what President Obama told him was the biggest challenge facing the U.S.,\u00a0discussed potential high-level departures from his administration\u00a0and admitted that he occasionally enjoys calling on CNN reporter Jim Acosta.\"Actually I like to do it, but in many cases I don\u2019t,\" Trump acknowledged. In ruling that the administration temporarily has to restore Acosta's White House access pass on Fifth Amendment due process grounds, federal judge\u00a0Timothy J. Kelly noted that Trump could simply choose to ignore Acosta. (The judge, in his preliminary decision, did not rule on CNN's First Amendment claim.)But Trump, speaking to Wallace, floated another idea for handling Acosta.\"I think one of the things we\u2019ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don\u2019t have any air time, although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,\" Trump mused.\u00a0\"I mean, with this stuff you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\"Calling Acosta \"unbelievably rude to [White House press secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who\u2019s a wonderful woman,\" Trump said his administration is currently formulating \"rules and regulations\" for White House reporters. \"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" the president added.\n      As President Donald Trump points to CNN's Jim Acosta, a White House aide takes the microphone from him during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n      Trump also defended\u00a0Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker against Democrats' calls that he should recuse himself because he has written critically of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.\"I did not know that,\" Trump said, when asked if he was aware prior to appointing him that Whitaker had argued\u00a0Mueller's authority and funding could justifiably be limited. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"SEN. FLAKE VOWS TO BOYCOTT GOP JUDICIAL NOMINEES UNLESS MUELLER PROTECTION LEGISLATION GETS A VOTE -- BUT GOP RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUESTrump added that he \"would not get involved\" in Whitaker's decisions as he oversees Mueller's probe in his new role as head of the Justice Department. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel\u00a0issued an opinion affirming the constitutionality of Whitaker's temporary\u00a0appointment without Senate approval.\"Look he -- it\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump said.\u00a0I think he\u2019s very well aware politically.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s astute politically.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very smart person.\u00a0 A very respected person.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\u00a0 I really believe he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right.\"\n      FILE -Then-Iowa Republican senatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney Matt Whitaker watches before a live televised debate in Johnston, Iowa.\n      (Associated Press)The president added that he has personally responded to Mueller's written questions in the Russia probe and that they would be submitted \"very soon.\" Trump said his team is \"writing what I tell them to write\" in response to the inquiries.Turning to another one of his frequent critics -- former President Barack Obama -- Trump took something of a victory lap, following news that some of the top candidates Obama had\u00a0backed in the midterm elections had come up short.FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: WHITAKER TELLS SEN. GRAHAM HE SEES NO NEED TO RECUSE HIMSELF\"I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor,\" Trump said, referring to defeated Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams' top surrogates. \"And it was all stacked against Brian [Kemp], and I was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won.\" (Abrams acknowledged in a fiery speech this week that she would not win the race, but strongly suggested Republican Brian Kemp had prevailed because of voter suppression, and vowed a lawsuit.)\"Look at Florida,\" Trump continued.\u00a0\"I went down to Florida.\u00a0[GOP Senate candidate] Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end.\u00a0 And if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have\u00a0lost that election, OK?\u00a0 In my opinion he would have lost.\u00a0 They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.\"The results of a manual recount in the Florida Senate will be reported on Sunday, and Scott is expected to prevail over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, following a series of lawsuits and snafus that exposed long-running issues with ballot counting in the state.

[bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we\u2019re supporting Pakistan, we\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year --which we don\u2019t give them anymore, by the way, I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\"And Trump sounded a note of regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetary in Washington, D.C., on Veterans Day -- which Obama did every year while he was in office.\"I should have done that,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling, as you know. ...\u00a0\u00a0I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year.\u00a0 But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.\"'EMERGENCY' NYC PROTEST AGAINST SESSIONS PROTEST HEADS THROUGH D.C. -- HIGH ON ENERGY, IRONYTrump, who spent nearly an hour Thursday at the\u00a0Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. -- where tables were lined with miniature pumpkin pies ahead of Thanksgiving -- said he has some plans to potentially visit U.S. troops stationed\u00a0in Iraq and Afghanistan for the first time.\"Well, I think you will see that happen,\" the president said, after Wallace noted that Obama and former President George W. Bush had each visited soldiers in war zones.\u00a0\"There are things that are being planned.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else.\"Explaining why he canceled a trip to visit a World War I memorial ceremony in Paris, Trump cited the weather and sharply criticized the media for making a \"big deal\" out of the situation. The president noted he attended an event the next day in the rain at a cemetary just\u00a0outside Paris on Armistice Day.\"They said, 'Sir,' the Secret Service said, 'Sir, you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go,'\" Trump said.\u00a0\"Because it was supposed to be helicopter, but the helicopter couldn\u2019t fly because of zero visibility.\"\n      Two Central American migrants walk along the top of the border structure separating Mexico and the United States Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Tijuana, Mexico.

The first members of a large Central American migrant caravan arrived in the Mexican city of Tijuana last week and were photographed\u00a0attempting to climb a border fence there.\"Well, I like her a lot.\u00a0I respect her a lot,\" Trump said, referring to Nielsen.\u00a0\"She\u2019s very smart.\u00a0 I want her to get much tougher and we\u2019ll see what happens there.\u00a0But I want to be extremely tough. ...\u00a0\u00a0I like her very much, I respect her very much, I\u2019d like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period.\"He added there's a \"chance\" that Nielsen, who was accosted in a restaurant this summer by far-left progressive activists as her security detail kept close watch,\u00a0will continue in her role.\n      A Catholic nun gives travel advice to Central American migrants riding in the bed of a semi-trailer, as they move toward the U.S. border, in Ixtl\u00e1n del Rio, Nayarit, Mexico, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

He\u2019s doing an excellent job in many ways.\u00a0There are a couple of things where it\u2019s just not his strength.\u00a0It\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s not his strength. ...\u00a0But John, at some point, is going to want to move on.\u00a0John will move on.\"\n      White House Chief of Staff John Kelly takes questions from the media while addressing the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 12, 2017.

But, frankly, she is not -- she\u2019ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way. ...\u00a0She\u2019s not too diplomatic, but she\u2019s talented.\"Taking stock of the administration's progress after two years, amid some past and apparently pending roster changes,\u00a0Trump gave himself high marks -- literally.\"I think I\u2019m doing a great job.\u00a0 We have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had,\" the president\u00a0said. \"We\u2019re doing really well. We would have been at war with North Korea if, let\u2019s say, that administration continued forward.\"Trump continued: \"I would give myself, I would \u2013 look, I hate to do it, but I will do it, I would give myself an A+, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\"This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92018 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes."}
